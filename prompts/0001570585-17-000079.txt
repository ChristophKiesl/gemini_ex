PART I
Item 1.    BUSINESS
Who We Are
We are Liberty Global plc (Liberty Global), the world's largest international television and broadband company—investing, innovating and empowering our customers to be a part of the digital revolution. We are investing in the communication highways of our age. These investments include acquisitions, network extensions and expansion, technology upgrades and our initiatives to engage our people, our customers and the communities in which we operate. Our investments put us at the center of the digital revolution and allow us to drive global innovation through new products, opportunities and applications. We are innovating through technology by building a strong convergence of fixed and mobile communication opportunities reaching gigabit speeds. It is through our operations that we bring the benefits of our global innovation to life. We empower our customers with quality services and products that give them the freedom to connect, converse, work and be entertained anytime, anywhere they choose. We believe our enhanced digital products and services will deliver customer satisfaction, enhance our revenue streams and generate cost savings—the goals of our “Liberty GO” program. For further information on Liberty GO, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview included in Part II of this Annual Report.
Liberty Global has operations in more than 30 countries serving 24.7 million customers at December 31, 2016. We consolidate these operations listed below, with the exception of VodafoneZiggo (defined below).

General Development of Business
As a result of a series of mergers that were completed on June 7, 2013, Liberty Global became the publicly-held parent company of the successors by merger of Liberty Global, Inc. (the predecessor to Liberty Global) and Virgin Media Inc. (Virgin Media). In the following text, the terms “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) or collectively to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated as of December 31, 2016, and operational data, including subscriber statistics and ownership percentages, are as of December 31, 2016.
On December 31, 2016, our company and Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) formed a 50:50 joint venture, called VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V. (VodafoneZiggo). VodafoneZiggo combined our subsidiary VodafoneZiggo Holding B.V., formerly known as Ziggo Group Holding B.V. (Ziggo Group Holding), with Vodafone’s mobile business in the Netherlands to create a national unified communications provider in the Netherlands with complementary strengths across video, broadband, mobile and business services. As a result of the formation of VodafoneZiggo, effective December 31, 2016, we treat VodafoneZiggo as an equity method investment and no longer consolidate Ziggo Group Holding. For additional information on this transaction, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Expansion and Acquisitions
We have expanded our broadband footprint through new build projects and strategically selected acquisitions. Our new build projects consist of network extension programs pursuant to which we connect additional homes and businesses to our broadband communications network (Network Extensions). Our investment in Network Extensions is critical not only for our business to grow, but also for the countries and communities in which we operate. The Network Extensions, together with upgrades to our existing networks and next generation customer premises equipment, provide our customers the means to enter the gigaworld society. During 2016, we initiated Network Extensions in the Germany, Chile, Central and Eastern Europe and certain other markets. During 2015 and 2016, we connected 567,000 homes and commercial premises to Virgin Media’s two-way network (including technical upgrades in the United Kingdom (U.K.)). During 2016, we connected approximately 1.0 million homes and commercial premises (including upgrades in Germany and Chile) to our two-way networks in the other markets mentioned above. Pursuant to Network Extensions, in 2017, we expect to (1) connect 1.3 million to 1.4 million additional homes and commercial premises (excluding upgrades) to our two-way networks attributed to the “Liberty Global Group” (as defined and described below) and (2) connect or upgrade approximately 450,000 additional homes and commercial premises to our two-way networks attributed to the “LiLAC Group” (as defined and described below). Depending on a variety of factors, however, including the financial and operations results of the earlier phases of our new build programs, any Network Extensions may be continued, modified or cancelled at our discretion. For further information on Network Extensions, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview included in Part II of this Annual Report. 
Over the past decade, we have also completed several strategic acquisitions both in Europe and in Latin America. We made these acquisitions in order to deliver the scale that allows us to innovate effectively and invest in great content and the best products. This enables us to deliver quality services to our customers. Our significant acquisitions include:

• | On May 16, 2016, we acquired Cable & Wireless Communications Limited (CWC), a provider of telecommunication services, including mobile and high-speed broadband, focused in Latin America and the Caribbean (the CWC Acquisition).


• | On February 11, 2016, Telenet Group Holding N.V. (Telenet) acquired BASE Company N.V. (BASE), the third-largest mobile network operator in Belgium.


• | On June 3, 2015, we acquired, together with investment funds affiliated with Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. (Searchlight), Choice Cable TV (Choice), a cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico, which was integrated into our Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC (Liberty Puerto Rico) operations.


• | In November 2014, we gained control of Ziggo Holding B.V. (Ziggo), a provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in the Netherlands, and integrated Ziggo into our Netherlands broadband operations. This business was contributed to form VodafoneZiggo, a 50:50 joint venture, on December 31, 2016.


• | On November 8, 2012, we completed a series of transactions with Searchlight through which we acquired San Juan Cable LLC, dba OneLink Communications, a broadband communications operator in Puerto Rico.

I-2


• | On December 15, 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Kabel BW Musketeer GmbH, Germany’s third largest cable television operator based on number of subscribers, and integrated it into our Unitymedia GmbH (Unitymedia) operations.


• | On September 16, 2011, we acquired Aster Sp. Z.o.o., a broadband communications provider in Poland.


• | On January 28, 2010, we acquired Unitymedia, the second largest cable television provider in Germany based on the number of subscribers.

For additional information on our more recent acquisitions, including related financings, see notes 4 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we have completed various other smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business.
Pending Acquisitions
Recently, we announced two additional acquisitions related to our operations in Europe:

• | In December 2016, Telenet reached an agreement to acquire from Coditel Brabant sprl, operating under the brand SFR and a subsidiary of Altice S.A., its broadband operations in Belgium and Luxembourg. Subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, closing is expected during the second half of 2017.


• | In October 2016, through a subsidiary of UPC Holding B.V. (UPC Holding), we entered into an agreement to acquire the cable business of Multimedia Polska S.A., a broadband communications provider in Poland. Subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, closing is expected in late 2017 or early 2018.

For additional information on the above proposed acquisitions, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Dispositions
In addition to the contribution of Ziggo Group Holding and its subsidiaries to VodafoneZiggo, we completed the following dispositions: 

• | On January 31, 2014, we sold substantially all of our programming interest held through Chellomedia B.V.


• | On July 11, 2011, we sold Austar United Communications Limited, a leading direct-to-home satellite (DTH) provider to regional and rural Australia and the capital cities of Hobart and Darwin.


• | On February 18, 2010, we sold our ownership interest in Jupiter Telecommunications Co. Ltd., dba J:COM, a leading broadband provider and the largest multiple-system operator in Japan based on homes passed and subscribers.

For additional information on the Chellomedia B.V. disposition, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have also completed various other smaller dispositions in the normal course of business and as required by regulatory authorities in connection with approving the BASE and Ziggo acquisitions. 
Tracking Shares
On July 1, 2015, we completed the approved steps of the “LiLAC Transaction” whereby we (1) reclassified our then outstanding Class A, Class B and Class C Liberty Global ordinary shares (collectively, the Old Liberty Global Shares) into corresponding classes of new Liberty Global ordinary shares (collectively, the Liberty Global Shares) and (2) capitalized a portion of our share premium account and distributed as a dividend (or a “bonus issue” under U.K. law) our LiLAC Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary shares (collectively, the LiLAC Shares). Pursuant to the LiLAC Transaction, each holder of Class A, Class B and Class C Old Liberty Global Shares remained a holder of the same amount and class of Liberty Global Shares and received one share of the corresponding class of LiLAC Shares for each 20 Old Liberty Global Shares held as of the record date for such distribution and cash was issued in lieu of fractional LiLAC Shares. 
The Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are tracking shares. Tracking shares are intended by the issuing company to reflect or “track” the economic performance of a particular business or “group,” rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. The Liberty Global Shares and the LiLAC Shares are intended to track the economic performance of the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group, respectively (each as defined and described below). While 
I-3

the Liberty Global Group and the LiLAC Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, neither group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Holders of tracking shares have no direct claim to the group’s assets and are not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking shares are shareholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors, and are subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation. We and our subsidiaries each continue to be responsible for our respective liabilities. Holders of Liberty Global Shares, LiLAC Shares and any other of our capital shares designated as ordinary shares from time to time will continue to be subject to risks associated with an investment in our company as a whole, even if a holder does not own both Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares.
The LiLAC Group comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean and has attributed to it (1) LGE Coral Holdco Limited and its subsidiaries, which include CWC, (2) VTR Finance B.V. (VTR Finance) and its subsidiaries, which include VTR.com SpA (VTR), (3) Lila Chile Holding B.V., which is the parent entity of VTR Finance, (4) LiLAC Communications Inc., formerly known as LiLAC Holdings Inc. (LiLAC Communications), and its subsidiaries, which include Liberty Puerto Rico, and (5) prior to July 1, 2015, the costs associated with certain corporate employees of Liberty Global that are exclusively focused on the management of the LiLAC Group. Effective July 1, 2015, these corporate employees were transferred to LiLAC Communications. The Liberty Global Group comprises our businesses, assets and liabilities not attributed to the LiLAC Group, including Virgin Media, Unitymedia, Telenet and UPC Holding, including our DTH satellite operations based in Luxembourg, our corporate entities (excluding LiLAC Communications), our 50% interest in VodafoneZiggo and certain other less significant entities. 
Equity Transactions 
From time to time our board of directors authorize various shares repurchase programs. Under these programs, we receive authorization to acquire up to the specified amount of our ordinary shares or other authorized securities from time to time through open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may include derivative transactions. The timing of the repurchase of shares or other securities pursuant to our equity repurchase programs, which may be suspended or discontinued at any time, is dependent on a variety of factors, including market conditions. Pursuant to our share repurchase programs, during 2016, we repurchased: 

Title of Shares | | Number of Shares | Weighted Average Price | | Aggregate Purchase Price*
 | | | | | in millions 
Liberty Global Class A | 32,387,722 | | $ | 32.26 | | $ | 1,044.8
Liberty Global Class C | 31,557,089 | | $ | 32.43 | | $ | 1,023.2
LiLAC Class A | 720,800 | | $ | 20.65 | | $ | 14.8 
LiLAC Class C | 313,647 | | $ | 21.19 | | $ | 6.7 

_______________
* Includes direct acquisition costs and the effects of derivative instruments. 
At December 31, 2016, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases of Liberty Global Shares and LiLAC Shares was $1,943.4 million and $278.6 million, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, our board of directors increased the amount authorized under the share repurchase program for our Liberty Global Shares by $1.0 billion. For a further description of our share repurchases, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Narrative Description of Business
We are a leading international telecommunications company with a commitment to providing our customers the “best in class” communications and entertainment services. These services are delivered to our residential and business customers over our networks and include video, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services. We also deliver mobile services through third-party networks as MVNOs. We design these services to enable our customers to access the digital world on their own terms and at their own pace. In most of our footprint, the core of our offer is “triple-play”, which we use to describe bundled services of digital video, internet and telephony in one subscription. We are enhancing this offer by expanding our services to include mobile services for a “quad-play” or fixed-mobile convergence service in most of our markets. Available service offerings depend on the bandwidth capacity of a particular system and whether it has been upgraded for two-way communications. In certain markets, we also offer video services through DTH and fiber-to-the-home and digital subscriber line (DSL) networks. In addition, in the Caribbean and certain markets in Latin America, we provide wholesale services over our sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks.
Our operations are attributed to either our Liberty Global Group or our LiLAC Group. The Liberty Global Group includes our operations in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria and Central and Eastern Europe. In terms of video subscribers, we operate the largest cable network in each of Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the U.K. and the second largest cable network in each of Germany and Romania. The Liberty Global Group also includes our investment in VodafoneZiggo, which operates the largest cable network in the Netherlands, and in various content businesses.
The LiLAC Group includes our operations in Chile and Puerto Rico and our CWC operations primarily in the Caribbean and Latin America, including sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks connecting over 30 markets throughout the region. In terms of video subscribers, we operate the largest fixed network capable of delivering video services in each of Chile, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and five other Caribbean markets. In terms of fixed-line telephony subscribers, we operate the largest telephony network in each of Panama, Jamaica, Barbados, Bahamas and in almost all of our other Caribbean countries where we provide retail services.
In connecting our customers through our telecommunication services, we recognize that we are a global corporate citizen—that we play a role in addressing the environmental impacts generated through our business. By seeking to address these issues, we strengthen our company and positively influence the communities in which we operate. This includes enhancing the energy efficiency of all our operations, with a focus on energy use, carbon emissions and management of electronic waste. We also recognize that coding skills are essential to our industry and other technology-based jobs of the future. As a result, we have partnered with the CoderDojo Foundation, a global community of free coding clubs for children age 7-17. Our support for CoderDojo is enabling the next generation of creators, improving their long-term career prospects. Corporate responsibility is a key part of our business strategy.

__________________

(1) | Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH homes. Our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count homes passed for DTH. Due to the fact that we do not own the partner networks (defined below) used in Switzerland (see note 11 below), we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s partner networks.


(2) | Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services, including video, internet and telephony services.


(3) | Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we count as Revenue Generating Units (RGUs), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include equivalent billing unit (EBU) adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our Customer Relationship counts. For further information regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes to Tables below. Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Customer Relationships.


(4) | RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber (each as defined and described below). A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in our Austrian market subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video, DTH, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers, free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our December 31, 2016 RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.


(5) | Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes conditional access security cards or “smart cards”, or other integrated or virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. With the exception of RGUs that we count on an EBU basis, we count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs. In Europe, we have approximately 164,900 “lifeline” customers that are counted on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels.


(6) | Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or through a partner network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers that are not counted on an EBU basis are counted on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced video services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our Enhanced Video Subscribers. Subscribers to enhanced video services provided by our operations in Switzerland over partner networks receive basic video services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations.


(7) | DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast directly via a geosynchronous satellite.


(8) | Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Our Internet Subscribers exclude 45,700 and 45,600 DSL subscribers within Belgium and Austria, respectively, who are not serviced over our networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections. In Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 97,400 subscribers who have requested and received this service.


(9) | Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. Our Telephony Subscribers exclude 34,900 subscribers within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include 88,900 subscribers who have requested and received this service.

I-9


(10) | Mobile Subscriber is an active subscriber identification module (SIM) card in service rather than services provided. For example, if a Mobile Subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one Mobile Subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two Mobile Subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our Mobile Subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country.


(11) | Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services over networks owned by third-party cable operators (partner networks). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer. At December 31, 2016, Switzerland’s partner networks account for 138,600 Customer Relationships, 290,900 RGUs, 106,300 Enhanced Video Subscribers, 108,500 Internet Subscribers and 76,100 Telephony Subscribers.

Additional General Notes to Table:
As a result of our decision to discontinue our Multi-channel Multipoint Distribution System (MMDS) service in Ireland, we have excluded subscribers to our MMDS service from our externally reported operating statistics effective January 1, 2016, which resulted in a reduction to Homes Passed, RGUs and Customer Relationships in Ireland and Slovakia of 22,000 and 500, respectively. 
Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other business services. Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office (SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or fixed-line telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.
Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including certain commercial and residential multiple dwelling units in Europe (with the exception of Germany and Belgium, where we do not count any RGUs on an EBU basis). Our EBUs are generally calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely as a result of changes in rates. In Germany, homes passed reflect the footprint, and two-way homes passed reflect the technological capability of our network up to the street cabinet, with drops from the street cabinet to the building generally added, and in-home wiring generally upgraded, on an as needed or success-based basis. In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term capital lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet’s owned and leased networks. 
While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform, (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews. 
Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

Liberty Global Group Products and Services
Video Services
Our video service is, and continues to be, one of the key foundations of our product offerings in our European markets. Our cable operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting with a basic video service. Subscribers to our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and generally receive at least 60 digital or analog video channels (including a limited number of high definition (HD) channels) and several digital and analog radio channels. This service also includes video-on-demand (VoD) access and an electronic programming guide. In our markets where our basic digital service is unencrypted (Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania), the cost of our digital service is the same cost as the monthly fee of our analog service. In the markets where we encrypt our basic digital service, our digital service is generally offered at an incremental cost equal to or slightly higher than the monthly fee for our basic analog service. We tailor our video services in each country of operation based on programming preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. Our channel offerings include general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and foreign channels. 
We also offer a variety of premium channel packages to meet the special interests of our subscribers. For an additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video and radio channels, including the channels in the basic tier service and additional HD channels. Digital subscribers may also subscribe to one or more packages of premium channels for an additional monthly charge.
Subscribers to our digital services also receive the channels available through our analog service. We offer limited analog services in all of our broadband markets, except in the U.K. and Switzerland. In all of our broadband operations, we continue to upgrade our systems to expand our digital services and encourage our analog subscribers to convert to a digital or premium digital service.
Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of our services (bundled services): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in certain markets, mobile services. Bundled services consist of double-play for two services, triple-play for three services and, where available, quad-play for four services. 
To meet customer demands, we have enhanced our video services with various products that enable our customers to control when, where and how they watch their programming.  These products range from digital video recorders (DVRs) to multimedia home gateway systems such as "Horizon TV", as well as various mobile applications (apps). Horizon TV is a next generation multimedia home gateway (decoder box) based on a digital television platform that is capable of distributing video, voice and data content throughout the home and to multiple devices. It has a sophisticated user interface that enables customers to view and share, across multiple devices, linear channels, VoD programming and personal media content and to pause, replay and record programming. The Horizon TV gateway can act as an internet router that allows access to digital video content available on the television via other devices, such as laptops, smart phones and tablets. 
For our Horizon TV subscribers, we offer various features and functionalities, including over 330 television apps for various online services (such as YouTube, Netflix, social platforms, sports experience, music, news and games). In almost all of our operations, we also offer an online mobile app for viewing on a second screen called “Horizon Go”. Horizon Go is available on mobile devices (iOS, Android and Windows) and via an internet portal and allows video customers to view linear channels and VoD, with a substantial part of this content available outside of the home. For Horizon TV customers, when in the home the second screen device can act as a remote control. Through Horizon Go, customers have the ability to remotely schedule the recording of a television program on their Horizon TV box at home. 
We offer Horizon TV in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Poland and the Czech Republic. In several of our other European operations, we provide a Horizon TV-like experience through a remote upgrade of the software on the customer’s set-top box. After the upgrade, these boxes offer several features of the Horizon TV product. We refer to this upgrade as “Horizon Lite”, although it is locally marketed as Horizon TV, except in Belgium where it is marketed as “Digital TV”. Some of the Horizon TV features are not available on our Horizon Lite systems, such as recommendation-based content and the ability to access video content on other devices in the home. We intend to (1) expand the availability of Horizon TV to other markets within our footprint and (2) continue to improve the Horizon TV user experience with new functionality and software updates. 
In the U.K., we offer a multimedia home gateway based on the TiVo platform under a strategic partnership agreement with TiVo Inc.  The TiVo set-top boxes provide television and broadband internet capabilities. In late 2016, we launched a new set-top box in the U.K. called the Virgin Media V6 box. This device combines ultra high-definition 4K video with improved streaming functionalities and more processing power. The Virgin Media V6 box allows customers to record six channels simultaneously while watching a seventh. Customers can also start watching programming on one television and pick up where they left off on 
I-15

other TiVo boxes in another room or through an app on their smart phones and tablets. A similar box will be rolled out in other markets in our footprint, where it will carry the next generation Horizon TV user interface and will be marketed under the respective local brand. In addition to the video service on their TiVo gateway device, our customers in the U.K. also have access to a comprehensive internet streaming video service called “Virgin TV Anywhere”. This service, which is available via a mobile app or an internet portal, allows our video customers to stream real-time TV channels and watch VoD content anywhere they have a broadband connection. 
In Belgium, the digital video product offered by Telenet is based on system marketed as Digital TV platform. It functions similar to our Horizon Lite service and is available to Telenet's enhanced video subscribers for no additional charge. Digital TV set-top boxes offer a Horizon-like user interface that allows Telenet's enhanced video customers to remotely manage their DVR, view programs remotely (up to seven days after the original broadcast) and access VoD with a laptop, smart phone or tablet in or out of the home. Telenet also offers customers access to live TV streaming and various other content sources such as VoD via the “Yelo Play” app, which is available via iOS, Android and Windows smart phones and tablets. 
One of our key video services is “Replay TV”. Replay TV records virtually all programs across numerous linear channels in the countries where this service is available. The recordings are available up to seven days after the original broadcast. This allows our customers to catch up on their favorite television shows without having to set their DVR or browse separate menus on their set-top boxes. Instead, customers can open the electronic programing guide, scroll back and replay linear programming instantly. Replay TV also allows our customers to replay a television program from the start even while the live broadcast is in progress. Replay TV is accessible in Switzerland, Belgium, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia through Horizon TV or Horizon Lite, and in some of our European markets also via Horizon Go. At the 2016 Content Innovation Awards, Liberty Global, together with its former subsidiary Ziggo Group Holding (now part of VodafoneZiggo), received the Pay TV Initiative for the Year Award for its Replay TV service. 
In most of our markets, we offer pay-per-view programming through VoD giving subscribers access to thousands of movies and television series. In several of our European markets, our subscription VoD service “MyPrime” is available for an additional fee with our basic video services and is included in our enhanced video services accessed through the Horizon TV platform. MyPrime is tailored to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers. In Germany, subscription VoD is available through a partnership with Maxdome GmbH, and in Belgium, the service is marketed under “Play” and “Play More”. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming from local and international suppliers, such as ABC/Disney, A+E Networks, NBC/Universal, CBS/Paramount, the BBC, Warner TV and Sony, among others. 
Our VoD services, including catch-up TV, are available on a subscription basis or a transaction basis, depending on the tier of enhanced video service selected by the subscriber. Customers who subscribe to an extended digital tier generally receive a VoD enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. The subscription-based VoD service includes various programming, such as music, kids, documentaries, adult, sports and television series. 
Subscribers access our enhanced video service by renting a set-top box with a smart card from our operators, or without a set-top box if a subscriber is only using our basic video service. Where Horizon TV is available, a subscriber to our enhanced video services has the option, for an incremental monthly charge, to upgrade the standard digital set-top box to a Horizon TV box (which has HD DVR capabilities and other additional features). No set-top box or smart card, however, is required to receive our basic digital services in our unencrypted footprints. In addition, expanded channel packages and premium channels and services are available for an incremental monthly fee in all of our markets.
WiFi and Internet Services
Connectivity is a building block for vibrant communities. As the largest international cable company, our fiber-rich broadband network is the backbone of our business and the basis of our connectivity strategy. To meet our customers’ expectations to be seamlessly connected, we are investing in the expansion of our broadband network, mobile and WiFi solutions and customer premises equipment.
Internet speed is of crucial importance to our customers, as they spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. Our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra high-speed internet service across our markets. Our residential subscribers in Europe access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, or wirelessly via a WiFi gateway device. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service ranging from a basic service of 10 Mbps in Germany to an ultra high-speed internet service of 500 Mbps in Switzerland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. The speed of service depends on the location and the tier of service selected. In addition, by leveraging our existing fiber-rich broadband networks and our Network Extension programs, we are well positioned to deliver gigabit services in our European markets. To 
I-16

this end, by deploying the next generation DOCSIS 3.1 technology, we have the potential to extend our download speeds to at least 1 Gbps when fully deployed. DOCSIS technology is an international standard that defines the requirements for data transmission over a cable system. Currently, our ultra high-speed internet service is based primarily on DOCSIS 3.0 technology. 
Our internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls. We offer value-added broadband services in certain of our markets for an incremental charge. These services include security (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and spam protection) and online storage solutions and web spaces. In many of our markets, we offer mobile broadband services with internet access as described below. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors. 
In late 2015, we introduced the "Connect Box", a dedicated connectivity device that delivers superior in-home WiFi coverage.  The Connect Box is our next generation WiFi and telephony gateway that enables us to maximize the impact of our ultrafast broadband networks by providing reliable wireless connectivity anywhere in the home. It has an automatic WiFi optimization function, which selects the best possible wireless frequency at any given time. This gateway can be self-installed and allows customers to customize their home WiFi service. Our Connect Box is available in all our European markets. Robust wireless connectivity is increasingly important with our customers spending more and more time using bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. 
In almost all of our European markets, we have deployed community WiFi via routers in the home (the Community WiFi), which provides a secure access to the internet for our customers. Community WiFi is enabled by a cable modem WiFi access point (WiFi modem) in the Connect Box, the set-top box or the Horizon TV box of our internet customers. The Community WiFi is created through the sharing of access to the public channel of our customers’ home wireless routers. Use of the Community WiFi does not affect the internet speeds of our customers. The public channel is a separate network from the secure private network used by the customer within the home and is automatically enabled when the WiFi modem is installed. Access is free for our internet customers. At December 31, 2016, we had 5.3 million WiFi access points in our Liberty Global Group footprint. In addition, our internet customers continue to have access to the Community WiFi in the Netherlands. We continue to expand our Community WiFi service throughout our European markets. 
In the U.K., Virgin Media’s customers have access to an extensive network of public WiFi access points, including in the London underground train stations. Public WiFi access points (covering train stations, hotels, bars, restaurants and other public places) are also available to Unitymedia customers in Germany and to Telenet customers in Belgium. In Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, Poland, Ireland and Romania, we are expanding our Community WiFi through access points covering public places. Our Community WiFi is branded as “Wi-Free” in most of our markets. Through an agreement with Comcast Corporation, our internet customers will also have access to millions of WiFi access points in the U.S. and across various European countries for no additional cost.
Mobile Services
Mobile services are another key building block for us to provide customers with seamless connectivity. We offer mobile services as an MVNO over third-party networks in the U.K., Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland and Hungary. Following the February 2016 acquisition of BASE, Telenet became a mobile network provider in Belgium and plans to migrate its current and future mobile subscribers to the BASE network prior to the termination of its MVNO agreement with a third-party provider at the end of 2018. We plan to add MVNO arrangements and, where appropriate, acquire or partner with mobile service providers with their own networks in all our broadband communication markets. 
In Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Hungary and, through 2018, Belgium, we provide our mobile telephony services as full MVNOs through partnerships with a third-party mobile network operator in their respective footprints of our country operations. All of these operations lease the third-party’s radio access network and own the core network, including switching, backbone and interconnections. These arrangements permit us to offer our customers in these markets mobile services without having to build and operate a cellular radio tower network. Beginning in 2017, our mobile operations in the U.K. will move from a light MVNO to a full MVNO arrangement due to a revised agreement with the third-party network provider. In Germany, we provide mobile telephony as a light MVNO. In this case, we lease the core network as well as the radio access network from a mobile network operator. This arrangement permits our German customers to have access to the third-party mobile communications services while we maintain the customer relationship. 
Where mobile services are available subscribers pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is combined with our fixed-line telephony service or includes mobile data services via mobile phones, tablets or laptops. We offer our customers 
I-17

the option to purchase mobile handsets and, in the U.K., Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland and Hungary, make such purchase pursuant to a contract independent of their mobile services contract. We refer to these arrangements as split contracts. 
We typically charge a one-time activation fee to our customers for each SIM card. Our mobile services typically include voice, short message service (or SMS) and internet access. Calls, both within and out of network, incur a charge or are covered under a postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services are primarily on a postpaid basis with customers subscribing to services for periods ranging from activation for a SIM-only contract to up to 24 months, with the latter often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. In Belgium, Switzerland and Austria, however, our postpaid service is offered without a minimum contract term. In the U.K. and Belgium, we also offer a prepaid service, where the customers pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally have no minimum contract term. In almost all of our markets, subscribers to a double-or triple-play bundle receive a discount on their mobile service fee. 
Telephony Services
Multi-feature telephony services are available through voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology in most of our broadband communication markets. In the U.K. and Hungary, we also provide traditional circuit-switched telephony services. We pay interconnect fees to other telephony and internet providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and receive similar fees from providers when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points. 
Our telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all of our markets in combination with one or more of our other services. Our telephony service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also offer value added services, such as a personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line at an incremental cost. 
Multiple Dwelling Units and Partner Networks
Almost two-thirds of Unitymedia’s video customers are in multiple dwelling units where Unitymedia has the billing relationship with the landlord or housing association or with a third-party (Professional Operator) that operates and administers the in-building network on behalf of housing associations. Many of these agreements allow Unitymedia to offer its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the end customer. Professional Operators may procure the basic video signals from Unitymedia at volume-based discounts and will generally resell them to housing associations with whom the operator maintains the customer relationship. Unitymedia has entered into agreements with Professional Operators, such as Tele Columbus Multimedia GmbH, that allow Unitymedia to market its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services directly to the Professional Operator’s subscriber base. 
Pursuant to an agreement executed on June 28, 2008 (the PICs Agreement) with four associations of municipalities in Belgium (the pure intercommunales or PICs), Telenet leases the PICs broadband communications network and, accordingly, makes its services available to all of the homes passed by the cable network owned by the PICs. Telenet has a direct customer relationship with the basic and enhanced video subscribers on the PICs network. Pursuant to the PICs Agreement, Telenet has full rights to use substantially all of the PICs network under a long-term capital lease. Unless extended, the PICs Agreement will expire on September 23, 2046, and cannot be terminated earlier (except in the case of non-payment or bankruptcy of Telenet). For additional information on the PICs Agreement, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For approximately two-thirds of the basic video subscribers in UPC Holding’s Switzerland operations (UPC Switzerland), UPC Switzerland maintains billing relationships with landlords or housing associations and provides basic video service to the tenants. The landlord or housing association administers the billing for the basic video service with their tenants and manages service terminations for their rental units. When tenants select triple-play bundles with or without mobile service from UPC Switzerland, they then migrate to a direct billing relationship with us.
UPC Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services directly to the video cable subscribers of those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with UPC Switzerland. UPC Switzerland has the direct customer billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting UPC Switzerland to offer some or all of its enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony products directly to those partner network subscribers, UPC Switzerland’s service operating contracts have expanded the addressable markets for UPC Switzerland’s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide digital products directly to the partner network subscribers, UPC Switzerland pays to the partner network a share of the revenue generated from those subscribers. UPC Switzerland also provides network maintenance services and engineering and construction services to its partner networks.

Business Services
In addition to our residential services, we offer business services in all of our European operations. For business and public sector organizations, we provide a range of voice, advanced data, video, wireless and cloud-based services, as well as mobile and converged fixed-mobile services. Our business customers include SOHO (generally up to five employees), small business and medium and large enterprises. We also provide business services on a wholesale basis to other operators. 
Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of our business customers with a wide range of services, including increased data transmission speeds and virtual private networks. These services fall into five broad categories: 

• | VoIP and circuit-switch telephony, hosted private branch exchange solutions and conferencing options;


• | data services for internet access, virtual private networks and high capacity point-to-point services;


• | wireless services for mobile voice and data, as well as managed WiFi networks;


• | video programming packages and select channel lineups for targeted industries; and


• | value added services, including webhosting, managed security systems and storage and cloud enabled software.

Our intermediate to long-term strategy is to enhance our capabilities and offerings in the business sector so we become a preferred provider in the business market. To execute this strategy, customer experience and strategic marketing play a key role.
Our business services are provided to customers at contractually established prices based on the size of the business, type of services received and the volume and duration of the service agreement. SOHO and small business customers pay business market prices on a monthly subscription basis to receive enhanced service levels and business features that support their needs. For more advanced business services, these customers generally enter into a service agreement. For medium to large business customers, we enter into individual agreements that address their needs. These agreements are generally for a period of at least one year. 
Investments—VodafoneZiggo
We own a 50% interest in VodafoneZiggo, which has a nationwide integrated broadband and mobile network in the Netherlands. In connection with the formation of VodafoneZiggo, we entered into a shareholders agreement with Vodafone providing for the governance of VodafoneZiggo, including decision-making process, information access, dividend policy and non-compete provisions. It also provides for restrictions on transfer of interests in VodafoneZiggo and exit arrangements. Under the dividend policy, VodafoneZiggo is required to distribute all unrestricted cash to Vodafone and us, subject to minimum cash requirements and financing arrangements. We also entered into a framework agreement with VodafoneZiggo to provide access to each partner’s expertise in the telecommunications business. For additional information on the above agreements, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The fiber-rich broadband network of VodafoneZiggo passes 7.1 million homes. VodafoneZiggo also offers nationwide mobile coverage. At December 31, 2016, VodafoneZiggo had nearly 14.8 million subscribers of which 4.0 million were video, 3.2 million were high-speed broadband, 2.5 million were fixed-line telephony and 5.1 million were mobile. In addition to its residential services, VodafoneZiggo offers extensive business services throughout the Netherlands. The operations of VodafoneZiggo are subject to various regulations, which are described below under Regulatory Matters--Europe--The Netherlands. 
VodafoneZiggo customers continue to have access to Ziggo Group Holding’s Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed as Ziggo TV), including Replay TV, 300 Mbps nationwide broadband internet and an extensive WiFi Community network. They also have access to Vodafone’s nationwide long-term evolution wireless service, also called “4G” (referred to herein as LTE) services, under either a prepaid or postpaid service plan. With its mobile services, VodafoneZiggo is able to offer its customers quad-play bundles and plans to market converged services in 2017 to residential and business customers.
Digital subscribers of VodafoneZiggo may subscribe to premium channels and VoD services, including catch-up television, on a subscription or transaction basis. Its premium channels include sports channels from Ziggo Sport Totaal. It also owns the Ziggo Sport channel, which is available exclusively to VodafoneZiggo customers. In addition to Horizon TV, VodafoneZiggo also offers its customers a cloud-based interactive television service using existing set-top boxes. By combining IP protocol with the standard set-top box, devices without built-in hardware functionality for interactivity can make use of interactive services through the VodafoneZiggo cable network. 
VodafoneZiggo offers multiple tiers of broadband internet service ranging from a basic service of 40 Mbps to an ultra high-speed internet service of either 150 Mbps or 300 Mbps. The speed of service depends on the tier of service selected. Its internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls. It also offers value-added broadband services, which include security (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and spam protection) and online storage solutions and web spaces. VodafoneZiggo
I-19

also offers mobile broadband services. Its customers have access to the Community WiFi in the Netherlands and in our European footprint.
VodafoneZiggo also offers multi-feature telephony services. This service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. In addition, value added services, such as a personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line, are available.
For all its services, VodafoneZiggo competes primarily with the provision of similar services from the incumbent telecommunications operator Koninklijke KPN N.V. (KPN). KPN offers (1) internet protocol television (IPTV) over fiber optic lines where the fiber is to the home, cabinet, or building or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is referred to herein as FTTx) networks and through broadband internet connections using DSL or very high-speed DSL technology (VDSL) or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (2) digital terrestrial television (DTT), and (3) LTE services. Where KPN has enhanced its VDSL system, it offers broadband internet with download speeds of 100 Mbps or 200 Mbps and on its FTTx networks, it offers download speeds of up to 500 Mbps. Its ability to offer a bundled triple-play of video, broadband internet and telephony services and fixed-mobile convergence services, creates significant competitive pressure on VodafoneZiggo’s operations, including the pricing and bundling of its video products. KPN’s video services include many of the interactive features VodafoneZiggo offers its subscribers and KPN is currently testing a new set-top box that is expected to enhance the video experience for its customers. In addition, KPN has its own over-the-top (OTT) video service. Portions of VodafoneZiggo’s network have been overbuilt by KPN’s and other providers’ FTTx networks and expansion of these networks is expected to continue.

__________________

(1) | Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH homes. Our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count home passed for DTH.


(2) | Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services, including video, internet and telephony services.


(3) | Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we count as RGUs, without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include EBU adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our Customer Relationship counts. For further information regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes to Tables below. Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Customer Relationships.


(4) | RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber (each as defined and described below). A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in our Chilean market subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video, DTH, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers, free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our December 31, 2016 RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.


(5) | Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes smart cards, or other integrated or virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. With the exception of RGUs that we count on an EBU basis, we count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs.


(6) | Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers that are not counted on an EBU basis are counted on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced video services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our Enhanced Video Subscribers.


(7) | DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast directly via a geosynchronous satellite.


(8) | Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections.


(9) | Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers.


(10) | Mobile Subscriber is an active SIM card in service rather than services provided. For example, if a Mobile Subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one Mobile Subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two Mobile Subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our Mobile Subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country.

Additional General Notes to Table:
Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other business services. Certain of our business service revenue is derived from SOHO subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. SOHO customers of CWC are not included in our 
I-22

respective RGU and customer counts as of December 31, 2016. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.
Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including residential multiple dwelling units and commercial establishments, such as bars, hotels and hospitals, in Chile and Puerto Rico. Our EBUs are generally calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely as a result of changes in rates. 
While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform, (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews. 
Subscriber information for acquired entities, including CWC, is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

LiLAC Group Products and Services
Our LiLAC Group has broadband operations predominately in Latin America and the Caribbean serving residential and business customers. Our sub-sea network, together with our fixed-line networks and mobile platforms, allow us to offer end-to-end communications to customers. In Puerto Rico, our network includes a fiber ring around the island that is over 400 miles long, which provides enhanced interconnectivity points to the island’s other local and international telecommunications companies. These communication networks enable us to offer business services and wholesale services throughout the Caribbean and in parts of Latin America. These networks also support our offers of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile in our residential markets. Our services are provided through VTR in Chile, Liberty Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico and CWC in the Caribbean and parts of Latin America and the Seychelles. The operations of CWC are provided through various consolidated subsidiaries, including the following subsidiaries where we own less than 100%: Cable & Wireless Panama, SA (a 49.0%-owned entity that owns most of our operations in Panama), the Bahamas Telecommunications Company Limited (a 49.0%-owned entity that owns all of our operations in the Bahamas), Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited (an 82.0%-owned entity that owns the majority of our operations in Jamaica) and Cable & Wireless Barbados Limited (an 81.1%-owned entity that owns the majority of our operations in Barbados). 
Residential Services
For our residential customers, we offer a comprehensive set of converged consumer mobile, fixed-line telephony, broadband and video services primarily across the Caribbean and Latin America regions as summarized in the table below:

We offer mobile services throughout most of our Latin America and Caribbean footprint and in the Seychelles. We are a mobile network provider in Panama and most of our Caribbean markets, including the Bahamas and Jamaica. As a mobile network provider, we are able to offer a full range of voice and data services, including value-added services such as SMS, mobile internet and email access. This also provides us with the basis to offer our customers extensive converged products where we also offer video, internet and fixed-line telephony giving customers connectivity in and out of the home. For these mobile services we hold spectrum licenses with terms ranging from 10 to 15 years. In Chile we provide mobile services as an MVNO where VTR leases a third-party's radio access network. This arrangement permits us to offer our customers in Chile mobile services without having to own and operate a cellular radio tower network. 
I-27

Subscribers to our mobile services pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is included with one of our other services or includes mobile data services via mobile phones, tablets or laptops. Our mobile services are available on a postpaid or prepaid basis with most customers purchasing a prepaid plan. We offer our customers the option to purchase mobile handsets with purchase terms typically related to whether the customer selects a prepaid or postpaid plan. Customers selecting a prepaid plan or service pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally do not enter into a minimum contract term. Customers subscribing to a postpaid plan generally enter into contracts ranging from 12 to 24 months. The long-term contracts are often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. For each SIM card, we typically charge a one-time activation fee to our prepaid customers. Calls within and out of network incur a separate charge if not covered within a prepaid plan or under a postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services include voice, SMS and internet access. 
CWC is the incumbent fixed-line telephony service provider in many of its Caribbean markets and in certain markets the sole fixed-line provider. CWC offers multi-feature telephony service over its various fixed networks, including cable, DSL, FTTx and copper networks. Depending on location, these services are provided via either circuit-switched telephony or VoIP technology. As the need arises, we are replacing obsolete switches with VoIP technology and older copper networks with modern fiber optics. In addition, we continue to develop and invest in new technologies that will enhance our customers’ experiences. These digital telephony services range from usage-based to unlimited international, local and domestic services. 
We offer video services in Chile, Puerto Rico, and in most of our CWC residential markets, including Panama, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and the Bahamas. To meet the demands of our customers, we have enhanced our video services with next generation, market leading digital television platforms that enable our customers to control when and where they watch their programming. These advanced services are delivered over our FTTx and hybrid fiber coaxial cable networks and include an advanced electronic programming guide, DVRs and VoD. In certain of our markets, customers can pause their programming even while the live broadcast is in progress. 
In most of our markets, customers have access to VoD, which offers thousands of movies and other video content, such as kids, documentaries, adult, sports and television series, as well as music channels. Our VoD service is available on a transaction basis with certain VoD content available only through premium packages for an additional monthly charge. Customers who subscribe to our video service receive a VoD enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. We tailor our VoD services to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming from local and international suppliers, such as ABC/Disney, A+E Networks, NBC/Universal, Discovery and Turner Broadcasting, among others. 
In Chile, we recently launched Horizon TV through an advanced, cloud-based platform. For customers who take Horizon TV, we offer over 20 apps for various online services (such as YouTube, social platforms and games). In several of our Caribbean markets, we offer a comprehensive internet streaming video service (marketed as “Flow ToGo”) that allows our video customers to stream over 50 real-time video channels anywhere they have a broadband connection in and out of the home and on multiple devices. A video streaming service is also available in Puerto Rico where our video customers can stream over 45 real-time video channels.
Our operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting with a basic video service. All digital video services are encrypted and require a set-top box provided by us. Subscribers to our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and generally receive at least 70 video channels, including a limited number of HD channels, and several digital and analog radio channels. This service includes VoD access and an electronic programming guide. We also offer a variety of premium channel packages, including HD channels, to meet the special interest of our subscribers. For an additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video and radio channels, including channels in the basic tier of service and additional HD channels. Digital subscribers may also subscribe to one or more packages of premium channels for an additional monthly charge. In markets where our analog service is available, subscribers to such video service typically receive fewer channels than subscribers to our basic video service, with the number of channels dependent on their location. Subscribers to our digital services also receive the channels available through our analog service. 
We tailor our video services in each country of operation based on the programing preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. Our channel offerings include general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, life styles, news, adult, children, ethnic and foreign channels. In all of our broadband operations, we continue to upgrade our systems to expand our digital services and encourage our analog subscribers to convert to a digital or premium digital service. Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundled service of at least any two of the following: video, internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile. In Chile, we do not bundle our mobile services due to regulatory constraints.
Our customers are increasingly using online communications. To support our customers’ expectations for seamless connectivity, we are expanding our networks to make ultrafast broadband available to more people. This includes investment in 
I-28

the convergence of our fixed and mobile data systems and making wireless systems available in the home. In 2016, we improved the connectivity of over 350,000 homes in Chile, Puerto Rico, Panama and other CWC markets through network extensions and upgrade projects. In 2017, we intend to improve connectivity to approximately 450,000 homes through network extensions and upgrades, including migrating customers from legacy copper networks to cable or fiber networks. In addition, in 2016, we deployed the Connect Box to our subscribers in Chile and Puerto Rico. Connect Box is a dedicated connectivity device that delivers superior in-home WiFi coverage. We plan to expand the availability of this WiFi and telephony gateway to our CWC markets beginning in 2017. 
The internet speeds we offer is one of our differentiators, as customers spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. As a result, we are continuing to invest in additional bandwidth and technologies to increase internet speeds throughout our Latin America and Caribbean footprint. In 2016, we increased the top tier internet speed for our customers in Chile to 160 Mbps and in Puerto Rico to 300 Mbps. In certain areas of Puerto Rico, download speeds of up to 400 Mbps are available. We also increased our broadband internet speeds in the CWC footprint following the deployment of FTTx in Barbados and upgrades to our networks in Panama and Jamaica. As stated above, we plan to continue the upgrade and expansion of our fixed networks so that we can deploy high-speed internet service to additional customers in the coming years.
Our residential subscribers access the internet via DSL over our fixed-line telephony networks or via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, including personal computers, or wirelessly via the Connect Box. In each of our markets, we offer multiple tiers of internet service. The speed of service depends on location and the tier of service selected by our subscriber. For example, our tiers of service range from 4 Mbps to 300 Mbps in Panama and from 20 Mbps to 100 Mbps in Jamaica and several of our other Caribbean markets. Higher speeds are available in certain other markets, including up to 1 Gbps in Barbados and in limited areas of Trinidad & Tobago. 
Our internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls with value-added services available for additional incremental charges. Our value-added services include security measures and online storage. Mobile broadband internet services are also available through our mobile services described above. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors.

Additional Business Information
Technology 
In most of our markets, our video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services are transmitted over a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. This network is composed primarily of national and regional fiber networks, which are connected to the home over the last few hundred meters by coaxial cable. In several of our Caribbean markets, these services are transmitted over a fixed network consisting of FTTx, DSL or copper lines. Approximately 98% of our network allows for two-way communications and is flexible enough to support our current services as well as new services. 
We closely monitor our network capacity and customer usage. Where necessary, we increase our capacity incrementally, for instance by splitting nodes in our cable network. We also continue to explore improvements to our services and new technologies that will enhance our customer’s connected entertainment experience. These actions include:

• | recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by:


◦ | increasing the number of nodes in our markets;


◦ | increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network to 1 GHz;


◦ | converting analog channels to digital;


◦ | bonding additional DOCSIS 3.0 channels;


◦ | deploying VDSL over our fixed telephony network;


◦ | replacing copper lines with modern optic fibers; and


◦ | using digital compression technologies.


• | freeing spectrum for high-speed internet, VoD and other services by encouraging customers to move from analog to digital services;


• | increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and multiplexing) to cloud storage systems;


• | enhancing our network to accommodate business services;


• | using wireless technologies to extend our services outside of the home;


• | offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smart phones and tablets;


• | expanding the availability of Horizon TV and related products and developing and introducing online media sharing and streaming or cloud-based video; and


• | testing new technologies.

As stated under General Development of Business—Expansion and Acquisitions above, we are expanding our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network through our Network Extension programs. For our mobile network operations in the Caribbean and Latin America, we are acquiring additional spectrum, enabling us to expand our LTE service in the region. In addition, we are seeking mobile service opportunities where we have established cable networks and expanding our fixed-line networks where we have a strong mobile offering. This will allow us to offer converged fixed-line and mobile services to our customers. 
We deliver high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our broadband network in our European markets and most of our Latin America and Caribbean markets. The cable networks of our operations in Europe are connected to our “Aorta” backbone. The Aorta backbone is recognized as a Tier 1 Carrier, which permits us to serve our customers through settlement free collaboration with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network. For our operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, we deliver our high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our various fixed networks, including cable, DSL, FTTx and copper networks. These networks are further connected via our sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable network that provide connectivity within and outside the region.
In support of our connectivity strategy, we are moving our customers into a gigabit society. A majority of our broadband networks are already capable of supporting the next generation of ultra high-speed internet service at gigabit speeds. To provide these speeds to our subscribers, we are launching our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 technology throughout our footprint. The launch of DOCSIS 3.1 technology will allow us to offer faster speeds, in-home WiFi and better services. Our Unitymedia operations have already demonstrated that download speeds of 2 Gbps can be achieved on our network. The new gateways and the continued upgrades to our network in the coming years will allow us to maximize high-speed connectivity over 
I-32

our broadband networks and deliver gigabit services in a cost-effective manner. It will also allow us to meet the expectations of our customers for high-speed internet access both in cities and rural areas of our footprint.  
Supply Sources
Content. With telecommunication companies increasingly offering similar services, content is one of the deciding factors for customers in selecting a video services provider. Therefore, in addition to providing services that allow our customers to view programming when and where they want, we are investing in content that customers want. Our content strategy is based on: 

• | proposition (exceeding our customers' entertainment desires and expectations);


• | product (delivering the best content available);


• | procurement (investment in the best brands, shows and sports); and


• | partnering (strategic alignment, acquisitions and growth opportunities).

We license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from content providers and third-party rights holders, including broadcasters and cable programming networks. For such licenses, we generally pay a monthly fee on a per channel or per subscriber basis, with minimum pay guarantees in certain cases. We generally enter into long-term programming licenses with volume discounts and marketing support. For on-demand programming and streaming services, we generally enter into shorter-term agreements. For our distribution agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for smart phones and tablets. 
In seeking licenses for content, our primary focus is on partnering with leading international providers, such as Disney, Time Warner (including HBO), Fox, the BBC and Discovery. We also seek to carry in each of our markets key public and private broadcasters and in some markets we acquire local premium programing through select relationships with companies such as Sky plc (Sky) (U.K., Ireland, Germany and Austria) and British Telecom (BT). For our VoD services, we license a variety of programming, including box sets of television series, movies, music, kids and documentaries. In addition, we have entered into a multi-year revenue sharing arrangement with Netflix Inc. (Netflix) to provide our customers with premium OTT services. The partnership will result in Netflix's content being available via set-top boxes to our video customers across all of our markets in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. The Netflix app is already available to our customers in the U.K., Ireland and Switzerland and we plan to deploy the service in the rest of our operations via Horizon TV over the course of 2017 and 2018. It is also available to VodafoneZiggo customers.
Exclusive content is another element of our content strategy. To support this approach, we are investing in content assets. We have invested in various content companies, including ITV plc, All3Media Ltd., LionsGate Entertainment, TV3 Group (Ireland) and De Vijver Media. We are also investing in sports, both as a broadcaster and as a rights owner. In addition, we operate the leading Caribbean sports network Flow Sports, which provides exclusive full coverage of the English Premier League and other leading sporting events. We have also launched our own exclusive sports channels, Play Sports in Belgium, and announced the launch of MySports in Switzerland in 2017. 
In addition, we are commissioning our own dramas. We created the Swiss sitcom Fassler-Kunz, the Swiss series Im Heimatland and the original Belgium series Chaussee d'Amour. In August 2016, we announced that we are teaming up with All3Media, which we own jointly with Discovery Communications, Inc., to co-produce four high-end drama series over the next two years. This exclusive content will be available on demand to our customers. 
Customer Premises Equipment. We purchase each type of customer premises equipment from a number of different suppliers with at least two or more suppliers providing our high-volume products. Customer premises equipment includes set-top boxes, modems, WiFi routers, DVRs, tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer. Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer our customers mobile services. 
Software Licenses. We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds, from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products require us to pay a per subscriber fee for software licenses and a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our TiVo service in the U.K., we have a partnership arrangement where TiVo is the exclusive provider of the user interface software for our next generation set-top boxes, which provides converged television and broadband internet capabilities, and we are the exclusive distributor of the TiVo services and technology in the U.K. For our mobile network operations and our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on usage of the services.
I-33

Access Arrangements. Through Unitymedia, we have entered into various long-term agreements with the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom), for the lease of cable duct space and hubs, as well as use of fiber optic transmission systems, towers and facility space. In addition, Unitymedia purchases a portion of the electricity required for the operation of its networks through Deutsche Telekom under such agreements. Unitymedia’s ability to offer its broadband communications services to customers is dependent on the agreements with Deutsche Telekom. These agreements are long-term and may only be terminated under certain limited exceptions. Any termination, however, would have a material adverse effect on the operations of Unitymedia. For information on a legal action that Unitymedia commenced against Deutsche Telekom in December 2012 regarding these agreements, see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For our mobile services provided through MVNO arrangements, we are dependent on third-party wireless network providers. Each of our MVNO operations has an agreement with such a provider to carry the mobile communications traffic of our customers. We seek to enter into medium to long-term arrangements for these services. Any termination of these arrangements could significantly impact our mobile services.
Competition
All of our businesses operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets. Technological advances and product innovations have increased and are likely to continue to increase giving customers several options for the provision of their telecommunications services. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication services that allow for seamless connectivity. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephony and mobile) is a key component of our strategy. In many of our markets, we compete with companies that provide fixed-mobile convergence bundles, as well as companies that are established in one or more communication products and services. Consequently, our businesses face significant competition. In all markets, we seek to differentiate our telecommunication services by focusing on customer service, competitive pricing and offering quality high-speed internet. In this section, we begin with an overview on the competitive nature of the video, broadband internet, and mobile and fixed-line telephony services in our markets, and then provide more detail on the competitive landscape in our more material markets.
Video Distribution
Our video services compete primarily with traditional free-to-air (FTA) broadcast television services, DTH satellite service providers and other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including incumbent telephony operations offering (1) DTH satellite services, (2) IPTV over broadband internet connections using asymmetric DSL or VDSL or an enhancement to VDSL  called "vectoring", (3) IPTV over FTTx networks, or (4) LTE Services. Many of these competitors have a national footprint and offer features, pricing and video services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer. In certain markets, we also compete with other cable providers who have overbuilt portions of our systems. 
OTT video content aggregators utilizing our or our competitors' high-speed internet connections are also a significant competitive factor as are other video service providers that overlap our service areas. The OTT video aggregators (such as HBO Go, Amazon Prime and Netflix) offer VoD service for television series and movies, catch-up television and linear channels from broadcasters. In some cases, these OTT services are provided free-of-charge. The content library of such services are offered on an unlimited basis for a monthly fee. Typically these services are available on multiple devices in and out of the home. To enhance our competitive position, we provide our subscribers with TV everywhere products and premium OTT video services through MyPrime or our arrangement with Netflix. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events. 
We believe that our deep-fiber access provides us with several competitive advantages. For instance, our cable networks allow us to concurrently deliver internet access, together with real-time television and VoD content, without impairing our high-speed internet service. In addition, our cable infrastructure allows us to provide triple-play bundled services of broadband internet, television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider or network. Where mobile is available, our mobile networks, together with our fixed fiber-rich networks, allow us to provide a comprehensive set of converged mobile and fixed-line services. Our capacity is designed to support peak consumer demand. In serving the business market, many aspects of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental costs given that business demand peaks at a time when consumer demand is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand. In response to the continued growth in OTT viewing, we have launched a number of innovative video services, including Horizon Go, MyPrime and Replay TV in our European markets, Play More in Belgium and Flow ToGo in several of the CWC markets, as well as access to Netflix content.
I-34

Our ability to continue to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content and services on acceptable terms and to have such content available on multiple devices and outside the home. Some competitors, such as Swisscom AG (Swisscom) in Switzerland, have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain sports programs, which limits the opportunities for other providers to offer such programs. Other competitors also have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for programs, but our operations have limited access to certain of such programming through select contracts with these companies, including Sky Deutschland AG, a subsidiary of Sky, in Germany and Austria and Sky and BT in the U.K. and Ireland. If exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on selecting a video service. 
Liberty Global Group
In the European countries in which we operate, our principal competition in the provision of video services is from traditional FTA broadcasters; DTH satellite providers in many markets, such as the U.K., Germany, Austria, Ireland, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where we compete with long-established satellite platforms; incumbent telecommunications providers using fiber technology; and cable operators where portions of our systems have been overbuilt. In addition, in Belgium we are experiencing competition on our own network as a result of the Belgian Regulatory Authorities granting third-party operators (including the incumbent telephony operator) access to cable operators’ networks. See Regulatory Matters—Liberty Global Group—Belgium. Mobile broadband has gained a noticeable share of subscribers, which is another competitive factor.
Similar to our technological advances to enhance our video services, our competitors are also improving their video platforms with next generation set-top boxes, TV everywhere products and other interactive services. Similarly, VDSL, which is either provided directly by the owner of the network or by a third-party, is a significant part of the competitive environment in many of our markets as are FTTx networks. In all of our European markets, competitive video services are offered by the incumbent telecommunications operator, whose video strategies include IPTV over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks and, in some cases, DTH and DTT. The ability of incumbent operators to offer the triple-play of video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services and, in most countries, a quad-play with mobile services, is exerting competitive pressure on our operations, including the pricing and bundling of our video products. In order to gain video market share, the incumbent operators and alternative service providers in a number of our larger European markets are pricing their DTT, VDSL or DTH video packages at a discount to the retail price of the comparable digital cable service and, in some cases, including DVRs as a standard feature.
Overall, we are experiencing increased convergence as customers look to receive all their media and communication services from one provider. In our largest European video markets, our key competitors for the the provision of converged services are: BT (U.K.), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Proximus NV/SA (Proximus) (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). Each of these competitors have extensive resources allowing them to offer competitively priced bundled services. As a result, our ability to offer triple-play or quad-play bundles and fixed-mobile convergence bundles is one of our key strategies to attract and retain customers. In each of these markets, we seek to distinguish ourselves through our multimedia gateway services, interactive services (such as Replay TV and MyPrime) and our download speeds. 
Portions of our European systems have been overbuilt by FTTx networks and other cable operations. These systems are a significant competitive factor primarily for our Central and Eastern Europe operations. Based on research of various telecommunication publications, including by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and internal estimates, parts of our Central and Eastern Europe operations are overbuilt by FTTx networks, including almost all of our operations in Romania. Other cable operators have also overbuilt approximately half of our cable networks in Hungary and Poland. Although we have extensive FTTx overbuild in Switzerland, connectivity to the FTTx network is not available at all locations. In addition, government and quasi-government entities in certain of the countries in which we operate in Europe continue to invest in FTTx networks, creating another source of competition. In order to achieve download speeds of up to 100 Mbps or greater for customers, incumbent telecommunications operators are adopting VDSL with vectoring and bonding technologies as a more cost efficient solution compared to FTTx initiatives. Our primary competitor in Germany, Deutsche Telekom, has implemented this technology in almost all of our footprint in Germany. Swisscom is also implementing vectoring in Switzerland. Vectoring is a transmission method that coordinates line signals to reduce crosstalk levels and improve performance. Bonding is a method of taking channels on either DSL or cable plant and bonding those channels together for a higher bandwidth throughput. 
In most of our Central and Eastern European markets, we face intense competition from DTH services. These DTH companies offer aggressively-priced packages of video content and in some cases offer triple-play packages. FTA broadcasters are also significant competitors in the Central and Eastern Europe markets. To stay competitive, UPC Holding’s DTH operations offer advanced services and functionality, including DVR and premium content, in most of our Central and Eastern European markets. It has also expanded these services to include a triple-play offer in Hungary. Our cable operations stay competitive by offering enhanced digital services, such as HD channel offerings, MyPrime, Horizon Go and expanded VoD services. These operations have also increased broadband internet speeds in their triple-play bundles ranging from up to 250 Mbps in Poland to up to 500 Mbps in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. Promotional discounts are available, particularly on bundled options. 
I-35

We compete on value by offering advanced digital services, such as DVR functionality, HD, VoD, catch-up television, Replay TV, multiscreen services and multimedia gateways. We also compete by accelerating the migration of our customers from analog to digital services, offering advanced digital features and attractive content packages, as well as bundled services, at reasonable prices. In each of the countries in which we operate, we also tailor our packages to include attractive channel offerings and offer recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty contracts. In addition, from time to time, we modify our digital channel offerings to improve the quality of our programming. Where mobile voice and data are available, we focus on our converged service offerings at attractive prices. In our other operations, we use the triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as other products where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services. We also continue to enhance our Horizon TV product to meet our customers desire to view programming anytime and anywhere, such as new applications and expanding its availability in our markets. 

• | Virgin Media. Virgin Media’s digital television services compete primarily with FTA television and with Sky, the primary pay satellite television provider. Sky offers competitively priced triple-play and quad-play services in the U.K. and Ireland. Other significant competitors are BT and TalkTalk Telecom Group plc (TalkTalk) in the U.K. and Eircom Limited in Ireland, each of which offer triple-play services, as well as IPTV video services. Each of these competitors have multimedia home gateways.

Sky owns the U.K. rights to various entertainment, sports and movie programming content and channels. Sky is both a principal competitor in the pay-television market and an important supplier of content to us. Various Sky channels, including Sky Sports, are available over Sky’s satellite system and our cable networks, as well as via Sky’s apps and online players and other television platforms, and some of the channels are available on BT and TalkTalk platforms. Virgin Media distributes several basic and premium video channels supplied by Sky. BT is also both a principal competitor and an important supplier of content to us. BT owns premium BT Sport channels, providing a range of sports content, including football (soccer) from the English Premier League and exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. The BT Sport channels are available on our cable network as well as our competitors’ networks. 
In this competitive market, Virgin Media is expanding its broadband network and recently launched its new 4K enabled Virgin Media V6 set-top box in the UK. In Ireland it offers Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed as Virgin TV). The on-line streaming service Virgin TV Anywhere is available throughout the Virgin Media footprint. In addition, Virgin Media’s ability to include mobile for its U.K. and Ireland customers for a low incremental fee creating a fixed-mobile convergence bundle is a key market offer. 

• | Unitymedia. Unitymedia’s primary competition is from FTA television received via satellite. Unitymedia’s primary competitor for pay TV services is the IPTV services over VDSL and FTTx and DTH of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom. Deutsche Telekom has announced plans to cover approximately 80% of German homes with its VDSL network by 2018. Within its VDSL footprint, Deutsche Telekom is implementing vectoring technology to enhance maximum broadband speeds to up to 100 Mbps from the current speeds of up to 50 Mbps. Deutsche Telekom further announced its ambition to implement super vectoring technology across all cable network areas by 2018, enhancing broadband speeds in these areas to up to 250 Mbps.

Deutsche Telekom offers competitively-priced bundles, including fixed-mobile convergence, and recently became more aggressive on price by launching double-play and triple-play promotional offers. In addition, Vodafone, also a competitor in Germany, bundles its IPTV service with its broadband offerings through Deutsche Telekom’s DSL network under a resell agreement making it a significant competitor in the double-play and triple-play market in our footprint. It also has expanded its bundle offers to include mobile products. These converged offerings may enable Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone to reduce churn and attract new customers.
Deutsche Telekom and Professional Operators compete with Unitymedia for housing association contracts. Professional Operators typically procure the broadcast signals they distribute from Unitymedia or from FTA television received via satellite. Certain Professional Operators may also use such opportunities to build their own distribution networks or to install their own head-ends for receiving satellite signals. 
To enhance its competitive position, Unitymedia offers Horizon TV and the Horizon family of products, including Horizon Go. It also makes mobile available creating converged bundles. Mobile customers receive a discount when they also subscribe to certain bundles. 

• | Telenet. Telenet’s principal competitor is Proximus, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which has interactive digital television, replay television, VoD and HD service as part of its video offer, as well as a remote access service. Proximus offers competitively-priced bundles, including fixed-mobile convergence. Its IPTV services are delivered over its DSL and VDSL networks. Also, Telenet and other Belgian cable operators must give alternative providers access to

I-36

their cable networks. Consequently, Telenet faces increased competition from other providers of video services who may be able to offer triple- and quad-play services. For more information, see Regulatory Matters—Liberty Global Group—Belgium. 
In order to compete effectively against alternative providers, Telenet leverages its extensive cable network, the broad acceptance of its basic cable television services and Yelo Play and its additional features, such as HD and DVR functionality, VoD offerings and its Play Sports channel. It is also using mobile services to drive its other products through its all-in-one converged offering “WIGO”. In addition, Telenet continues to enhance its Yelo Play app and programming, including extending its rights to the English Premier League through 2019 and the addition of other sports rights. Further, with its pending acquisition of certain broadband operations from Coditel Brabant sprl, Telenet will extend its services to additional parts of Belgium and Luxembourg. 

• | UPC Switzerland. Our main competitor in Switzerland is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which provides IPTV services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks. Swisscom offers VoD services, DVR and replay functionality and HD channels, as well as the functionality to allow remote access to its video services, and has exclusive rights to distribute certain sports programming. Swisscom’s internet speeds include up to 100 Mbps on its VDSL network and up to either 300 Mbps or 1 Gbps in areas served by its FTTx network. Swisscom continues to expand its FTTx network to Switzerland households in our footprint, as well as in our partner network footprints. It has built its fiber-to-the-home network in several cities in cooperation with municipality-owned utility companies and, where no cooperation agreement has been reached, Swisscom is building its own fiber-to-the-home network. With respect to subscribers on partner networks, UPC Switzerland competes with other service providers for the contracts to serve these subscribers.

To compete effectively in Switzerland, UPC Switzerland promotes Horizon TV and its family of products together with Replay TV and MyPrime, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming and viewing preferences. It also uses its high-speed internet of up to 200, 400 or 500 Mbps to promote its extended digital tier bundles.
LiLAC Group
In Latin America and the Caribbean, our primary competition in the provision of video services, depending on the market, is from traditional FTA broadcasters, DTH satellite providers, other pay television providers using fiber technology or cable operators whose networks overlap our systems. OTT viewing is also a significant competitive factor. To enhance our video offerings in this region, we are developing cloud-based, next generation user interfaces based on advanced technologies. This is demonstrated by our recent launch of Horizon TV in Chile and an advanced set-top box in most of CWC’s markets. Our competitors, however, are also improving their video services with interactive services and wireless connectivity. Many of our competitors offer competitively-priced packages of video content and, in some cases, offer double- and triple-play packages.
In this competitive environment, we enhance our offers with advanced digital services, such as DVR functionality, HD channels, VoD and multiscreen services. In addition, we offer attractive content packages tailored to the particular market and discounts for bundled services. To improve the quality of the programming in our packages, our operations periodically modify their digital channel offerings. Where mobile is available, we are focusing on our converged service offerings at attractive prices. We use these services, as well as bundles of our fixed-line services, as a means of driving video and other products where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services. 

• | VTR. VTR competes primarily with DTH service providers, including the incumbent Chilean telecommunications operator Compañia de Telecomunicaciones de Chile SA using the brand name Movistar (Movistar), Claro Chile S.A., a subsidiary of América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (Claro), and DIRECTV Latin America Holdings, Inc. (DirecTV). Movistar offers double-play and triple-play packages using DTH for video and DSL for internet and fixed-line telephony and offers mobile services. On a smaller scale, Movistar also offers IPTV services over FTTx networks in Chile. Claro offers triple-play packages using DTH and, in most major cities in Chile, through a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. It also offers mobile services. To a lesser extent, VTR also competes with video services offered by or over networks of fixed-line telecommunication providers using DSL technology. To compete effectively, VTR focuses on enhancing its subscribers viewing options in and out of the home. It offers VoD, catch-up television, DVR functionality, Horizon TV and a variety of premium channels. These services and its variety of bundled options, including internet and telephony, enhance VTR’s competitive position.


• | CWC. CWC competes with a variety of pay TV service providers in its various markets. Several of these competitors offer double-play and triple-play packages. Fixed-mobile convergence services are not yet a significant factor in most of CWC’s residential markets. In Panama, CWC competes primarily with Cable Onda S.A., which offers video, internet and fixed-line telephony over its cable network. The DTH services of Claro are also a competitive factor. In several of CWC’s other markets, including Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago and Barbados, we are the largest or one of the largest video

I-37

service providers. In these markets, CWC’s primary competition is from DTH providers, such as DirecTV, and operators of IPTV services over VDSL and FTTx, such as Digicel Group Ltd. (Digicel). To compete effectively, CWC invests in leading mobile and fixed networks, and in content, where the Premier League is a main attraction for Flow Sports.

• | Liberty Puerto Rico. Liberty Puerto Rico is the third largest provider of video services in Puerto Rico. Liberty Puerto Rico’s primary competition for video customers is from DTH satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network Corporation (Dish Network). Dish Network is an aggressive competitor, offering low introductory offers, free HD channels and, in its top tier packages, a multi-room DVR service for free. DirecTV is also a significant competitor offering similar programming in Puerto Rico compared to Dish Network. In order to compete, Liberty Puerto Rico focuses on offering video packages with attractive programming, including HD and Spanish language channels. It also offers a specialty video package of Spanish-only channels that is gaining popularity. In addition, Liberty Puerto Rico uses its bundled offers that include high-speed internet with download speeds of up to 300 Mbps to drive its video services.

Internet
With respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based ISPs, many of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet services using cable, DSL or FTTx networks and wireless broadband internet services. These competitors have a range of product offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive services, data and other non-video services offered to homes and businesses. With the demand for mobile internet services increasing, competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies is a competitive factor. In several of our markets, competitors offer high-speed mobile data via LTE wireless networks. In addition, other wireless technologies, such as WiFi, are available in almost all of our markets. In this intense competitive environment, speed and pricing are key drivers for customers. 
Our strategy is speed leadership. Our focus is on increasing the maximum speed of our connections as well as offering varying tiers of service, prices and a variety of bundled product offerings and a range of value added services. We update our bundles and packages on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our customers. Our top download internet speeds in Europe range from up to 200 Mbps to speeds of up to 500 Mbps available in Switzerland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. Our top download speeds for our Latin American and Caribbean operations generally range from up to 100 Mbps to speeds of up to 350 Mbps. In Barbados, we also have speeds of up to 1 Gbps available and in Anguilla, we have speeds of up to 480 Mbps. In many of our LiLAC Group markets, we offer the highest download speeds available via our cable and FTTx networks. The focus is on high-end internet products to safeguard our high-end customer base and allow us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the internet market. By fully utilizing the technical capabilities of DOCSIS 3.0 technology on our cable systems, we can compete with local FTTx initiatives and create a competitive advantage compared to DSL infrastructures and LTE initiatives on a national level. With the commercial deployment of our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 on our cable networks, we plan to further increase our high-speed internet offers. 
Liberty Global Group
Across Europe, our key competition in this product market is from the offering of broadband internet products using various DSL-based technologies by the incumbent phone companies and third parties. The introduction of cheaper and ever faster fixed-line broadband offerings is further increasing the competitive pressure in this market. Wireless broadband services, such as LTE, are also significant competitors using high-speed mobile networks. We are expanding our ultra high-speed services and increasing our download speeds. In most of our markets, we offer our internet service on a standalone basis or through bundled offerings that include video, fixed-line telephony and mobile services. Mobile data is also increasingly important and we are addressing this through our wide range of mobile products, including expanding our LTE service area and offering SIM-only mobile products, as well as expanding our Community WiFi network.

• | Virgin Media. In the U.K., we have a number of significant competitors in the market for broadband internet services, including fixed-line incumbent telecommunications providers. Of these broadband internet providers, BT is the largest, which provides broadband internet access services over its own VDSL network. BT has announced its intention to rollout ultrafast speeds of up to 300 Mbps to 500 Mbps by the end of 2020 to up to 10.0 million premises using G-fast technology, a DSL standard designed for local loops less than 250 meters. This technology is also expected to eventually support a rollout of 1 Gbps service.

Operators such as Sky and TalkTalk deploy their own network access equipment in BT exchanges via a process known as local loop unbundling (LLU). This allows an operator to reduce the recurring operating costs charged by BT by reducing the proportion of traffic that must travel directly over BT’s network. LLU deployment requires a substantial capital investment to implement and requires a large customer base to deliver a return on investment. In addition to the competition 
I-38

and pricing pressure in the broadband market arising from LLU, competition from mobile broadband developments, such as LTE mobile services and WiFi services, is significant. Mobile providers continue to gain market share from fixed-line providers. These providers offer a range of mobile services.

• | Unitymedia. In Germany, the competition for broadband internet services is particularly intense. For broadband internet access, DSL is the dominant technology and Deutsche Telekom is the primary provider. Other major competitors to our services are resellers of Deutsche Telekom’s DSL and VDSL services. We also face increased competition from mobile broadband operators, including Deutsche Telekom, and other network providers, many of which offer mobile services through LTE wireless systems and are increasing their coverage areas. Deutsche Telekom is upgrading its VDSL network with vectoring technology to increase its speeds to up to 100 Mbps. It plans to have 80% of German households connected to this network by 2018. With its (vectored) VDSL expansion plan, competition from Deutsche Telekom will increase.


• | Telenet. In the Flanders region of Belgium, Telenet is the leading provider of residential broadband internet services. Telenet’s primary competitor is the DSL service provider Proximus. Proximus is a well-established competitor offering quad-play bundles. Proximus’ DSL and VDSL service provide download speeds up to 100 Mbps. Mobile internet use is increasing as well. Similar to its video services, Telenet faces competition in the provision of internet services from other providers who have access to Telenet’s cable network. In this competitive market, Telenet is using its fixed-mobile converged offer “WIGO” to promote its internet and other services.


• | UPC Switzerland. In Switzerland, Swisscom is the largest provider of broadband internet services, and is our primary competitor. Swisscom internet customers have access to its basic video content free of charge through its internet portal. It is also expanding its FTTx network and rolling out G.fast technology. At year end 2016, it had 2.5 million new connections through these technologies. Swisscom offers download speeds ranging from 20 Mbps to up to 1 Gbps.

LiLAC Group
In several of our CWC markets, we are the incumbent phone company offering broadband internet products using various DSL-based technologies. In these markets and our other Latin American markets, our key competition for internet services is from cable and IPTV operators and mobile data service providers. Wireless broadband services are a significant competitor with their high-speed mobile networks. To compete effectively, we are expanding our LTE service areas and increasing our download speeds. In most of our markets, we offer our internet service through bundled offerings that include video and fixed-line telephony. We also offer a wide range of mobile products either on a prepaid or postpaid basis.

• | VTR. In Chile, VTR faces competition primarily from non-cable-based ISPs, such as Movistar, and from other cable-based providers, such as Claro. Competition is particularly intense with each of these companies offering competitively priced services, including bundled offers with ultra high-speed internet services. Mobile broadband competition is significant as well. Both Movistar and Claro have launched an LTE network for high-speed mobile data. To compete effectively, VTR is expanding its two-way coverage and offering attractive bundling with fixed-line telephony and digital video service. In response to the availability of mobile data in Chile, VTR offers our high-speed internet with download speeds of up to 160 Mbps.


• | CWC. CWC competes primarily with mobile broadband providers in the provision of internet services. Where CWC is the incumbent telecommunications provider, it also competes with cable operators, the largest of which is Cable Onda in Panama and Cable Bahamas in the Bahamas. To a lesser extent, CWC experiences competition from Digicel in certain of its markets. To distinguish itself from these competitors, CWC uses its bundled offers with video and telephony to promote its broadband internet services.


• | Liberty Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, Liberty Puerto Rico competes primarily with mobile broadband providers. Most of these providers, including the incumbent telecommunications company, offer these services over their LTE networks. To compete with mobile broadband, Liberty Puerto Rico offers its high-speed internet with download speeds of up to 300 Mbps. Liberty Puerto Rico also competes with the DSL services of Claro in providing fixed-line internet services.

Mobile and Telephony Services 
Consumers are increasingly moving to mobile services. In almost all of our Latin America and Caribbean markets we are either the leading or one of the leading mobile providers, except in Chile and certain other markets where we are a relatively new entrant in the provision of mobile services. In Belgium, we are one of the top three mobile providers and in the U.K., we are the fourth largest provider, in each case based on number of SIM cards. In our other European markets, however, we currently have minimal mobile presence. In the markets where we are one of the top mobile providers, we continue to seek additional bandwidth to deliver our wide range of services to our customers and increase our LTE services. Where we are a small mobile provider, we face significant competition from other mobile telephony providers, many of whom offer LTE services and are making significant advances in obtaining customers. In all of our markets competition is intense. We also offer various calling plans, such as unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. In addition, we use our bundled offers with our video and ultra high-speed internet services to gain mobile subscribers. Our ability to offer fixed-mobile convergence services is a key driver. In several of our markets we provide converged services, including mobile, fixed-line, broadband and video. We are also exploring opportunities to offer mobile services in our other markets and mobility applications to our other services. 
The market for fixed-line telephony services is mature in almost all of our markets. Changes in market share are driven by the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. In several of our CWC markets, we are the incumbent telecommunications provider with long established customer relationships. In our other markets, our fixed-line telephony services compete against the incumbent telecommunications operator in the applicable market. In these markets, the operators have substantially more experience in providing fixed-line telephony and mobile services, greater resources to devote to the provision of fixed-line telephony services and long-standing customer relationships. In all of our markets, we also compete with other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines. OTT telephony is also a competitive factor. In many countries, our businesses also face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers. 
Competition in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony markets is extremely competitive due to market trends, the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile telephony and the growth of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and other regulatory action, such as general price competition. Carrier pre-select allows the end user to choose the voice services of operators other than the incumbent while using the incumbent’s network. Our fixed-line telephony strategy is focused around value leadership, and we position our services as “anytime” or “any destination”. Our portfolio of calling plans include a variety of innovative calling options designed to meet the needs of our subscribers. In many of our markets, we provide product innovation, such as telephone apps that allow customers to make and receive calls from their fixed-line call packages on smart phones. In addition, we offer varying plans to meet customer needs and, similar to our mobile services, we use our telephony bundle options with our digital video and internet services to help promote our telephony services and flat rate offers are standard. 
Liberty Global Group
Across Europe, our fixed-line and mobile telephony businesses are generally small compared to the existing business of the incumbent telephone companies. The incumbent telecommunication companies remain our key competitors but mobile operators and other VoIP operators, including ISPs, offering service across broadband lines are also significant competitors in these markets. Generally, we expect telephony markets to remain extremely competitive. 
Due to the maturity of the telephony market, competition is particularly intense in all our markets with price often the deciding factor. To maintain or increase market share, we and our competitors focus on bundling telephony services with quality broadband offerings and other services. In each of our markets, we face competition with a dominant fixed-line telephony provider, most of which also have competitive mobile offers based on LTE services. In our largest markets, the key dominant telephony providers are BT (UK), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Proximus (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). These telephony competitors are also the largest mobile operators in these markets based on number of SIM cards, except in Germany where Telefonica O2 is the largest.
LiLAC Group
In our Latin American and Caribbean markets, competition in the telephony and mobile services markets is also intense. In Chile, VTR faces competition from the incumbent telecommunications operator, Movistar, and other telecommunications operators. Movistar has substantial experience in providing telephony services, resources to devote to the provision of telephony services and long-standing customer relationships. Price is a key factor as are bundles with quality services. We distinguish our services by delivering reliable market leading internet access speeds with attractive bundled offers.
I-40

Movistar, Claro and Entel PCS Telecommunications SA are the primary companies that offer mobile telephony in Chile. In mid-2015, WOM S.A. entered the mobile services market through its acquisition of the Nextel Chile network. WOM S.A. is exerting significant competitive pressure in the mobile market with its very aggressive price offer. Such pricing is driving down sales and increasing churn in the mobile market. As an MVNO, VTR offers its mobile services on a standalone basis. To attract and retain customers, VTR focuses on its triple-play customer base, offering them postpaid mobile accounts at an attractive price.
With respect to mobile services, we face competition from Digicel in most of our CWC residential markets and Movistar and Claro in Panama. In addition, in the Bahamas, where CWC had previously been the only provider of mobile services, competition has increased significantly due to the commercial launch of mobile services by a competitor during the fourth quarter of 2016. We also face competition in the provision of broadband services from Cable Onda in Panama, Digicel in our Caribbean markets and Cable Bahamas in the Bahamas. These companies all have competitive pricing on similar services and Digicel is also able to offer fixed-mobile convergence with its video, internet, mobile and telephony services. To attract and retain customers, CWC focuses on providing quality services and premium content, as well as converged services where customers can access content in and out-of-the home.
Regulatory Matters 
Overview
Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the European Union (E.U.).
Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and type of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.
Liberty Global Group
Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the U.K. are the Member States of the E.U. As such, these countries are required to harmonize certain of their laws with certain E.U. rules. In addition, other types of E.U. rules are directly enforceable in those countries without any implementation at the national level. Certain E.U. rules are also applicable across the European Economic Area, whose Member States are the E.U. Member States (excluding Croatia) as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. 
On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved, on an advisory basis, an exit from the E.U. commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the British government formally initiates a withdrawal process pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on Europe. The British government has indicated that it plans to trigger Article 50 and commence negotiations to determine the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U. by the end of March 2017. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people and capital between the U.K. and the E.U., undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U. or other nations (including the U.S.) as the U.K. pursues independent trade relations. The initial impact of the announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets, including in the prices of our shares, as well as significant currency fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against foreign currencies in which we conduct business, namely the British pound sterling and the euro. The effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In the broadcasting and communications sectors, there has been extensive E.U.-level legislative action. As a result, most of the markets in Europe in which our businesses operate have been significantly affected by the regulatory framework that has been developed by the E.U. Regulation in Switzerland, which is not a Member State of the E.U. and is not part of the European Economic Area, is discussed separately below, as well as regulation in certain Member States in which we face regulatory issues that may have a material impact on our business.
I-41

E.U. Communications Regulation
The body of E.U. law that deals with communications regulation consists of a variety of legal instruments and policies (collectively, the Regulatory Framework). The key elements of the Regulatory Framework are various legal measures and directives that require Member States to harmonize their laws, as well as certain other instruments and regulations that have direct effect without any specific adoption at the national level. 
The Regulatory Framework primarily seeks open communication services in markets within Europe. It harmonizes the rules within the E.U. for the establishment and operation of electronic communication networks, including cable television and traditional telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communication services, such as telephony, internet and, to some degree, television services. 
On December 18, 2009, the Official Journal of the E.U. published revisions to the Regulatory Framework. These revisions should have been transposed into the laws of the Member States before May 25, 2011, although in practice, this process is still ongoing in certain Member States. 
Certain key provisions included in the current Regulatory Framework (including additional revisions since adoption) are set forth below. This description is not intended to be a comprehensive description of all regulation in this area. 

• | Licensing and Exclusivity. The Regulatory Framework requires Member States to abolish exclusivities on communication networks and services in their territory and allow operators into their markets based on a simple registration. The Regulatory Framework sets forth an exhaustive list of conditions that may be imposed on communication networks and services. Possible obligations include, among other things, financial charges for universal service or for the costs of regulation, environmental requirements, data privacy and other consumer protection rules, “must carry” obligations, provision of customer information to law enforcement agencies and access obligations.


• | Significant Market Power. Certain of the obligations allowed by the Regulatory Framework apply only to operators or service providers with “Significant Market Power” (defined below) in a relevant market. For example, the provisions of the Access Directive allow the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) in E.U. Member States to mandate certain access obligations only for those operators and service providers that are deemed to have Significant Market Power. For purposes of the Regulatory Framework, an operator or service provider will be deemed to have Significant Market Power where, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position of significant economic strength affording it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and consumers.

As part of the implementation of certain provisions of the Regulatory Framework, each Member State’s NRA is required to analyze certain markets predefined by the E.U. Commission to determine if any operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. Initially starting with 18 predefined markets, the E.U. Commission has currently recommended that there be four such predefined markets, which are subject to periodic review. NRAs may, however, continue to maintain their analysis of some of the markets from the previous list or perform analysis of markets not listed in the recommendation, which requires the NRA to prove that additional requirements, the so called three-criteria test, are met.
NRAs might seek to define us as having Significant Market Power in any of these predefined markets or they may define and analyze additional markets. In the event that we are found to have Significant Market Power in any particular market, an NRA could impose certain conditions on us. Under the Regulatory Framework, the E.U. Commission has the power to veto a finding by an NRA of Significant Market Power (or the absence thereof), which power also applies with respect to market definition, in any market, regardless of whether it is a market predefined by the E.U. Commission or an additional market defined by an NRA. We have been found to have Significant Market Power in certain markets in which we operate and further findings of Significant Market Power are possible. In particular, we have been found to have Significant Market Power in the market for termination of calls on our network.

• | Video Services. The regulation of distribution, but not the content, of television services to the public is harmonized by the Regulatory Framework. Member States are allowed to impose on certain operators under their jurisdiction reasonable must carry obligations for the transmission of specified radio and television broadcast channels. Such obligations are required to be based on clearly defined general interest objectives, be proportionate and be transparent and subject to periodic review. We are subject to must carry regulations in all European markets in which we operate. Must carry regulations are significantly different among Member States. In some cases, these obligations go beyond what we believe is allowable under the Regulatory Framework. To date, however, the E.U. Commission has taken very limited steps to enforce E.U. law in this area, leaving must carry obligations intact in certain Member States. We do not expect the E.U. Commission or the Member States to curtail such obligations in the foreseeable future.

I-42


• | Net Neutrality/Traffic Management. In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted the regulation on the first E.U.-wide net neutrality regime. The regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States, permits the provision of specialized services, optimized for specific content and subjects operators to reasonable traffic management requirements. The regulation also abolishes roaming tariffs beginning in June 2017.

On August 30, 2016, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) issued guidelines for implementation of the regulation. Although the guidelines are non-binding, they represent the official base on which NRAs may interpret the regulation. 
Regarding roaming, in order to ensure a smooth transition of the abolition of roaming surcharges in 2017, the regulation provided for a transition period beginning April 2016. During the transition period, surcharges are not to exceed the regulated maximum wholesale charges. In a simultaneous legislative process the E.U. Commission is expected to review the regulation on wholesale roaming charges in the first quarter of 2017.
On May 6, 2015, the E.U. Commission published its Digital Single Market strategy document. The strategy is an aggregation of many different policy areas with the purpose of creating a digital single market to expand jobs and stimulate growth. The strategy includes policy review in the areas of E.U. communications regulation, broadcasting law, copyright reform and anti-competitive geo-blocking practices. 
On September 14, 2016, the E.U. Commission published a proposal for the European Electronic Communications Code, which would replace the Regulatory Framework. The proposal recognizes the need for greater incentives to boost private sector investment in very high capacity networks. The proposal maintains the key elements of the Regulatory Framework, notably market analysis with remedies only being imposed on operators with Significant Market Power. The proposal captures all types of services that are relevant to consumers, not only the traditional electronic communication services as captured under the Regulatory Framework but also OTT services. The proposal brings greater harmonization to the timetables for spectrum licensing and renewal that will encourage investment in mobile networks and will result in more advanced services. The adoption of the proposal for the European Electronic Communications Code and its implementation in to national laws by Member States is not expected before the third quarter of 2018.
Broadcasting Law
Although the distribution of video channels by a cable operator is within the scope of the Regulatory Framework, the activities of a broadcaster are harmonized by other elements of E.U. law, in particular the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS). Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception within an E.U. Member State must respect the laws of that Member State. Pursuant to AVMS, however, E.U. Member States are required to allow broadcast signals of broadcasters established in another E.U. Member State to be freely transmitted within their territory, so long as the broadcaster complies with the law of their home state. This is referred to as the country of origin principle. Under AVMS, the country of origin principle applies also to non-linear services, such as VoD. Accordingly, we should be able, if we so elect, to offer our own VoD services across the European Economic Area based on the regulation of the country of origin. As a result, we could structure our business to have a single regulatory regime for all of our VoD services offered in Europe. In addition, when we offer third-party VoD services on our network, it should be the business of the third-party, in its capacity as provider of the services, and not us as the local distributor, that is regulated in respect of these services. 
Although Member States were obligated to transpose the requirements of AVMS into national law, and this has generally been completed, the practical effect is still not clear. Uncertainty still remains about the proper treatment of VoD from a practical perspective. Thus, there can be no assurance that the requirements for VoD will operate in the manner described above in any individual Member State. As a result, we may face inconsistent and uncertain regulation of our VoD service in Europe.
 AVMS also establishes quotas for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made by European producers who are independent of broadcasters. 
As part of its Digital Single Market strategy, on May 25, 2016 the E.U. Commission published a proposal for the revision of the AVMS. The proposal maintains the key elements of AVMS - notably the country of origin principle and European works quota. The adoption of the proposal for the revision of the AVMS is expected in the second half of 2017. Once adopted, its implementation into national laws by Member States is proposed to take place no later than 12 months thereafter. 
Under the Digital Single Market strategy, in December 2015, the E.U. Commission published a proposal for a regulation addressing the portability of online audiovisual content services. Under the proposal, providers of online audiovisual content services must allow subscribers who are temporarily present in any E.U. Member State to access and use those services. The intention of the proposed regulation is for subscribers to be able to enjoy the same out-of-home service in another Member State. 
I-43

The adoption of the proposed regulation is not expected until the second half of 2017, and would become effective within 9 to12 months after adoption. 
Other European Level Regulation
In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our European operating companies must comply with both specific and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data retention and electronic commerce. In December 2015, the E.U. approved the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with respect to data protection and retention. The GDPR enhanced existing legal requirements through several new rules and includes stiff penalties for organizations that fail to comply. The GDPR will be directly applicable in all Member States commencing in 2018. In addition, following the adoption of the GDPR, the E.U. Commission published on January 11, 2017 a proposal for an e-Privacy regulation, replacing today’s e-Privacy Directive that regulates privacy related issues in the electronic communications sector. The adoption of this proposal is not expected before June 2018.
Our European operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition and on consumer protection, which are broadly harmonized at the E.U. level. For example, while our operating companies may offer their services in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted to make a subscription to one service, such as cable television, conditional upon a subscription to another service, such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the degree to which they may discount certain products included in the bundled packages. 
The E.U. Commission is imposing more mandatory requirements and encouraging voluntary solutions regarding energy consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been participating in discussions and studies regarding energy consumption with the E.U. Commission and with experts working on their behalf. In addition, we are working with suppliers of our digital set-top boxes to lower power consumption, as well as looking at possibilities through software to lower the power consumption of the existing fleet of digital set-top boxes. We also worked with a large group of companies to create a voluntary agreement on set-top box power consumption as an alternative to regulation, which has been formally recognized by the E.U. Commission. Nevertheless, legislation in this area may be adopted that could adversely affect the cost and/or the functionality of equipment we deploy to customers. 
Pursuant to a Regulation on standby power effective January 7, 2010 (the Standby Regulation), many devices are required to have either a low power standby mode or off mode, unless it is inappropriate to have either such mode on the device. For this purpose, our set-top boxes and certain other equipment are equipped with an off switch. Beginning in January 2013, the Standby Regulation imposed further requirements on power management on certain devices we purchase and/or develop. These devices, namely the Horizon TV set-top box and any future set-top boxes, must comply with such requirements, unless it can be argued such further requirements are inappropriate. These additional requirements have necessitated additional software developments for our equipment and reduces the functionality of our equipment, assuming the equipment’s default setting is maintained. 
Furthermore in August 2013, the E.U. Commission issued an amendment to the Standby Regulation called Networked Standby (No 801/2013), which became effective as of January 1, 2015, with the aim of regulating, among others, the maximum power consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called Networked Standby mode. These additional requirements may have an impact on our costs and the customer experience.
As part of the E.U.’s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, spectrum made available through the switch off of analog television has been approved for mobile broadband use beginning January 1, 2013. This spectrum, known as the “digital dividend”, is in the 700 - 862 MHz band. The terms under which this spectrum will become available will vary among the European countries in which we operate. Certain uses of this spectrum may interfere with services carried on our cable networks. If this occurs, we may need to: (1) avoid using certain frequencies on our cable networks for certain or all of our services, (2) make some changes to our networks, or (3) change the equipment that we deploy. In approving mobile broadband, however, the Radio Spectrum Policy Program states that the new mobile services must co-exist with existing services, such as cable and DTT, to avoid harmful interference. As a result, we are in ongoing discussions with relevant Member States and the E.U. Commission to be included in LTE mobile trials in order to develop mitigation techniques and to engage NRAs to launch regulatory dialog with equipment manufacturers and mobile operators to develop co-existing networks. We have also requested Member States and the E.U. Commission to prepare comprehensive national impact assessments when spectrum conditions are changed to ensure that the costs to prevent interference between the various services are balanced.

United Kingdom
In the U.K., the Regulatory Framework is implemented through (1) the Communications Act 2003, which regulates all forms of communications technology, whether used for telecommunications or broadcasting, and (2) the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006, which regulates radio communications in the U.K. (including spectrum, licensing arrangements, usage conditions and charges, license bidding and trading and enforcement and penalties). In addition, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, as amended, implemented E.U. Directive 2002/58, which regulates the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. 
Telecommunications companies in the U.K., including Virgin Media, are also subject to regulation under the U.K. Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 and other U.K. statutes and subordinate legislation, including the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002. The U.K. Office of Communications (Ofcom) regulates both linear and on-demand programming, which is derived from the E.U. Audiovisual Media Services Directive.
Ofcom is the key regulatory authority for the communications sector in which Virgin Media operates in the U.K. It is responsible for furthering the interests of citizens in relation to communications matters and furthering the interests of consumers in relevant markets where appropriate by promoting competition. From 2017, Ofcom will also assume the responsibilities of regulating the BBC, a role currently undertaken by the BBC Trust. The Competition and Markets Authority also has jurisdiction with respect to competition matters. 
Broadband Expansion. The U.K. government is attempting to drive the provision of super-fast broadband to at least 95% of the U.K. population by the end of 2017. To stimulate private investment in this endeavor, the U.K. government is using money from the publicly funded BBC license fee, under-spend from the Analogue TV Switch-Off Project and other sources of public investment. The state aid measure permitting this subsidy was renewed (and amended) in 2016 and is expected to result in up to an additional 1%-2% superfast coverage. 
In the 2016 Autumn Statement, the U.K. government announced proposals for further funding, and other measures, targeted at supporting market rollout of full fiber and 5G services. Proposed measures include public funding for the creation of a match-funded “full fiber deployment” fund (indicative £400.0 million), business rate relief for the deployment of new full fiber networks from 2017 and public funding for a strategic program of full fiber and 5G trials (indicative £740.0 million). Little detail has been provided to date, but the government issued, on December 29, 2016, a call for input, seeking suggestions on how best to stimulate full fiber deployments, including, where appropriate, with the use of public funds.
In November 2015, the U.K. government announced that everyone will, by 2020, have a legal right to request a broadband connection of at least 10 Mbps regardless of where they live. The government intends to achieve this by introducing a broadband Universal Service Obligation (USO). The USO is aimed, in particular, at addressing the final 5% of the population in the U.K. without access to a broadband connection of a reasonable speed. The Department for Culture, Media & Sport commissioned Ofcom to undertake a detailed analysis of the key factors that will help inform the design of the USO. A report was issued to the U.K. government to this end on December 16, 2016. The U.K. government is considering the Ofcom report and is expected to set out its decision on the final USO structure and adopt legislation to implement the necessary legislation, in 2017. 
Television and VoD Services. In the U.K., Virgin Media is required to hold individual licenses under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 for any television channels (including barker channels and any electronic programme guides), which Virgin Media owns or operates and for the provision of certain other services on its cable television platform, such as electronic program guides. These television licensable content service (TLCS) licenses are granted and administered by Ofcom. Under these licenses, each covered service must comply with a number of Ofcom codes, including the Broadcasting Code, and with all directions issued by Ofcom. Breach of any of the terms of a TLCS license may result in the imposition of fines on the license holder and, ultimately, the license being revoked.
As a provider of an on-demand program service (ODPS), Virgin Media must comply with a number of statutory obligations in relation to “editorial content” and notify Ofcom of its intention to provide an ODPS. Failure to notify Ofcom or comply with the relevant statutory obligations may result in the imposition of fines or, ultimately, the prohibition on providing an ODPS.
Following a review by Ofcom, Sky’s wholesale must offer obligation, which regulates terms of the wholesale supply of Sky Sports 1 and 2 in standard definition and HD, was removed. The removal of this obligation was appealed by BT and on December 21, 2016, the Competition Appeal Tribunal issued a judgment denying BT’s appeal. 
Strategic Review of Digital Communications. In March 2015, Ofcom launched a strategic review of U.K. digital communications. A discussion document was published in July 2015, inviting stakeholder comment and input. Key focus areas for Ofcom were stated to be: investment and innovation, delivering widespread availability of services; sustainable competition; 
I-45

empowering consumers; and, targeted regulation where necessary, deregulation elsewhere. Virgin Media responded to the discussion document emphasizing the importance of investment for competition, innovation and consumer interest. A key area of consideration is the future regulatory treatment of BT, in particular whether BT should be fully (structurally) separated, with the Openreach network division becoming a separate, independent company. Openreach is the operator of the backbone of Britain’s broadband internet network.
An “emerging thinking” document was published on February 25, 2016, setting out conclusions and Ofcom’s proposed policy position relating to a number of aspects of the U.K. regulatory regime. Key conclusions included: no structural separation of BT at the present time; an intention to improve quality of service across all providers; a requirement for BT to enhance its wholesale duct and pole access product; and an intention to advance further consumer protection measures. Later on July 26, 2016, Ofcom proposed a legal but not structural separation of Openreach. On November 29, 2016, Ofcom stated that it is proceeding with a formal notification to the E.U. Commission to require the legal separation of Openreach from BT. We expect this notification, preceded by a consultation, to be made in early 2017, unless Ofcom and BT otherwise reach agreement.
Regulation of Broadband Markets. In 2017, Ofcom will commence its next triennial review of the Fixed Access markets, including the Wholesale Local Access market (incorporating physical or passive network access via methods such as LLU and duct access) and the Wholesale Broadband Access market (virtual or active network access via methods such as provision of wholesale managed service products). A key area of focus will be the regulation of BT’s FTTx based wholesale products (specifically the pricing thereof) and improving the existing physical infrastructure access (allowing third parties access to BT’s duct and pole estate). To this end, on December 6, 2016, Ofcom issued a consultation on making the physical infrastructure access more effective.
Ofcom Review of Business Connectivity Markets. Ofcom concluded its latest review of the U.K. business connectivity markets (leased lines and dedicated business connections, among others) in the spring of 2016. Ofcom found BT held Significant Market Power in certain markets and proposed consequential regulatory remedies. These remedies included an obligation on BT to provide access to its dark fiber. BT, CityFibre and TalkTalk have appealed Ofcom’s decision. Virgin Media has intervened in the appeal. This matter remains ongoing and a hearing is expected in 2017.
Mobile Service. As an MVNO, Virgin Media is subject to E.U. regulations relating to retail prices for roaming services. These regulations: set limits on certain wholesale and retail tariffs for international mobile voice roaming, SMS tariffs and data roaming within the E.U.; provide for greater levels of transparency of retail pricing information; impose measures to guard against bill shock in respect of data roaming; and set maximum roaming rates within the E.U. A new regulation, effective June 2017, abolishes roaming tariffs in the E.U. (subject to addressing inconsistencies in underlying wholesale charges). Until then, roaming surcharges have been reduced significantly since April 2016.
Mobile termination charges applied by mobile network operators are regulated by Ofcom under a Significant Market Power charge control condition. Under Virgin Media’s MVNO agreement, these changes in mobile termination charges are passed on to Virgin Media. Ofcom has set mobile termination charges for the period of 2015-2018, with rates reducing to approximately half of their starting levels by the end of this period. As a result, Virgin Media has experienced a reduction in revenue from such charges, although with some off-setting reductions in cost.
Fixed voice termination. Virgin Media has been designated as a provider with Significant Market Power on fixed voice termination. As a result, the rates that it charges other providers for termination on its network are subject to regulation. This requires, amongst other things, the provision of termination on fair and reasonable terms, conditions and charges - which must be no higher than BT’s regulated charges, unless certain conditions are met.
Germany
Germany has incorporated the E.U. laws into national laws, although under the German legal system competency is split between the Federal State (telecommunication law) and the German federal states (Bundesländer) (media law). The German Telecommunications Act broadly implemented the Regulatory Framework and covers the distribution of any signal by telecommunications networks encompassing television signals, internet data and telephony. The 2009 revisions to the Regulatory Framework by the E.U. were implemented by Germany in May 2012. The German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) is responsible inter alia for the regulation of the German telecommunications market. The Federal Cartel Office (the FCO), the national competition authority (Bundeskartellamt), plays an important role with respect to infrastructure and media regulation. The FCO has powers to address competition issues in all markets, although in some cases, competition issues will be addressed by the German Federal Network Agency. 
Regulation of the media falls within the authority of the German federal states (Bundesländer). The media laws of all 16 federal states have been partially harmonized by the State Broadcasting Treaty (Rundfunkstaatsvertrag). The State Broadcasting Treaty establishes the main framework of the German regulation of broadcast. Nearly every German state has established its own 
I-46

independent regulatory body, the state media authority (Landesmedienanstalt) for the regulation of the private broadcasting sector. The state media authorities are primarily responsible for licensing and supervision of commercial broadcasters and the allocation of transmission capacities for radio and television channels. They also have authority with respect to the regulation of channel carriage fees, conditional access systems, interfaces, the bundling of programs and price regulation. 
The allocation and use of analog cable transmission capacities for both radio and television channels in Germany is governed by the must carry rules of the respective German federal states. The allocation of digital transmission capacities for digital television and radio channels is primarily governed by the must carry rules of the State Broadcasting Treaty. The media law in the states of Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse where Unitymedia operates, require Unitymedia to carry at least 13, 23 and 24 analog channels, respectively, and also limits Unitymedia’s ability to convert these analog cable channels into digital channels. 
The operation of conditional access systems for television services is governed by both the State Broadcasting Treaty and the German Telecommunications Act. Generally, operators must not unfairly obstruct or discriminate against broadcasters and other content providers through conditional access systems. 
Unitymedia has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on an individual fixed public telephone network.  Since November 2013, reciprocal termination rates for exchanging calls via Unitymedia’s IP-interface have been imposed, which results in Unitymedia, like every other telecommunications provider in Germany, charging the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Deutsche Telekom. The wholesale tariffs for call termination on the fixed public telephone networks is set at 0.0024 euro/minute, which rate expired on December 31, 2016. On December 7, 2016, the German Federal Network Agency published a draft decision regarding the wholesale tariffs for call termination on the public telephone network provided at a fixed location reducing such termination rates for Deutsche Telekom to 0.001 euro/minute effective January 1, 2017. Although Unitymedia is not regulated for interconnection via the SS7 interface, we expect the new level of termination rates will be applicable to Unitymedia in 2017 with respect to calls terminating on its NGN interface.
The Netherlands
The Netherlands’ electronic communications law broadly implements the Regulatory Framework. Pursuant to the electronic communications law, the Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM), the Netherlands NRA, performed a market analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In December 2011, ACM completed its analysis of the television market and concluded that there were no grounds for regulation of that market. As a result, no new regulations relating to the television market may be proposed without a new analysis. 
On August 5, 2013, ACM published its latest market analysis decision on call termination, which combines both the fixed termination market and the mobile termination market. The new tariffs became effective September 1, 2013. The decision was appealed by various operators, including Ziggo, and on August 27, 2013, the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court decided in a preliminary decision that the decrease of cap charges should be less steep than ACM had initially determined. These revised tariffs apply until the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court arrives at a final decision in the appeal proceedings on the merits. The Dutch Supreme Administrative Court ruled on October 15, 2014 to pose prejudicial questions to the European Court of Justice. After an Advocate General opinion, the European Court of Justice ruled on September 15, 2016 that deviation from the European Commission’s 2009 Recommendation on Termination Rates is only possible if justified by national circumstances. The hearing at the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court was held on January 11, 2017, and we expect the ruling in the next few months.
On January 1, 2014, the revised must carry obligations became effective. The revised must carry obligations do not only apply to cable operators, as was previously the case, but also apply to all providers of analog and digital program packages based on the principle of technology neutrality. Providers of digital program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers are subject to the obligation to provide at least 30 television channels, including six public television broadcasting channels as a must carry obligation, a limited amount of regional and local television broadcasting channels and a number of digital radio broadcasting channels. In addition, all providers of analog program packages with 100,000 or more subscribers must include at least 15 television channels, including five public broadcasting channels as a must carry obligation, a limited amount of regional and local television broadcasting channels and some analog radio broadcasting channels. The Dutch Media Authority can grant a (conditional) exemption from the obligation if the must carry obligations listed above give rise to disproportionate costs for the network operator, an impediment to innovation or other unreasonable outcomes. 
There is no regulated financing mechanism in place between network operators and broadcasters. Commercial and public program providers must negotiate with network operators regarding transmission fees. 
In July 2015, the Dutch incumbent telecommunications operator filed an appeal against the E.U. Commission regarding its decision to approve the acquisition of Ziggo, which we completed in November 2014. We are not a party to the appeal and we do 
I-47

not expect that the filing of this appeal to have any impact on the development of our operations in the Netherlands, including our contribution of Ziggo Group Holding and its subsidiaries to VodafoneZiggo.
Following the E.U. Commission’s clearance of our acquisition of Ziggo, on October 31, 2014, ACM published as part of the fourth round of market analysis a draft of market analysis decision on LLU. Initially, ACM found a risk of joint dominance by KPN and Ziggo in the related retail broadband market. Later, after notification to the E.U. Commission and further consultations, ACM published its final decision on December 17, 2015. In the final decision, ACM no longer found a risk of joint dominance for KPN and Ziggo at the retail level but still concluded that there is a risk of consumer harm due to prices being set above the competitive equilibrium. At the wholesale level, ACM concluded that KPN is dominant on the wholesale market and imposed obligations on KPN. ACM concluded that Ziggo is not part of the relevant LLU market and that KPN is dominant on that market. As a result, ACM imposed obligations on KPN only. ACM has indicated that as a result of the formation of VodafoneZiggo, it will start working on a new analysis of the LLU market in 2017. 
Belgium 
Belgium has broadly transposed the Regulatory Framework into law. According to the electronic communications law of June 13, 2005, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicate (the BIPT), the Belgian NRA, should perform a market analysis to determine which, if any, operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. In addition, the Federal Parliament prepared legislation to transpose the 2009 revisions to the Regulatory Framework, which became effective as of August 4, 2012. 
Telenet has been declared an operator with Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on an individual fixed public telephone network. Since April 1, 2012, reciprocal termination rates have been imposed, which results in Telenet charging the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Proximus. On August 30, 2016, the BIPT published its final decision regarding the wholesale tariffs for call termination on the public telephone network provided at a fixed location. As of November 1, 2016, the wholesale tariffs for call termination on the fixed public telephone networks is set at 0,092 eurocent/minute. This decision has been appealed before the Court of Appeal in Brussels by Proximus and 3StarsNet and a judgment is expected during the first half of 2017.
Although no determination has been made on whether Telenet as an MVNO has Significant Market Power on the market for call termination on individual mobile networks, its rates have been affected by rate limitations implemented by BIPT. In June 2010, BIPT imposed a steep rate reduction that resulted in (1) an initial 45% decline effective August 1, 2010, over the then average rate and (2) a further decline in January 2013 that was approximately 79% less than the average rate implemented on August 1, 2010. As of January 1, 2013, mobile termination rates have been set by BIPT at €1.08 cents per minute, and to date, 2015 rates have not been set. On September 14, 2015, BIPT published its draft decision on the relevant market for “call termination on individual mobile networks”. Telenet, as an MVNO, has been designated in the draft decision as having Significant Market Power. Following its acquisition of BASE, Telenet will be designated as having a Significant Market Power by BIPT. In the draft decision, BIPT adopts a bottom-up long run incremental cost model to calculate tariffs for call termination on individual mobile networks, resulting in a nominal value of €0.81 per minute in 2015 and a declining glide path up and until 2020. BIPT organized public consultation on this draft decision, which was open until November 14, 2015. This draft decision has not yet been submitted to the E.U. Commission for notification. A final decision is expected during the first half of 2017.
In December 2010, BIPT and the regional regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities) published their respective draft decisions reflecting the results of their joint analysis of the broadcasting market in Belgium. The Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted a final decision on July 1, 2011 (the July 2011 Decision) with some minor revisions. The regulatory obligations imposed by the July 2011 Decision include (1) an obligation to make a resale offer at “retail minus’’ of the cable analog package available to third-party operators (including Proximus), (2) an obligation to grant third-party operators (except Proximus) access to digital television platforms (including the basic digital video package) at “retail minus”, and (3) an obligation to make a resale offer at “retail minus’’ of broadband internet access available to beneficiaries of the digital television access obligation that wish to offer bundles of digital video and broadband internet services to their customers (except Proximus). 
In February 2012, Telenet submitted draft reference offers regarding the obligations described above, and the Belgium Regulatory Authorities published the final decision on September 9, 2013. Telenet has implemented the access obligations as described in its reference offers and, as of March 1, 2016, Orange Belgium NV (Orange Belgium), formerly known as Mobistar SA, launched a commercial offer combining a cable TV package and broadband internet access for certain of their mobile customers. In addition, as a result of the November 2014 decision by the Brussels Court of Appeal described below, on November 14, 2014, Proximus submitted a request to Telenet to commence access negotiations. Telenet contests this request and has asked the Belgium Regulatory Authorities to assess the reasonableness of the Proximus request. The timing for a decision regarding this assessment by the Belgium Regulatory Authorities is not known.
I-48

On December 14, 2015, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities published a draft decision, which amended previously-issued decisions, and sets forth the “retail minus” tariffs of minus 26% for basic television (basic analog and digital video package) and minus 18% for the bundle of basic television and broadband internet services during an initial two-year period. Following this two-year period, the tariffs would change to minus 15% and 7%, respectively. The draft decision was notified to the E.U. Commission and a final decision was adopted on February 19, 2016. A “retail minus” method of pricing involves a wholesale tariff calculated as the retail price for the offered service by Telenet, excluding value added tax (VAT) and copyrights, and further deducting the retail costs avoided by offering the wholesale service (such as costs for billing, franchise, consumer service, marketing and sales).
Telenet filed an appeal against the July 2011 Decision with the Brussels Court of Appeal. On November 12, 2014, the Brussels Court of Appeal rejected Telenet’s appeal and accepted Proximus’s claim that Proximus should be allowed access to Telenet’s, among other operators, digital television platform and the resale of bundles of digital video and broadband internet services. On November 30, 2015, Telenet filed an appeal of this decision with the Belgian Supreme Court. In 2014, Telenet and wireless operator Orange Belgium each filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeal against the initial retail minus decision. These appeals are still pending. On April 25, 2016, Telenet also filed an appeal with the Brussels Court of Appeals challenging the February 19, 2016 retail minus decision. There can be no certainty that Telenet’s appeals will be successful. 
The July 2011 Decision aims to, and in its application may, strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access to Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (1) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (2) adversely impact Telenet’s ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access ultimately afforded to Telenet’s network and other competitive factors or market developments. 
Switzerland
Switzerland has a regulatory system that partially reflects the principles of the E.U., but otherwise is distinct from the European regulatory system of telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act (Fernmeldegesetz) regulates, in general, the transmission of information, including the transmission of radio and television signals. Most aspects of the distribution of radio and television, however, are regulated under the Radio and Television Act (Bundesgesetz über Radio und Fernsehen). In addition, the Competition Act, the Date Protection Act and the Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications are potentially relevant to our business. With respect to energy consumption of electronic home devices, the Energy Act and the revised Energy Ordinance are applicable to set-top boxes as described below. 
Under the Telecommunications Act, any provider of telecommunication services needs to register with the Federal Office of Communications. Dominant providers have to grant access to third parties, including LLU access; however, it is restricted to the copper wire network of the incumbent, Swisscom. Therefore, such unbundling obligations do not apply to our business in Switzerland and other cable operators. Also, any dominant provider has to grant access to its ducts, subject to sufficient capacity being available in the relevant duct. At this time, only Swisscom has been determined to be dominant in this regard. Dominant operators are obliged to provide interconnection and all providers of services forming part of the universal service in Switzerland have to ensure interoperability of services.
In regards to call termination as part of interconnection agreements, Swisscom as market dominant provider, must offer these services at cost-oriented prices and disclose the conditions and prices for their individual access services. In interconnection agreements with Swisscom, reciprocal termination rates are imposed. The Federal Council has suggested that the current Telecommunications Act be revised. The Federal Council plans to introduce measures to allow for easier access to the incumbent’s network, better consumer protection (decreasing roaming fees, unbundling of products, measures to prevent spoofing) and a change to the regulatory regime giving the Federal Communications Commission partial ex officio rights to impose obligations on market dominant providers. Further, the Federal Council will implement consumer and youth protection measures. The topic of regulated net neutrality may be introduced in the revision. In addition, it is expected that the conditions for a national broadband rollout will be improved by introducing access obligations to the ducts of local utilities. The proposal is expected by September 2017, but would not be legally binding prior to 2020. 
Under the Radio and Television Act and the corresponding ordinance, cable network operators are obliged to distribute certain programs that contribute in a particular manner to media diversity. The Federal Government and the Federal Office of Communications can select up to 25 programs that have to be distributed without the cable operator being entitled to compensation. Since January 1, 2015, those programs must no longer be broadcasted in analog. 
I-49

Effective August 1, 2016, the Federal Council adapted its regulation on imposing power thresholds for set-top boxes to E.U.-levels. As a result, Switzerland will have the same power thresholds as member countries of the E.U.
In regards to lawful interception, the Federal Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications was finished in Swiss Parliament’s Spring Session 2016. Changes in the respective ordinance will be discussed in Parliament in Spring 2017. Relevant issues for us are automated information disclosure and identification of all clients by ID as this would mean mandatory changes of our ordering processes. 
In September 2016, the Intelligence Agencies Act was approved by the Swiss population. For Telecommunications service providers, the Intelligence Agencies Act contemplates new obligations regulating cable traffic. The respective ordinance containing details of the implementation will be under consultation during the first quarter of 2017. 
A revised version of the Data Protection Act is currently under public consultation until April 2017. The revised version foresees more transparency regarding the processing of data, for example by reinforcing the information duties when processing personal data. Furthermore, the new version follows the developments in the E.U.
LiLAC Group
CWC
The video, broadband and telephony services provided by CWC are subject to regulation and enforcement by various governmental entities in each of the jurisdictions such services are provided. The scope and reach of these regulations are distinct in each market. Generally, CWC provides services in accordance with licenses and concessions granted by national authorities pursuant to national telecommunication legislation and associated regulations. Certain of these regulatory requirements are summarized below. 
As the incumbent telecommunications provider in many of its jurisdictions, CWC is subject to significant regulatory oversight with respect to the provision of fixed-line and mobile telephony services. Generally, in these markets, CWC operates under a government issued license or concession that enables it to own and operate its telecommunication networks, including the establishment of wireless networks and the use of spectrum. These licenses and concessions are typically non-exclusive and have renewable multi-year terms that include competitive, qualitative and rate regulation. Licenses and concessions are scheduled to expire over the next two years in Jamaica, Cayman Islands and Barbados. 
Rate regulation of CWC’s telephony services typically includes price caps that set the maximum rates CWC may charge to customers, or legislation that requires consent from a regulator prior to any price increases. In addition, all regulators determine and set the rates that may be charged by all telephony operators, including CWC, for interconnect charges, access charges between operators for calls originating on one network that are completed through connections with one or more networks of other providers, and charges for network unbundling services. In addition, in certain markets, regulators set, or are seeking to set, mobile roaming rates. 
In recent years, a number of markets in which CWC operates have demonstrated an increased interest in regulating various aspects of broadband internet services due to the increasing importance and availability of high speed broadband. As broadband internet access has become a national priority for many of CWC’s markets, national regulators have demonstrated an increased focus on the issues of network resilience, broadband affordability and penetration, quality of services and consumer rights. Certain regulators are also seeking to mandate third-party access to CWC’s network infrastructure, including dark fibre and landing stations, as well as to regulate wholesale services and prices. 
As an example, the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL), the regulatory body for telecommunications in five Eastern Caribbean States (Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines), has adopted an Electronic Communications Bill that may have a material adverse impact on CWC’s operations in the ECTEL member states. The proposed Electronic Communications Bill includes provisions relating to:

• | net neutrality principles mandating equal access to all content and applications regardless of the source and without favoring, degrading, interrupting, intercepting, blocking access or throttling speeds;


• | subscription television rate regulation;


• | regulations implementing market dominance rules;


• | network unbundling at regulated rates; and

I-50


• | mandated unbundled access to all landing station network elements at cost-based rates.

We currently cannot determine the impact these provisions will have on our operations because national regulators are required to conduct extensive market reviews before adopting specific measures. Moreover, while we expect the legislation will be enacted during 2017, the bill will not become law in any individual ECTEL state until implementing legislation has been adopted by that state. As such, the timing and ultimate effect of the bill is unclear.
In Panama, as a result of a public consultation process, we expect the regulator to issue new guidelines for the Internet Public Service, establishing new quality goals for this service.
In addition to rate regulation, several markets in which CWC operates have imposed, or are considering imposing, regulation designed to further encourage competition, including introducing requirements related to unbundling, network access to third parties, and local number portability (LNP). LNP has been implemented in Panama, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica and is currently being contemplated or implemented in other jurisdictions, including Barbados, the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago. 
The pay television service provided in certain CWC markets is subject to, among other things, subscriber privacy regulations and must-carry and retransmission consent rights of broadcast stations. 
CWC is subject to universal service obligations in a number of markets. These obligations vary in specificity and extent, but they are generally related to ensuring widespread geographic coverage of networks and that the populations of CWC’s individual markets have access to basic telecommunication services at minimum quality standards. In a number of cases, CWC is required to support universal access/service goals through contributions to universal service funds or participate in universal service related projects. 
In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, CWC’s operating companies must comply with both specific and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data retention, consumer protection and electronic commerce. These operating companies are also subject to national level regulations on competition and on consumer protection.
The CWC Acquisition triggered regulatory approval requirements in certain jurisdictions in which CWC operates. The regulatory authorities in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Seychelles and the Cayman Islands, have not completed their review of the CWC Acquisition or granted their approval. While we expect to receive all outstanding approvals, such approvals may include binding conditions or requirements that could have an adverse impact on CWC’s operations and financial condition. 
In Trinidad and Tobago, CWC was required by Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT), in connection with TATT’s approval of CWC’s acquisition of Columbus International, to dispose of its 49% shareholding in the Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (TSTT). The disposal of CWC’s stake in TSTT is not complete and the deadline set by TATT for such completion has been extended until the end of March 2017. We may not be able to complete the sale of TSTT or realize the full value of TSTT from our divestiture due to the circumstances of the sale. The stake in TSTT is currently held for sale.    
Chile
VTR is subject to regulation and enforcement by various governmental entities in Chile including the Chilean Antitrust Authority, the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications (the Ministry) through the Chilean Undersecretary of Telecommunications (SubTel), the National Television Council (CNTV) and the National Consumer Service (Sernac).
In addition to the specific regulations described below, VTR is subject to certain regulatory conditions which were imposed by the Chilean Antitrust Authority in connection with VTR’s combination with Metrópolis Intercom SA in April 2005. These conditions are indefinite and include, among others, (1) prohibiting VTR and its control group from participating, directly or indirectly through a related person, in Chilean satellite or microwave television businesses, (2) prohibiting VTR from obtaining exclusive broadcast rights, except for specific events, and (3) requiring VTR to offer its broadband capacity for resale of internet services on a wholesale basis.
Video. The provision of pay television services requires a permit issued by the Ministry. Cable pay television permits are granted for an indefinite term and are non-exclusive. As such permits do not involve radio electric spectrum, they are granted without ongoing duties or royalties. VTR has permits to provide cable pay television services in the major cities, including Santiago, and in most of the medium-sized markets in Chile.

Cable television service providers in Chile are free to define the channels and content included in their services and are not required to carry any specific programming, except as described below. However, CNTV may impose sanctions on providers who are found to have run programming containing excessive violence, pornography or other objectionable content. Pay television operators are directly responsible for violation of such prohibitions. Additionally, the Television Act requires pay television operators to offer a certain quota of cultural content and to distribute public interest campaigns.
The Television Act establishes a retransmission consent regime between broadcast television concessionaires and pay television operators. This regime provides that once a broadcast operator achieves digital coverage of 85% of the population within its concession areas, the broadcast operator may require that pay television operators enter into an agreement for the retransmission of its digital signal. In addition, the Television Act requires that the technical or commercial conditions imposed by broadcast operators not discriminate among pay television operators. Also, the Television Act establishes a must carry regime requiring pay television operators to distribute up to four local broadcast television channels in each operating area. The channels that must be carried by any particular pay television operator are to be selected by CNTV. The full implementation of the retransmission and must carry regimes are still pending.
VTR’s ability to change its channel lineup is restricted by an agreement reached with Sernac in July 2012 and the general regulation established by SubTel in February 2014 (by the Telecommunication Services General Rulemaking). This framework allows VTR to change one or more channels from its lineup after a 60-day notice period to its subscribers. In such cases, VTR shall offer a channel of similar content and quality or a proportional compensation. Despite this, after certain channel adjustments were applied in July 2016, the excluded programmers as well as social media have questioned VTR’s ability to unilaterally modify its channel grid, arguing that content and quality of new channels should be identical to the excluded channels. A final position on this issue is pending.
Internet. A law on internet neutrality prohibits “arbitrary blockings” of legal content, applications or services and the provision of differentiated service conditions according to the origin or ownership of the content or service provided through the internet. Additionally, the law authorizes ISPs to take measures to ensure the privacy of their users and provide virus protection and safety processes over their network, as long as these measures do not infringe antitrust laws. Additional measures have been implemented, including obligations related to consumer information, traffic management policies, internet quality of service requirements and notices required by law concerning the effective maximum and minimum traffic speeds offered under internet access plans.
In order to protect the constitutional rights of privacy and safety of communications, ISPs are prohibited from undertaking surveillance measures over data content on their networks. Also, special summary proceedings have been created in order to safeguard intellectual property rights against violations committed through networks or digital systems. These proceedings include measures designed to withdraw, disqualify or block infringing content in the ISP’s network or systems. The law also provides for the right of intellectual property owners to judicially request from ISPs the delivery of necessary information to identify the provider of infringing content.
A bill is being discussed in the Congress, which would, if enacted, impose on fixed and mobile ISPs an obligation to guarantee a minimum broadband throughput based on the offered speed. The proposed bill would also require ISPs to provide its subscribers a certified measurement tool allowing them to verify this minimum service level and subject the ISPs to fines of penalties if the service level is not fulfilled. We expect this bill will be passed during the second quarter of 2017. 
Fixed-Line Telephony and Mobile Services. The provision of fixed-line telephony and mobile services requires a public telecommunications service concession. With respect to mobile services, in 2009, SubTel awarded VTR a license for 30 MHz of spectrum in the 1700/2100 MHz frequency band for the provision of wireless telephony services. The license has a 30-year renewable term. In 2012, VTR transferred this license to its affiliate VTR Wireless SpA (VTR Wireless), which is now a subsidiary of VTR known as VTR Comunicaciones SpA. On January 15, 2014, SubTel initiated a proceeding against VTR Wireless based on having allegedly “altered an essential element of its concession, particularly the type of service”. In this proceeding, SubTel asserted that VTR Wireless is not in compliance with the terms of such wireless license. SubTel alleged that the terms of the wireless license require VTR Wireless to comply with certain minimum network coverage and traffic levels. VTR disagreed with SubTel’s assertions regarding the terms of the wireless license and contested such assertions vigorously. The maximum possible sanctions include “the termination of the concession”. The final ruling regarding this case is still pending.
VTR has concessions to provide fixed-line telephony in most major and medium-sized markets in Chile. Telephony concessions are non-exclusive and have renewable 30-year terms. The original term of VTR’s fixed-line telephony concessions expires in November 2025. Long distance telephony services are considered intermediate telecommunications services and, as such, are also regulated by the Ministry. VTR has concessions to provide this service, which is non-exclusive, for a 30-year renewable term expiring in September 2025. 
I-52

There are no universal service obligations in Chile. However, local service concessionaires are obligated to provide telephony service to all customers that are within their service area or are willing to pay for an extension to receive service. All local service providers, including VTR, must give long distance telephony service providers equal access to their network connections at regulated prices and must interconnect with all other public service concessionaires whose systems are technically compatible. 
As a general rule, fixed-line telephony service providers are free to establish the rates directly charged to their customers, unless the Chilean Antitrust Authority concludes that due to a lack of sufficient competition in the market, rates should be fixed by SubTel. However, SubTel sets the maximum rates that may be charged by each operator for interconnect charges, access charges between operators for calls originating on one network that are completed through connections with one or more networks of other providers, and charges for network unbundling services. Rate regulation on interconnection charges is applicable to all fixed-line and mobile telephony companies, including VTR. The determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by operators for their fixed-line or mobile services are made on a case-by-case basis by SubTel and are effective for five years. The next VTR tariff setting is in process, which will define some of VTR’s tariffs from June 2017 to June 2022. 
Other Chilean Regulation

• | Price Increase. The Consumer Rights Protection Law contains provisions that require that any raise in rates exceeding inflation must be previously accepted and agreed to by subscribers. Although VTR disagrees with this interpretation, in July 2012, VTR reached an agreement with Sernac that permits VTR to make adjustments to its published prices twice per year to adjust for inflation, except those services that are subject to rate regulation. VTR is generally prohibited from increasing the rates over the inflation adjustment. VTR may, however, cancel a subscriber’s contract after 12 months and propose a new contract with new rate provisions. Once a year VTR may propose to its existing subscribers additional changes to their rates, which must be accepted by the subscriber for the rates to go into effect.


• | Bundling. On December 18, 2012, the Chilean Antitrust Authority issued its regulation governing the on-net/off-net pricing practice in the mobile industry and the offering of bundled telecommunication services. Pursuant to the terms of this regulation, as revised by the Chilean Supreme Court, mobile services may be sold jointly with fixed-line services. However, promotional discounts were not permitted for these double-play offers. As for traditional bundling over the same platform (e.g., bundled fixed-line services such as our double- and triple-play packages, or bundled mobile services), this regulation provides that such services may be bundled, subject to certain price limitations. These limitations require that the total price for a bundle must be greater than the standalone price for the most expensive service included in the bundle. Also, when three or more services are bundled, the price for the bundle must be greater than the sum of the standalone prices for each service in the bundle, excluding the lowest priced service.


• | Telecommunication Services Proposal. In February 2014, SubTel published a General Telecommunication Services Ruling that regulates the offer of telecommunication services, including voice, internet access, and pay television, either alone or in bundles, from a consumer protection point of view. The regulation introduced service billing, significant changes in contracts with customers, requirements regarding compensation in case of service failure, and rules regarding treatment of customers’ personal information.


• | Minimum Standards on Quality of Service and Operation. From August 5 to September 4, 2013, SubTel submitted for public comment a draft of the Technical Fundamental Plan on Maintenance and Public Service Telecommunications Network Managing. This draft seeks to impose minimum standards on quality of service and operation of telecommunications networks, in general, and in some particular services: voice services; text and multimedia messages services; data transmission services; minimum coverage for mobile services; and digital terrestrial television minimum coverage. We are uncertain when SubTel will publish the final version of the plan.


• | Consumer’s Rights Protection Law Amendment. A bill is being discussed at Congress assigning significant new powers to Sernac, including a material increase of fines and compensations. The current law acknowledges that legal regulations imposed on specific business activities (such as the Telecommunications Act) must prevail over the Consumer’s Rights Protection law. However, it is still uncertain how or whether Sernac and SubTel will redefine their respective scope.

Puerto Rico
We are subject to regulation in Puerto Rico by various governmental entities at the Puerto Rico and the U.S. federal level, including the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Puerto Rico Telecommunications Regulatory Board (TRB), which was established in 1996, has primary regulatory jurisdiction in Puerto Rico at the local level and is responsible for awarding franchises to cable operators for the provision of cable service in Puerto Rico and regulating cable television and telecommunications services.
I-53

Our business in Puerto Rico is subject to comprehensive regulation under the United States Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), which regulates communication, telecommunication and cable television services. The Communications Act also provides the general legal framework for, among other things, the provision of telephone services, services related to interconnection between telephone carriers, and television, radio, cable television and direct broadcast satellite services.
The FCC and/or the TRB have the authority to impose sanctions, including warnings, fines, license revocations and, in certain specific cases, termination of the franchise, although license revocation and franchise termination are rare. The Communications Act specifies causes for the termination of FCC licenses, including, for example, the failure to comply with license requirements and conditions or to pay fines or fees in a timely manner. Such sanctions by the TRB and/or FCC can be appealed to, and reviewed by, Puerto Rican courts and U.S. federal courts.
In Puerto Rico, antitrust regulation is governed by the U.S. Sherman Act, other federal antitrust legislation, and the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Law. In particular, the Sherman Act seeks to prevent anti-competitive practices in the marketplace and requires governmental review of certain business combinations, among other things. See note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Law substantially parallels the Sherman Act and authorizes the Puerto Rico Department of Justice to investigate and impose competition-related conditions on transactions.
Puerto Rico Law 5 of 1973, as amended, created the Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs, which regulates marketing campaigns, publicity, and breach of service contracts, and prohibits false advertising. The Puerto Rico Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Law 213), which created the TRB, requires that rates for telecommunication services be cost-based, forbids cross-subsidies and focuses on encouraging, preserving and enforcing competition in the cable and telecommunications markets. Although Law 213 does not require us to obtain any approval of rate increases for cable television or telecommunication services, any such increases must be in compliance with Law 213’s requirements, including prior notification to the TRB before such increases take effect.
The video, internet and fixed-line telephony services that we provide are all subject to regulation:

• | Video. The provision of cable television services requires a franchise issued by the TRB. Franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach or failure to comply with certain material provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing a franchisee’s system operations, although such terminations are rare. In addition, franchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the grant of authority. Franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms of up to ten years and must be periodically renewed.

Our pay television service is subject to, among other things, subscriber privacy regulations and must-carry and retransmission consent rights of broadcast stations. The Communications Act and FCC rules govern aspects of the carriage relationship between broadcast television stations and cable companies. To ensure that every qualifying local television station can be received in its local market without requiring a cable subscriber to switch between cable and off-air signals, the FCC allows every qualifying full-power television broadcast station to require that all local cable systems transmit that station’s primary digital channel to their subscribers within the station’s market (the “must-carry” rule) pursuant to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. Alternatively, a station may elect every three years to forego its must carry rights and seek a negotiated agreement to establish the terms of its carriage by a local cable system, referred to as retransmission consent.

• | Internet. We offer high-speed internet access throughout our entire footprint. In March 2015, the FCC issued an order classifying mass-market broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service”, changing its long-standing treatment of this offering as an “information service”, which the FCC traditionally has subjected to limited regulation. The rules adopted by the FCC prohibit, among other things, broadband providers from: (1) blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; (2) impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (3) favoring some lawful internet traffic over other lawful internet traffic in exchange for consideration. In addition, the FCC prohibited broadband providers from unreasonably interfering with users’ ability to access lawful content or use devices that do not harm the network, or with edge providers’ ability to disseminate their content. The FCC also imposed more detailed disclosure obligations on broadband providers than were previously in place, which were approved by the Office of Management and Budget in late 2015. The FCC’s rules are in effect, and were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The impact of these revised rules on our business is unclear.


• | Fixed-Line Telephony Services. We offer fixed-line telephony services, including both circuit-switched telephony and VoIP. Our circuit-switched telephony services are subject to FCC and local regulations regarding the quality and technical

I-54

aspects of service. All local telecommunications providers, including us, are obligated to provide telephony service to all customers within the service area, subject to certain exceptions under FCC regulations, and must give long distance telephony service providers equal access to their network. Under the Communications Act, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), like us, may require interconnection with the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC), and the ILEC must negotiate a reasonable and nondiscriminatory interconnection agreement with the CLEC. Such arrangement requires the ILEC to interconnect with the CLEC at any technically feasible point within the ILEC’s network, provide access to unbundled network elements of the ILEC’s network, offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunication services the ILEC provides to its own retail clients, and allow physical collocation of the CLEC’s equipment in the ILEC’s facilities to permit interconnection or access to unbundled network element services. Therefore, we have the right to interconnect with the incumbent local exchange carrier (PRT). We have negotiated an interconnection agreement with PRT, and the physical interconnection between both companies has been activated. 
All of our circuit-switched telephony and VoIP services are subject to a charge for the Federal Universal Service Fund (USF), which is a fund created under the Communications Act to subsidize telecommunication services in high-cost areas, to provide telecommunications services for low-income consumers, and to provide certain subsidies for schools, libraries and rural healthcare facilities. The FCC has redirected the focus of USF to support broadband deployment in high-cost areas. In addition, our circuit-switched telephony and VoIP services are subject to a charge for a local Puerto Rico Universal Service Fund, which was created by law to subsidize telecommunications services for low-income families under the Federal USF Lifeline and Link-Up programs.
The FCC has adopted other regulations for VoIP services, including the requirement that interconnected VoIP providers and facilities-based broadband internet access providers must comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires carriers to provide certain assistance to federal law enforcement authorities. VoIP providers are also required to offer basic and enhanced 911 emergency calling services, which requires disclosure to all VoIP customers. VoIP providers are also subject to federal customer proprietary network information rules related to customer privacy.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we, including our consolidated subsidiaries, had an aggregate of approximately 41,000 full-time equivalent employees, certain of whom belong to organized unions and works councils, and includes contractors and temporary employees. We believe that our employee relations are good.
