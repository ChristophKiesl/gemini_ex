Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule kinase inhibitors for difficult-to-treat, genomically defined cancers. Our mission is to expand the reach of targeted therapeutics by developing products that are designed to address significant unmet need. Our Kinnate Discovery Engine, which starts with the identification of an unmet need among validated oncogenic drivers, utilizes our deep expertise in medicinal chemistry and the tailored ecosystems of our partners to develop our targeted therapies. We focus our discovery and development efforts on three patient populations: (1) those with cancers that harbor known oncogenic drivers (gene alterations that cause cancers) with no currently available targeted therapies, (2) those with genomically well-characterized tumors that have intrinsic resistance to currently available treatments (non-responders), and (3) those whose tumors have acquired resistance over the course of therapy to currently available treatments. Our Kinnate Discovery Engine, together with the biomarker-driven approach of our drug development strategy and our continual translational research and early global expansion in development, may enable us to develop drugs with an increased probability of clinical success while reducing the cost and risk of drug development. Our most advanced product candidate is KIN-2787, which is a Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (RAF) inhibitor we are developing for the treatment of patients with lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors. Unlike currently available treatments that target only Class I B-Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (BRAF) kinase alterations, we have designed KIN-2787 to target Class II and Class III BRAF alterations, where it would be a first-line targeted therapy, in addition to covering Class I BRAF alterations. In April 2021, we filed an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for KIN-2787 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In May 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-2787 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-2787. We began dosing KIN-2787 in humans in the second half of 2021. Additionally, we are evaluating KIN-3248, a Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFR) inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a cancer of the bile ducts in the liver, and urothelial carcinoma (UC), a cancer of the bladder lining as well as other solid tumors. KIN-3248, is designed to address clinically observed kinase domain mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that drive resistance to current therapies. In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 in the first quarter of 2022. KIN-3248 has demonstrated proof of concept in preclinical models showing activity across both initial FGFR 2/3 genomic alterations and a broad range of common resistant variants that arise from first generation FGFR 2/3 targeted therapies. We are also advancing a number of other small molecule research programs, including a Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 12 (CDK12) inhibitor in our KIN004 program to target the treatment of ovarian carcinoma (OC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In May 2021, we announced the closing of a Series A preferred stock financing of $35mm of our China joint venture, Kinnjiu Biopharma Inc. (Kinnjiu), to enable the potential development and commercialization of certain targeted oncology product candidates across Greater China. We hold a majority stake of Kinnjiu. Kinnjiu expects to initiate a Phase 1 trial for KIN-2787 in Greater China in mid-2022.
 
In our in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies evaluating our RAF product candidate, KIN-2787, we observed kinase inhibition selectivity and a reduction in the size of tumors from KIN-2787 treated models of human cancer. In internal in vitro and in vivo head-to-head comparisons, we have seen improved kinase inhibition selectivity and pharmaceutical properties compared to a number of currently approved and in-development drugs. Importantly, KIN-2787 demonstrated inhibition of RAF dimer signaling while minimizing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway rebound, potentially resulting in a broad therapeutic index. In May 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-2787 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-2787. We began dosing KIN‑2787 in humans in the second half of 2021. Our first in human clinical trial, KN-8701, is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-2787 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors driven by specific classes of BRAF alterations, which are known oncogenic drivers, while also characterizing pharmacological and anti-cancer properties of KIN-2787. KN-8701 is currently in the dose escalation portion of the trial. We anticipate initial data from the Phase 1 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2022. KIN-2787 has also demonstrated preclinical proof of concept in Neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS) mutant melanoma models alone and in combination with binimetinib. Based on this preclinical proof of concept, in January 2022, we announced the addition of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma into our ongoing KN-8701 trial both in monotherapy and in combination with a MEK inhibitor binimetinib. We anticipate initiating the combination portion of the trial in the first half of 2022.
 
We are evaluating KIN-3248 for the treatment of patients with ICC and UC as well as other solid tumors. In preclinical studies, we have observed inhibitory activity across a broad range of clinically observed mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that drive resistance to current therapies. Because our preclinical studies demonstrated our candidates’ ability to cover the initial alterations and preemptively address these resistance mutations, we believe we may be able to meaningfully increase the duration of response (DoR) for certain patients by addressing these alterations. We plan to develop KIN-3248 initially for patients whose tumors have acquired resistance to therapies targeting FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations, which limits the durability of response. As with other precision oncology approaches, addressing resistance mutations may also ultimately enable us to develop a first-line therapy. In this program, we will primarily focus on cancers that are driven by alterations in FGFR2 and FGFR3. In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 in the first quarter of 2022. The Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-3248 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors driven by FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations, both initial driver alterations as well as resistance mutations. Further, the trial is also designed to characterize pharmacological and anti-cancer properties of KIN-3248.
 
Through the broad applicability of our Kinnate Discovery Engine, we are also advancing a number of other small molecule research programs, including a Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 12 (CDK12) inhibitor in our KIN004 program.
 


  
Precision medicine is predicated on the relationship between genomic alterations, protein dysfunctions and diseases, and aims to specifically and potently drug genomically validated target proteins (i.e., genomic variants potentially implicated in the biology of disease) while minimizing side effects. As genomic profiling of cancer patients becomes more commonplace, it is becoming increasingly clear that cancers developing in various sites throughout the body may share the same type of genomic alterations. As such, tumors may be identified and treated according to their distinctive genomic alterations, rather than focusing on simply the tissue of origin. Both research and clinical data suggest that some tumors, while having multiple identifiable genomic alterations, are primarily dependent on an aberrantly activated kinase for their proliferation and survival. Kinases, which are cellular enzymes that regulate the biological activity of proteins through a ubiquitous process known as phosphorylation, play a central role in the formation and metastatic spread of many cancers and therefore are the focus of our drug development efforts.
 
Kinase inhibition is a proven approach to fighting cancer, and for two decades, has addressed an increasing number of oncology indications. Kinases are enzymes that regulate the biological activity of proteins. Mutated kinases can result in deregulated activity that results in cancerous cell proliferation. Currently approved drugs that inhibit the activity of mutated oncogenic kinases (kinase inhibitors) have demonstrated significant clinical benefit to hundreds of thousands of cancer patients globally. The worldwide sales of small molecule kinase inhibitors in oncology were reported to be $23 billion in 2019 and are estimated to grow to more than $50 billion in 2024. However, because of the limitations of currently approved drugs, it is estimated that only 10% of all patients with advanced or metastatic cancer today are eligible for these treatments. This low penetration of targeted therapies demonstrates a substantial unmet patient need and market opportunity.
 
In the current RAF inhibitor landscape, no targeted therapies have been approved for Class II or Class III BRAF alteration-driven cancers. In the current FGFR inhibitor landscape, approved and clinical-phase FGFR inhibitors provide benefit, but the DoR of such inhibitors is limited due to acquired mutational resistance. Taken together, this represents a substantial opportunity for developing novel and potentially transformative drugs for underserved patient populations with difficult-to-treat, genomically defined cancers.
 
We believe our expertise and the foundational principles driving our Kinnate Discovery Engine and our focused drug development strategy offer an opportunity to identify and develop precision medicine solutions for populations that are currently underserved. Our Kinnate Discovery Engine encompasses:
 

1 | Identifying unmet need in validated oncogenic drivers. Our relationships with prominent academic centers provide insight into the drug targets that are validated oncogenic drivers, along with innate or acquired resistance and new patient populations that represent the unmet need. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2 | Deep Medicinal Chemistry Expertise. Through our internal expertise in structure based small molecule drug discovery and deep understanding of binding modes and biology, we identify compounds that have the potential to achieve a best-in-class product profile spanning alteration coverage including resistance mutations, selectivity, and pharmaceutical properties. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3 | Leveraging Tailored Ecosystem of Partners. We leverage an ecosystem of a number of commercial and academic partners to provide scale to our discovery efforts. For example, we have approximately 70 medicinal chemists at contract research organizations (CROs) working on our pipeline and a number of sponsored research agreements (SRAs) at prominent academic centers to advance the development of our targeted therapies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since our inception in 2018, our Kinnate Discovery Engine has led to two  product candidates in the clinic and multiple additional research programs with a continued goal to generate one IND a year. Our two advanced programs KIN-2787 and KIN-3248 were both derived from utilizing our Kinnate Discovery Engine. In May 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-2787 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial (KN‑8701) for KIN-2787. We began dosing KIN-2787 in humans in the second half of 2021. KN-8701 is currently in the dose escalation portion of the trial. We anticipate initial data from the ongoing KN-8701 trial in the third quarter of 2022. In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 in the first quarter of 2022.
 
Our Programs
 
We are currently focused on the development of small molecule kinase inhibitors for difficult-to-treat, genomically defined cancers.  Our Kinnate Discovery Engine, which starts with the identification of an unmet need among validated oncogenic drivers, utilizes our deep expertise in medicinal chemistry and the tailored ecosystems of our partners to develop our targeted therapies.  We aim to bring new treatment options to three patient populations: (1) those with cancers that harbor known oncogenic drivers (gene alterations that cause cancers) with no currently available targeted therapies, (2) those with genomically well-characterized tumors that have intrinsic resistance to currently available treatments (non-responders), and (3) those whose tumors have acquired resistance over the course of therapy to currently available treatments.
 
Our lead programs include candidates in clinical development for cancers that are driven by specific oncogenic alterations in kinase and related pathway genes including BRAF Class II and Class III, NRAS and FGFR2 and FGFR3. We are also advancing a number of other small molecule research programs, including a CDK12 inhibitor in lead optimization and several other undisclosed targets with compounds at the lead identification stage. We currently own worldwide development and commercial rights for all of our programs, with the exception of the Greater China rights for KIN-2787, KIN-3248 and our CDK12 inhibitor that are exclusively licensed to Kinnjiu, our majority-owned joint venture.
 


  
Kinnate’s Pipeline.
 


RAF Program: KIN-2787
 
In our most advanced program, we are developing KIN-2787, a small molecule kinase inhibitor targeting specific classes of BRAF kinase alterations (Class II and Class III BRAF alterations) that characterize subsets of lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors. No targeted therapies have currently been approved for Class II or Class III BRAF alteration-driven cancers, unlike the Class I BRAF alterations where three BRAF-targeted kinase inhibitor drugs have been approved by the FDA. Patients with cancers driven by Class II or Class III BRAF alterations have not responded to existing targeted therapies and have few treatment options currently available to them. Initially, we plan to develop KIN-2787 for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma subpopulations with Class II or Class III BRAF alterations that include specific BRAF point mutations (other than BRAF V600E), BRAF insertions/deletions (indels) and BRAF gene fusion events. In addition, we plan to develop KIN-2787 for treatment of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma, which is a RAF-dependent cancer, We believe KIN-2787 may provide substantial clinical benefit to these cancer patients who are inadequately served by current therapies.
 
In our in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies evaluating KIN-2787, we observed kinase inhibition selectivity and a reduction in the size of tumors from drug treated models of human cancer. In internal in vitro and in vivo head-to-head comparisons, we have seen improved kinase inhibition selectivity and pharmaceutical properties compared to a number of currently approved and in-development drugs. Importantly, KIN-2787 demonstrated inhibition of RAF dimer signaling while minimizing MAPK pathway rebound, potentially resulting in a broad therapeutic index. In May 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-2787 (KN-8701) upon FDA clearance of our IND. We began dosing KIN-2787 in humans in  the second half of 2021. KN-8701 is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-2787 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors driven by specific classes of BRAF alterations, which are known oncogenic drivers, while also characterizing pharmacological and anti-cancer properties of KIN-2787. KN-8701 is currently in the dose escalation portion of the trial. We anticipate initial data from KN-8701 trial in the third quarter of 2022. KIN-2787 has also demonstrated preclinical proof of concept in NRAS-mutant melanoma models as a single agent and in combination with binimetinib. Based on this preclinical proof of concept, in January 2022, we announced the addition of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma into our ongoing KN-8701 trial both in monotherapy and in combination with binimetinib. We anticipate initiating the combination portion of the trial in the first half of 2022.
 
FGFR Program: KIN-3248
 
We are developing KIN-3248, a small-molecule kinase inhibitor targeting cancer-associated alterations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes, which (together with BRAF alterations) are among the most commonly identified oncogenic drivers detected in solid tumor cancers. KIN-3248 aims to address the initial alteration and clinically-observed and predicted mutations in FGFR2 fusion gene-positive ICC and FGFR3-altered UC that drive resistance to current FGFR2- and FGFR3-targeted therapies. We believe this will translate to deeper, more sustained and more clinically impactful cancer responses than those observed with either of the two currently FDA-approved FGFR inhibitors, or other targeted drugs that, to our knowledge, are currently in development.
 


  
We are evaluating KIN-3248 for the treatment of patients with ICC and UC as well as other solid tumors. In preclinical studies, we have observed inhibitory activity across a broad range of clinically-relevant mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that drive resistance to current therapies. Because our preclinical studies demonstrated our candidates’ ability to cover the initial alterations and preemptively address these resistance mutations, we believe we may be able to meaningfully increase the DoR for certain patients by addressing these alterations. We plan to develop KIN-3248 initially for patients whose tumors have acquired resistance to therapies targeting FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations, which limits the durability of response. As with other precision oncology approaches, addressing resistance mutations may also ultimately enable us to develop a first-line therapy. In this program, we will primarily focus on cancers that are driven by alterations in FGFR2 and FGFR3. In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 in the first quarter of 2022. The phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-3248 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors driven by FGFR 2 or FGFR 3 alterations, both initial driver alterations as well as resistance mutations. Further, the trial is also designed to characterize pharmacological and anti-cancer properties of KIN-3248.
 
CDK12 Inhibitor Program (KIN004) and Other Research programs
 
Through the broad applicability of our Kinnate Discovery Engine, we are also advancing a number of other small molecule research programs, including a CDK12 inhibitor in our KIN004 program. CDK12 is an essential regulator of DDR genes for which no targeted therapies are currently approved or, to our knowledge, in clinical development. We expect to develop a CDK12 inhibitor candidate to target the treatment of OC, mCRPC and TNBC. CDK12 and our other small molecule research programs are aimed at addressing cancer cases not covered by existing targeted therapies.
Our Strategy
 
Our mission is to expand the reach of targeted therapeutics by developing products for underserved populations. The key elements of our strategy are to:
 

• | Rapidly advance the development of our lead targeted therapy RAF and FGFR candidates, KIN-2787 and KIN-3248 respectively. Our lead product candidates are designed to address clinically validated cancer targets in patient populations with limited treatment options. KIN-2787 is designed to address either Class II and Class III BRAF or NRAS alterations. KIN-3248 is designed to address FGFR2 and FGFR3 genomic alterations. We believe that these small molecule candidates offer the potential for substantial clinical benefit when administered as monotherapy. Additionally, because of their enhanced pharmacological properties, we believe there may be future opportunities for combination therapy development. In April 2021, we filed an IND application for KIN-2787 with the FDA. The FDA cleared our IND for KIN-2787 in May 2021 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial, KN-8701, for KIN-2787. We began dosing KIN-2787 in humans in the second half of 2021. KN-8701 is currently in the dose escalation portion of the trial. We anticipate initial data from KN-8701 trial in the third quarter of 2022. KIN-2787 has also demonstrated preclinical proof of concept in NRAS-mutant melanoma models as a single agent and in combination with binimetinib. Based on this preclinical proof of concept, in January 2022, we announced the addition of NRAS-mutant melanoma patients into our ongoing KN-8701 trial both in monotherapy and in combination with binimetinib. We anticipate initiating the combination portion of the trial in the first half of 2022. In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 in the first quarter of 2022. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we are successful in achieving clinically meaningful anti-cancer activity in specific solid tumor types, we expect to engage with regulatory authorities to discuss whether we may qualify for any of the FDA’s existing expedited regulatory approval pathways. Ultimately, the procedures and length of time that will be required to satisfy the FDA’s review and approval are outside of our control.
 

• | Develop a pipeline of product candidates focused on overcoming the limitations of current targeted oncology therapeutics. Currently, it is estimated that only 10% of all patients with advanced or metastatic cancer today are eligible for commercially available small molecule kinase inhibitors. Additionally, up to half of these patients may not respond to these treatments and up to half of those who do initially respond may develop resistance. Ultimately, it is estimated that only 2% to 3% of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer will have durable responses to currently available targeted therapeutics. We are therefore focused on developing drugs that can: 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Target known oncogenic drivers (e.g., Class II or Class III BRAF alterations) in selected cancer types that are not currently addressed by approved therapies. Our BRAF-targeting small molecule kinase inhibitors exemplify this strategy. The successful development and FDA approval of three BRAF-targeted kinase inhibitor drugs for use in Class I BRAF alterations establishes BRAF as a validated cancer drug target. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Overcome acquired resistance mutations to existing targeted therapies, potentially improving the durability of response. For example, in our FGFR program we seek to develop targeted therapies that cover initial genomic alterations and preemptively address acquired resistance mutations that arise with current targeted therapies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Treat non-responders to currently approved therapies where advancements in next generation sequencing have identified, and will continue to reveal, genomic drivers of intrinsic resistance. We expect to develop our CDK12 inhibitor and future programs that will target mechanisms of intrinsic resistance. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase our probability of clinical success by prioritizing known oncogenic drivers for development and incorporating biomarkers into preclinical and clinical development and exploring continual translational research. Typically, drug development carries high attrition rates from the preclinical stage through FDA approval, with some studies showing that only approximately 10% of the candidates entering Phase 1 trials are ultimately approved. We aim to improve the probability of clinical success through several approaches: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Targeting known oncogenic drivers. We attempt to select targets for drug development that behave as oncogenic drivers, which increases the likelihood of seeing objective measures of tumor responses early in clinical development. If we are successful in inhibiting these targets with our product candidates, we may increase the likelihood of achieving tumor responses. This approach has been successful for kinase inhibitors designed to treat patients with oncogenic alterations in lung cancer, melanoma, leukemia and other types of cancer. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Developing small molecule kinase inhibitors. Small molecule kinase inhibitors are a proven modality that has demonstrated success in the past with multiple currently approved drugs across many solid tumor and hematologic malignancy indications. By testing our molecules against in vitro and in vivo models utilized by prior approved drugs, we believe we can efficiently benchmark and optimize our compounds. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Incorporating biomarkers into our preclinical and clinical development. By evaluating a wide range of biomarkers in our preclinical studies and our human clinical trials, we can more rapidly determine patient populations that may or may not respond to our candidates. Continuing to use biomarkers in clinical trials allows us to potentially select defined patient populations that may demonstrate a stronger benefit and thereby ultimately increase our probability of success. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Continual translational research. Through extensive translational research starting from preclinical studies through clinical development, we can potentially identify new patient populations, responsive subsets and resistance mechanisms to our candidates. This also provides input into combination strategies we may explore with our candidates. Further, investment in molecular landscape collaborations can also help us refine the unmet need for our candidates and outcomes of existing therapies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While we are aiming to improve our probability of clinical success by utilizing these strategies, any drug development program carries potential safety liabilities and uncertainty and there is no guarantee that any of our candidates will obtain regulatory approval.
 

• | Leverage our existing relationships, collaborations and experience to efficiently develop and expand our product portfolio. Our team has extensive experience in identifying, discovering, developing and commercializing innovative cancer therapeutics. We are combining this broad oncology expertise with a network of collaborators to further develop our existing pipeline as well as to identify new research and development opportunities. We have established deep collaborations with leaders, with whom we have advisory agreements, at experienced precision medicine cancer centers and research institutions, including Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and University of California, San Francisco, with whom we have sponsored research agreements, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Moores Cancer Center at UCSD. These collaborations allow us to explore the mechanistic understanding of the biology of our targets and sensitivity and resistance to our molecules. We have also leveraged our relationships to build a network of global external partners to advance our pipeline. For example, we have service agreements with academic and industrial partners who contribute highly enabling technologies and services that include: (1) approximately 70 medicinal chemists at leading CROs that we can modulate utilization based on needs, (2) bioinformatics support for our translational research efforts, (3) crystallography and biophysical assay platforms to enable structure-based drug discovery, (4) biochemical and cell-based assays to guide lead generation and optimization, and (5) patient-derived organoid and xenograft models to translate our findings to the clinical setting. We utilize these collaborations and partnerships in many aspects of preclinical development for our pipeline of candidates and anticipate further utilizing them in our clinical development efforts. Additionally, these collaborations and partnerships may allow us to accelerate identification of new opportunities, including new patient populations we may target to understand emerging mechanisms of resistance. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the clinical impact and value of our portfolio. We retain global development and commercialization rights to our pipeline of candidates, either directly or through Kinnjiu, our majority-owned joint venture focused on Greater China. We intend to build an integrated biopharmaceutical company that will manage all aspects of product development and commercialization globally. We may seek to develop rational combination therapy strategies among products within our own portfolio, while also maximizing portfolio value through selective co-development and/or commercialization collaborations. Further, we are focused on expanding globally early in clinical development to accelerate enrollment in geographies with high unmet need. Through Kinnjiu we have the potential to accelerate enrollment of our programs through global trial recruitment as well as retain commercial rights to our programs in Greater China.

Our Kinnate Discovery Engine
 
The key elements of our strategy come together to form our Kinnate Discovery Engine, which seeks to leverage our team’s significant industry expertise to drive towards accelerated clinical development, regulatory review, and ultimately, potential new drug approval. We are led by a management team of precision oncology experts with decades of collective experience in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics who have held leadership positions at five of the top global oncology companies: Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Merck & Co., Novartis AG, and Pfizer Inc. This expertise extends to our established collaborations with leaders at experienced precision medicine cancer centers and research institutions.
 


We believe our expertise and the foundational principles driving our Kinnate Discovery Engine and our focused drug development strategy offer an opportunity to identify and develop precision medicine solutions for populations that are currently underserved. Our Kinnate Discovery Engine encompasses:
 

1 | Identifying unmet need in validated oncogenic drivers. Our relationships with prominent academic centers provide insight into the drug targets that are validated oncogenic drivers, along with innate or acquired resistance and new patient populations that represent the unmet need. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Deep Medicinal Chemistry Expertise. Through our internal expertise in structure based small molecule drug discover, deep understanding of binding modes and biology, we identify compounds that have the potential to achieve a best-in-class product profile spanning alteration coverage including resistance mutations, selectivity, and pharmaceutical properties. For example, the proprietary co-crystal structure of KIN-2787 in the BRAF protein developed by our team has demonstrated what we believe is a unique and highly selective BRAF inhibitor. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Leveraging Tailored Ecosystem of Partners. We leverage an ecosystem of a number of commercial and academic partners to provide scale to our discovery efforts. For example, we have approximately 70 medicinal chemists at contract research organizations (CROs) working on our pipeline and a number of sponsored research agreements (SRAs) at prominent academic centers to advance the development of our targeted therapies. Further, we leverage a range of relevant technologies such as bioinformatics, crystallography, organoid & xenograft models both for discovery and translational research. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Drug Development Strategy
 
Our drug development strategy begins with a biomarker-driven approach and is paired with continual translational research and early global expansion. We are focused on the oncogenic driver as the biomarker and enriching for patient populations with the highest likelihood of response. We believe in continued investment in translational research throughout drug development to help identify new patient populations, responsive subsets and resistance mechanisms. For example, our collaborations with leaders at experienced precision medicine cancer centers enable us to perform extensive cellular testing in Class II and Class III BRAF alterations, including BRAF fusions and indels, and in profiling compounds in FGFR2 fusion-driven cancer cells that mimic secondary resistance mutations found in specific populations of patients. Together, these translational research programs have allowed us to develop a deep understanding of specific pathways and accelerate the progression of our programs into seminal cellular screening and in vivo efficacy studies. We are focused on expanding our clinical trials globally early in development. We demonstrated this through the establishment of Kinnjiu in May 2021. We retain a majority stake of Kinnjiu. Through, Kinnjiu we have the potential to accelerate enrollment of our programs through global trial recruitment as well as retain commercial rights to our programs in Greater China.
Background and Limitation of Current Targeted Therapies
 
Background
 
Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases that share the commonality of abnormal cell growth and proliferation and enhanced cellular survival. This unregulated cell replication is driven by the progressive accumulation of mutations in, and dysregulated gene expression of, critical genes that ordinarily tightly regulate processes of cellular growth and metabolism, survival, proliferation and cellular lifespan.
 
Over the last several years, as genomic profiling of cancer patients has become more commonplace and genomic sequencing technology has undergone key advancements, it has become increasingly clear that cancers developing in various sites throughout the body may share the same genomic alterations. Further, when evaluated in controlled experimental systems, these cancer-associated genomic alterations (oncogenes) represent critical genomic drivers for which these cancers are dependent for their growth and survival, a concept referred to as oncogene addiction. The ultimate validation of an oncogene as a true driver gene to which the cancer is addicted is achieved when selected cancer patients whose tumors carry the mutated oncogene gain substantial clinical benefit from treatment with specific and potent drugs that target the oncogene in question.
 
Both research and clinical data suggest that some tumors, while having multiple identifiable genomic alterations, are primarily dependent on an aberrantly activated kinase for their proliferation and survival. Kinases, which are cellular enzymes that regulate the biological activity of proteins through a ubiquitous process known as phosphorylation, represent one of the largest classes of oncogenic drivers when aberrantly mutated or expressed in the cell. Kinase inhibition is a proven approach to fighting cancer and for nearly two decades has addressed an increasing number of oncology indications. Kinases represent the largest class of oncogenic drivers for which many targeted therapy cancer drugs have been successfully developed. Currently approved kinase inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefit to hundreds of thousands of cancer patients globally. It has been shown that patients with tumors driven by oncogenic kinases can demonstrate rapid and measurable tumor shrinkage when treated with the corresponding kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, while therapeutic benefit can often be significant and durable, tolerability is also frequently improved compared to conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapies. An example of this benefit has been seen when an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor is administered to a lung cancer patient with a tumor-bearing activating EGFR kinase mutation. In many cases, such clinical responses and increases in patient tolerability can be dramatic enough to support expedited regulatory approval and commercialization of these targeted therapies. The worldwide sales of small molecule kinase inhibitors in oncology were reported to be $23 billion in 2019 and are estimated to grow to more than $50 billion in 2024.
 
However, despite the advancement of precision medicine in oncology, a significant unmet need remains for the majority of cancer patients for whom no genomically targeted therapies exist or for which a resistance to targeted treatments has evolved. As depicted in the figure below, we estimate that currently only 10% of all patients with advanced or metastatic cancer are eligible for targeted therapeutics, where a defined genomic driver is matched with a currently approved targeted therapy. Of those patients, up to 50% (5% of all patients) will respond to the therapy (the responders), while the remainder gain no clinical benefit due to intrinsic resistance (the non-responders). Furthermore, among the responders, the majority (conservatively estimated at 50% to 80%) will eventually develop acquired resistance, lose their beneficial response to the therapy and experience disease progression despite continued treatment with the targeted therapy. Therefore, it is estimated that only 2% to 3% of current patients with advanced or metastatic cancer will have durable responses to currently available targeted therapeutics.
 


  
 
Limitations of Current Targeted Therapies
 
RAF Inhibitors
 
RAF kinases are a family of proteins that are involved in growth signaling, and include ARAF, BRAF and CRAF. BRAF alterations, which increase signaling, are divided into three classes: alterations where BRAF signals as a monomer (Class I), as a dimer of BRAF molecules (Class II) and as a dimer of BRAF and CRAF molecules (Class III). BRAF alterations occur in approximately 6% of all human cancers but there are only three BRAF targeted kinase inhibitor drugs currently approved by the FDA for use in Class I BRAF mutation-driven cancers: Tafinlar (dabrafenib), Zelboraf (vemurafenib) and Braftovi (encorafenib) are used in mutated melanomas, Tafinlar (dabrafenib) is also used in mutated NSCLC and anaplastic thyroid cancer, and Braftovi (encorafenib) is also used in mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). Class I BRAF alterations activate the BRAF kinase as a monomer, an individual protein molecule, not depending on dimerization, which is the binding of two protein molecules, for increased kinase activity. These inhibitors produce objective responses in approximately 50% of melanoma patients, meaning approximately 50% of patients are non-responders. An even higher percentage of CRC, NSCLC and thyroid cancer patients are non-responders. Class II and Class III BRAF alterations drive many cancers, but have been historically more challenging to target. In collaboration with Guardant Health we conducted a genomic landscape study of patients that had BRAF alterations. Among the nearly 6,000 patients who were identified as having BRAF alteration-positive cancers, approximately 55% were found to be harboring Class II and III alterations in over 25 common adult solid tumors, including NSCLC, melanoma, CRC, prostate cancer and breast cancer. Therefore, a significant unmet medical need remains to develop new drugs that can effectively treat cancers driven by Class II and Class III BRAF alterations. Further, in another collaborative study with Tempus Labs looking at over 55,000 patients with tumor biopsies it was determined that patients with NSCLC and Class II or Class III alterations experienced shorter time to treatment discontinuation in first line and second line of therapy compared to patients with NSCLC and BRAF Class I alterations which is suggestive of inferior treatment outcomes.
 
FGFR Inhibitors
 
Genomic alterations in the FGFR gene family occur in approximately 7% of human cancers. Approximately 30% to 35% of patients with UC and ICC whose tumors are driven by FGFR-dependent driver genes will respond to the three currently approved FGFR-targeting drugs, Balversa (erdafitinib),Pemazyre (pemigatinib) and QED Therapeutics, Inc.’s Truseltiq (infigratinib). Of the responding patients, the majority only demonstrate partial responses (i.e., partial tumor shrinkage) and the median DoR is only five months for Balversa (erdafitinib) and nine months for Pemazyre (pemigatinib), presenting a substantial need to develop potent and selective next-generation FGFR-targeting agents that can drive deeper responses and longer lasting clinical benefit among responding patients.
 
Most recently, the emergence of mutational resistance in FGFR driver genes in 67% of drug-treated ICC patients who received clinical benefit from an FGFR inhibitor has highlighted the limitation of both currently approved FGFR-targeting drugs and other clinical stage compounds. While this acquired mutational resistance in FGFR serves to further validate FGFR driver genes as drug targets, it also highlights both the need and the opportunity to develop potent, selective and specific FGFR-targeting agents which target existing mutational resistance and prevent emergence of new resistance mutations.
 
Our Approach
 
We employ a consistent, systematic approach to identify kinases that drive difficult-to-treat, genomically defined cancers. Through this approach, we aim to develop kinase inhibitor product candidates with therapeutic windows that provide durable and meaningful clinical responses to benefit patients in three patient populations:

• | those with cancers that harbor known oncogenic drivers with no currently available targeted therapies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | those with genomically well-characterized tumors that have intrinsic resistance to currently available treatments (non-responders); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | those whose tumors have acquired resistance over the course of therapy to currently available treatments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
By focusing on these three well-characterized patient populations, we believe that we will have a more efficient development path with potentially improved response rates in such populations. Due to advancements in genomic profiling and collaborations with leaders at experienced precision medicine cancer centers and research institutions, we have established and continue to develop a deep expertise and understanding of specific oncogenic drivers. Our collaborations allow us to:
 

• | define emerging patient populations;
--+-------------------------------------


• | demonstrate selective in vitro and in vivo activity and define dose-exposure pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships in clinically relevant models;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | test prioritized compounds against specific mutations and fusions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | investigate mechanism of action-the specific biochemical interaction through which a drug substance produces its pharmacological effect-to support the refinement of strategies for patient selection and patient stratification for both monotherapy and rationale combinations; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | develop biomarker-based development strategies that will drive patient selection in our clinical programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The combination of these defined patient populations, our deep understanding of oncogenic drivers and our Kinnate Discovery Engine allows us to target known kinases that have previously been difficult to inhibit selectively and also to identify, characterize and develop product candidates for novel kinase targets with clearly validated paths to early clinical signals.
 
Our Programs
 
Our programs include small molecule inhibitors targeting specific classes of BRAF kinase alterations (Class II and Class III BRAF alterations) and RAF-dependent cancers, and specific alterations of FGFR2 and FGFR3 that aim to overcome the genomic resistance commonly limiting the efficacy of existing therapies. We are also advancing a number of other small molecule research programs, including a CDK12 inhibitor.
Our RAF Program: KIN-2787
 
Overview
 
Our most advanced product candidate is KIN-2787, which is a RAF inhibitor we are developing for the treatment of patients with lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors. Unlike currently available treatments that target only Class I BRAF kinase mutations, we have designed KIN-2787 to target Class II and Class III BRAF alterations, where it would be a first-line targeted therapy, in addition to covering Class I BRAF mutations. In our in vivo and in vitro preclinical studies evaluating KIN-2787, we observed anti-tumor activity and kinase selectivity. Importantly, KIN-2787 demonstrated inhibition of RAF dimer signaling while minimizing MAPK pathway rebound, potentially resulting in a broad therapeutic index. In May 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-2787 (KN-8701) upon FDA clearance of our IND. We began dosing KIN-2787 in humans in the second half of 2021. KN-8701 is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-2787 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors driven by specific classes of BRAF alterations, which are known oncogenic drivers, while also characterizing pharmacological and anti-cancer properties of KIN-2787. In January 2022, we announced the addition of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma, a RAF-dependent cancer, into our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, KN-8701. In addition, we plan to initiate a combination portion of KN-8701 with binimetinib in patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma in the first half of 2022.
Background
 
BRAF alterations are found in multiple solid tumor cancer indications including NSCLC, melanoma, CRC, ovarian cancer and thyroid cancer. BRAF alterations drive tumor growth by activating the MAPK pathway.
 
BRAF alterations can be divided into three classes:
 

• | Class I: BRAF alterations where BRAF monomers activate the MAPK signaling pathway.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class II: BRAF alterations that generate BRAF homodimers, where two BRAF molecules combine, which are RAS-independent and activate the MAPK pathway. These are frequently the result of point mutations, indels or gene fusions, in which the kinase domain of BRAF is aberrantly joined to a partner gene. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class III: BRAF alterations with minimal kinase activity that induce BRAF’s dimerization to other RAF kinase family members (e.g., ARAF or CRAF), creating a RAF heterodimer with enhanced affinity to activated RAS and increased enzymatic activity and downstream signaling. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
All of the currently approved RAF inhibitors and many of those in clinical development target Class I mutations. Our RAF program targets Class II and Class III BRAF alterations, which represent cancer patient populations not currently treated by existing targeted therapeutics, in addition to covering Class I BRAF mutations.
 
The distinguishing features of the three classes of BRAF alterations are summarized in the table below.
 
Distinguishing features of BRAF Class I, Class II and Class III alterations.
 

 As shown in the figure below, the three currently approved BRAF-inhibiting drugs target Class I BRAF mutations, whereas we are focused on developing potent and selective RAF kinase inhibitors that can address additional BRAF dimer-dependent Class II and Class III alterations.
 
Cellular signaling of the three classes of BRAF alterations in human cancers.
 
 
BRAF alterations occur in approximately 6% of all human cancers, including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Currently, all approved RAF inhibitors target Class I mutations. We believe that a significant opportunity remains to develop novel kinase inhibitors that address patients with Class II and Class III BRAF alterations. The RAF market opportunity has grown due to recent advances in genomic profiling, allowing for the identification of Class II and Class III BRAF alterations that had not previously been possible. We believe there are patients with Class II and Class III BRAF alterations in a number of different cancers, including NSCLC, melanoma and CRC, as well as breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer and thyroid cancer, among other tumors. As commercially available diagnostic panels covering Class II and Class III BRAF alterations are more widely accessible and adopted, we believe the BRAF market will continue to grow.
 


  
Further, we believe that there remains a significant opportunity to develop novel kinase inhibitors that address patients with RAF-dependent cancers, such as NRAS-mutant melanoma, where signaling is highly CRAF-dependent. Approved BRAF inhibitors that target BRAF Class I alterations are not effective in treating patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma. Currently there is no approved targeted therapy approved for this patient population.
 
The table below reflects the biomarker prevalence for the indications related to KIN-2787.

Additionally, approximately 25% of patients who have Class I BRAF alterations develop a dimer-based resistance mechanism characterized as Class II or Class III BRAF alterations.

Our Opportunity and Solution
 
This lack of currently available therapies for Class II and Class III BRAF alterations and NRAS mutations presents a substantial need to develop potent inhibitors which can demonstrate inhibition of RAF dimer signaling while minimizing MAPK activation (pathway rebound) for patients with lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors that exhibit Class II and Class III BRAF alterations and/or oncogenic NRAS mutations.
Pathway Rebound
 
The pathway rebound challenge
 
Currently approved RAF inhibitor therapies do not inhibit both molecules in the dimer. Consequently, the non-inhibited molecule in the dimer is activated as depicted in the figure below. Therefore, instead of inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway, the drug activates signaling, which is referred to as paradoxical activation or pathway rebound. This pathway rebound, which sometimes reaches levels that are significantly higher than the original signal, limits the RAF inhibitor’s efficacy against cancer growth and also often causes other unwanted effects such as spurring additional cancer growth in non-cancerous tissues. For example, patients with Class I alterations treated by Zelboraf (vemurafenib) have been shown to develop squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and skin hyperplasias (e.g., hyperkeratosis) because this pathway rebound activates the MAPK signaling pathway in previously normal skin tissue.
Pathway rebound is a limitation of approved RAF kinase inhibitors.
 
 
In Class II BRAF alterations, the dimer is asymmetric and the active site of the second BRAF molecule is structurally distinct, making it difficult for current therapies to effectively inhibit RAF dimer dependent signaling. Furthermore, in Class III BRAF alterations, the second molecule of the dimer is often CRAF (see figure above), which emphasizes the requirement to bind and inhibit both BRAF and CRAF for effective signaling inhibition. To effectively block both molecules in these dimers, while avoiding pathway rebound and maintaining anti-tumor efficacy in patients with Class II and Class III BRAF alterations, a compound needs to have activity across RAF isoforms while maintaining selectivity against other kinases.
 


  
Our solution to pathway rebound
 
To address pathway rebound, KIN-2787 is specifically designed to inhibit both molecules of the dimer simultaneously, regardless of RAF isoform type. By inhibiting both molecules simultaneously, we aim to overcome the challenges created by asymmetric molecules and the subsequent potential for pathway rebound. We develop candidates using structure-based design and a screen with disease-relevant human cancer cell lines sensitive to pathway rebound. Enzymatic (biochemical) assays, as opposed to cellular screens, cannot identify compounds that may be effective against both molecules of a dimer because dimer formation does not occur outside of a cellular context. Our approach allows us to develop small molecules that may bind to both sides of the RAF dimer.
 
Maintaining Target Coverage
 
The target coverage challenge
 
An additional factor to address when developing drugs for Class II or Class III BRAF alterations is the requirement to maintain high levels of target coverage between doses. Low drug concentration may trigger pathway rebound as there may be insufficient coverage to inhibit both molecules of the RAF dimer. Maintaining adequate target coverage at all times is critical to avoid rebound signaling.
 
We believe that other drug candidates in development for Class II or Class III BRAF alterations, such as Fore Biotherapeutics’ PLX8394, Genentech / Hanmi Pharmaceutical co. ltd’s Belvarafenib (HM95573, RG6185), and Novartis’ LXH254 in particular, possess certain pharmaceutical properties which may have limited their target coverage. As a result, these drug candidates have been dosed to high levels and/or combined with other drugs in clinical trials, which has the potential to lead to increased toxicity and treatment complexity, in an attempt to maintain inhibition of the pathway.
 
Our solution to maintain broad target coverage
 
Once we identify compounds that can bind to both molecules of the dimer, we focus on optimization of pharmaceutical properties to ensure sufficient coverage to inhibit both molecules of the RAF dimer, ultimately aiming to achieve optimal target coverage. KIN-2787 is designed to have enhanced solubility, which has led to improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties across animal models that result in improved anti-cancer activity.
 
We believe that the pharmaceutical property enhancements of our candidate will afford better patient tolerability and more complete and effective coverage of the intended target. We anticipate this will translate to deeper and more sustained disease control and greater flexibility for rational combination therapy strategies in the future.
 
Our RAF Product Candidate: KIN-2787
 
We are focusing our clinical development efforts in Class II or Class III BRAF alteration-driven cancers, as well as NRAS-mutant melanoma, where patients do not respond to existing therapies or have few treatment options currently available to them. We plan to develop KIN-2787 for the treatment of patients with NSCLC and melanoma subpopulations with Class II or Class III BRAF alterations. These tumor types are especially dependent upon these BRAF alterations, creating promising opportunities to therapeutically target these genomic drivers. We also plan to develop KIN-2787 for the treatment of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma and explore treatment of other tumor types.
 
KIN-2787 is an orally available, reversible small molecule RAF inhibitor. KIN-2787 selectively targets RAF kinases and has demonstrated anti-cancer activity in sensitized cancer models driven by Class II BRAF fusions and BRAF homodimer-dependent indels and Class III BRAF alterations as well as NRAS-mutant melanoma.
 
Our preclinical studies of KIN-2787 have demonstrated tumor regressions in specific cancer models representing our target patient populations that harbor tumors driven by BRAF Class II and Class III alterations where no approved targeted therapy currently exists. KIN-2787 has also demonstrated improved pharmaceutical properties and human equivalent dose (HED) predictions compared to certain ongoing clinical development programs. These results support our belief that KIN-2787 has the potential to demonstrate therapeutic response by addressing challenges related to MAPK pathway rebound and target coverage. Further, preclinical studies of KIN-2787 as a single agent, and in combination with binimetinib has shown both in vitro and in vivo activity in NRAS-mutant melanoma, including showing significant tumor regressions at clinically relevant doses of KIN-2787 and binimetinib.
 
We have conducted 28-day good laboratory practice (GLP) oral toxicology studies for KIN-2787 using rat and cynomolgus monkey as relevant species for human risk assessment.
 


  
In May 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-2787 (KN-8701) upon FDA clearance of our IND. We began dosing KIN-2787 in humans in the second half of 2021. KN-8701 is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-2787 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors driven by specific classes of BRAF alterations, which are known oncogenic drivers, while also characterizing pharmacological and anti-cancer properties of KIN-2787.  In January 2022, we announced the addition of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma into our ongoing KN-8701 trial both in monotherapy and in combination with binimetinib. We anticipate initiating the combination portion of the trial in the first half of 2022.
 
We are also developing related backup molecules that we would plan to advance into the clinic only if, following the initiation of clinical trials for KIN-2787, we determine such molecules may have a superior safety or efficacy profile.
 
Preclinical Results
 
Based on evaluating more than 300 kinase assays, KIN-2787 displayed a highly selective kinome profile. These results were determined by radiometric kinase inhibition assays, a preferred standard for evaluating small molecule inhibitors. As depicted in the figure below, in this kinome profiling study, KIN-2787 substantially inhibited all three RAF kinases (ARAF, BRAF, CRAF) and partially inhibited few other (off-target) kinases. It therefore demonstrated a selective kinase profile relative to other pan-RAF inhibitors.

Percent (%) inhibition is relative to DMSO control. Kinases with >50% inhibition are shown with circle size indicating the relative potency. Kinome tree graphic was generated using CORAL (http://phanstiel-lab.med.unc.edu/CORAL/).
 
We performed additional studies to characterize the kinase inhibitory activity of KIN-2787 on kinases that were inhibited in the kinome profiling studies. As depicted in the table below, we measured the inhibitory activity of KIN-2787 on selected kinases typically inhibited by the RAF inhibitor class by utilizing an enzymatic (biochemical) assay. The drug concentrations that inhibited 50% of kinase activity are presented in nanomolar (nM) concentrations. We observed a highly selective kinome profile for KIN-2787 with greater than 867X inhibitory activity against RAF family kinases compared to the other notable off-target kinases, an exception is DDR1 (more than 15X higher IC50 than BRAF), which has a highly similar active site.
 


  
Inhibitory concentrations 50% (IC50s) determined from dose-response inhibition curves of kinases inhibited in the kinome profiling.
 

The selectivity of KIN-2787 was evaluated by comparing the inhibitory activity against ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF to off-target kinases discovered in the kinome profiling that was performed at a compound concentration of 1000 nM. Radiometric kinase assays were run at Km ATP concentration with compounds starting at 3000 nM. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined using a four-parameter fit model from a 10-point dose response curve performed with 3 replicates at each drug concentration and are presented in nM concentrations. Common BRAF inhibitor off-targets (EPHA2, KDR, LCK, and SRC) are represented as greater than the top drug concentration tested (> 3000 nM).
 
As shown in the table below, KIN-2787 exhibited activity against Class II and Class III BRAF alterations in cellular settings as measured by inhibition of pathway signaling. In these studies, we utilized phosphorylation of extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as a sensitive measure of MAPK signaling inhibition. With KIN-2787 we observed much lower MAPK pathway inhibition in cells expressing WT BRAF as exemplified by the NCI-H358, CHL-1 and BJ normal fibroblast cells. LXH-254 and belvarafenib, development stage type II pan-RAF inhibitors, demonstrate similar profiles to KIN-2787 with greatest potencies in Class II and Class III BRAF alteration-driven cells.  In contrast, a representative MEK inhibitor, Mektovi (binimetinib), demonstrated inhibition across all evaluated cellular settings including BRAF WT relative to MEK inhibition. We believe this selectivity of BRAF mutant versus BRAF WT is a differentiator and advantage of KIN-2787 by avoiding pathway inhibition in normal cells.

Cellular inhibitory activity for KIN-2787 compared to binimetinib, LXH254, and belvarafenib. More potent inhibition is reflected by a lower EC50 number presented in nM concentration. Cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 1 hour and pERK was measured in cell lysates using a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence assay. The compounds were run in 10-point, 3-fold serial dilution response starting at 10,000 nM to determine EC50 using a 4-parameter fit model. All samples were run in triplicate and represent an average of 3 or more independent experiments.
 
Enhancement of pharmaceutical properties was a major priority for our RAF inhibitor designs as traditional RAF inhibitors, both currently approved and in clinical development, have suffered from poor pharmaceutical properties including aqueous solubility. High aqueous solubility improves drug absorption, which enhances our ability to achieve greater target coverage in vivo. By modifying chemical scaffolds with chemical groups that improve aqueous solubility while maintaining potency of RAF inhibition, we identified KIN-2787 which demonstrated an aqueous solubility greater than 100 micromolar (uM) at pH 4.5 and greater than 300 uM at pH 2.0. These are substantially improved aqueous solubilities as compared to LXH254 and belvarafenib, as shown in the table below. Further, KIN-2787 has shown greater than seven fold more plasma free fraction (i.e. unbound drug) than LXH254 and belvarafenib. These improved pharmaceutical properties of KIN-2787 and increased drug exposure all enhance the likelihood that KIN-2787 may achieve greater target coverage in the clinical setting that we anticipate will lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity.

Daily dosing of KIN-2787 was well tolerated in athymic nude mice bearing A375 (BRAF Class I alteration), BxPC-3 (BRAF Class II alteration) or WM3629 (BRAF Class III alteration) human tumor cell xenografts in doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. As shown in the figure below, all three tumor models demonstrated tumor growth inhibition, as measured by mean tumor volume, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day. For comparison, we treated cohorts of tumor-bearing animals with 200 mg/kg/day of LXH254 leading to similar inhibitory activity to 60 mg/kg of KIN-2787. This 200 mg/kg/day dose of LXH254 represents more than a four-fold increased free drug exposure relative to the highest clinical dose (600 mg BID).

KIN-2787 or LXH254 or vehicle control dosing was initiated when tumors reached >200 mm3 after tumor inoculation and was performed by oral administration once a day. Groups consisted of n=9 mice and represent the average of tumor measurements +/- standard error of the mean (SEM). The 60mg/kg dose of KIN-2787 reflects the freebase formulation.
 
PD Studies and Pathway Rebound
 
In these studies, we measured phosphorylated ERK (pERK) as a sensitive marker of MAPK signaling in human WM3629 cancer cell line xenografts (BRAF Class III alteration) that were recovered from tumor-bearing mice after they had received a single dose of KIN-2787. As depicted in the figure below, a single 60 mg/kg dose demonstrated inhibition of ERK phosphorylation within 1 hour of treatment which was maintained through 7 hours post-treatment, while ERK phosphorylation partially recovered by 24 hours and returned to pre-treatment levels (100% of the control or baseline value) by 48 hours after treatment. Treatment with a single dose of LXH254 at 200 mg/kg led to pathway rebound of ERK phosphorylation to levels above 400% at 48 hours post-treatment, as depicted by the area shaded in red above 100% in the figure on the left below. In contrast, as depicted in the figure on the right below, KIN-2787 did not demonstrate significant pathway rebound in these studies in BRAF Class III mutant tumors.

All dosing performed by oral administration with n=3 tumors / time point. Tumors were measured for phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and represented as the average +/- SEM. C = control pERK levels from untreated tumors that serve as the reference for drug-treated tumor samples.
 


  
KIN-2787 is designed to and has demonstrated the ability in preclinical studies to:
 

• | inhibit RAF across both sides of the RAF dimer, which enables populations beyond Class I alterations to be targeted;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enable large drug exposures in vivo for BRAF mutant target coverage while avoiding pathway rebound; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | target Class II and Class III BRAF alterations, which has been enabled by technological advances and increased access to genomic profiling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To support translation of KIN-2787 into biomarker-defined clinical trials, we have established research programs with Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and University of California, San Francisco. These programs evaluate KIN-2787 in Class II BRAF alterations and in patient-derived xenograft models of Class II and Class III BRAF alterations. Outcomes are focused on supporting PK and PD relationships in clinically relevant models of Class II and Class III BRAF alterations.
 
We have completed a 28-day GLP toxicology study in rats and a 28-day GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys that together define the anticipated first-in-human dose for KIN-2787. All drug dose levels were well tolerated with no exposure-associated mortality, adverse clinical pathology observations, or substantive changes in vital measurements following completion of 28 days of dosing in both species. We believe KIN-2787 has a favorable therapeutic index as these GLP toxicology results demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated at levels that have shown anti-tumor activity in our other preclinical studies.
 
NRAS-mutant Melanoma Preclinical Proof of Concept
 
KIN-2787, as a single agent, and in combination with binimetinib, a MEK inhibitor, has shown activity in NRAS-mutant melanoma in preclinical studies. In vitro data indicates meaningful and synergistic combination benefit of KIN-2787 with binimetinib in NRAS-mutant melanoma cells. In in vivo xenograft models of NRAS-mutant melanoma, treatment with KIN-2787 in combination with binimetinib was well tolerated and resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition, including tumor regressions at clinically relevant twice-daily (BID) doses of KIN-2787 and binimetinib, respectively.

Clinical Development Plan
 
KN-8701
 In May 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-2787 (KN-8701) upon FDA clearance of our IND. We began dosing KIN-2787 in humans in the second half of 2021. KN-8701 is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-2787 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors driven by specific classes of BRAF alterations, which are known oncogenic drivers, while also characterizing pharmacological and anti-cancer properties of KIN-2787. KN-8701 is currently in the dose escalation portion of the trial. We anticipate initial data from KN-8701 trial in the third quarter of 2022. KIN-2787 has also demonstrated preclinical proof of concept activity in NRAS-mutant melanoma models as a single agent and in combination with binimetinib. Based on this preclinical proof of concept, in January 2022, we announced the addition of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma into our ongoing KN-8701 trial both in monotherapy and in combination with binimetinib. We anticipate initiating the combination portion of the trial in the first half of 2022.
 
KN-8701 is designed as follows:
 

• | Part A1: Dose Escalation (Monotherapy): Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors bearing any BRAF Class I, Class II or Class III alteration (including NSCLC, melanoma and other solid tumors) or NRAS-mutant melanoma will be enrolled in cohorts of 1 to 3 patients (modified 3+3 design) each to receive oral KIN-2787 monotherapy for up to 40 patients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Part A2: Dose Escalation (Combination with Binimetinib): Patients, including those with advanced or metastatic NRAS-mutant melanoma will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients (3+3 design) each to receive oral KIN-2787 in combination with binimetinib for up to approximately 36 patients. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Part B: Dose Expansion: Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors bearing either a Class II or Class III BRAF alteration (including NSCLC, melanoma and other solid tumors, but excluding Class I alteration-driven cancers) will be enrolled in one of a number of cohorts defined by cancer type or BRAF alteration of up to 20 to 30 patients per cohort to receive oral KIN-2787 as a single anti-cancer agent. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The objectives of the trial are to (1) assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-2787 when administered to cancer patients, (2) understand the relationship between dose and schedule of drug with PK, PD and changes in tumor-associated biomarkers, (3) determine a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule, and (4) gain an initial understanding of single agent anti-cancer efficacy in defined cancer patient populations. Our primary efficacy measures include objective measures of tumor response using RECIST v1.1, including number of responding patients, response rate, depth of response and DoR, utilizing standardized tumor imaging assessments at pre-specified intervals. The figure below illustrates our current clinical development plan.
 

Clinical development plan for KIN-2787 in patients with BRAF-driven advanced solid tumors.
 
 
In both Parts A and B, we leverage CLIA-compliant local tumor tissue or blood-based genomic profiling, such as MSK-IMPACT profiling, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or tumor tissue or blood-based genomic analysis performed at a central commercial laboratory, such as Foundation Medicine, Inc., for detection and inclusion of patients with specific BRAF alteration-driven cancers or NRAS-mutant melanoma in KN-8701. We also biobank tumor tissue and blood specimens for central retrospective analysis which we believe will enable the assessment of primary genomic alterations and other exploratory analyses.
 


  
The Phase 1 KN-8701 trial is currently active at multiple sites in US and Australia and we plan to expand our sites globally. The trial is designed to enroll a total of approximately 155 patients.
 
Based on the totality of clinical data from KN-8701, and predicated upon an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and a strong positive efficacy signal, we then expect to engage with the FDA and other regulatory authorities to plan one or more Phase 2 potentially registration-enabling trials in the United States and potentially other geographies. Where possible, we will explore applicable regulatory strategies pursued by other targeted therapy companies, for example Orphan drug designation, Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation, Priority Review and/or Accelerated Approval.
  
Growing Our RAF Franchise

      Beyond development of KIN-2787, we continue activities on chemotypes that are differentiated from KIN-2787. Additionally, we are investigating potential next-generation candidates with the possibility of expanding the therapeutic index and enabling further precision medicine strategies. For example, we may target RAF 1 (CRAF protein) gene fusions that are known drivers in primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, which remains a substantial unmet need. These programs are currently in preclinical research and we intend to develop them for future precision oncology clinical trials.
Our FGFR Program: KIN-3248
 
Overview
 
We are evaluating our FGFR inhibitor candidate, KIN-3248, for the treatment of patients with ICC and UC and other solid tumors. In preclinical studies, we have observed inhibitory activity across a broad range of clinically-relevant mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that drive resistance to current therapies. Because our preclinical studies demonstrated our candidates’ ability to cover the initial alterations and preemptively address these resistance mutations, we believe we may be able to meaningfully increase the DoR for certain patients by addressing these alterations. We plan to develop our candidates initially for patients whose tumors have acquired resistance to therapies targeting FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations, which limits the durability of response. As with other precision oncology approaches, addressing resistance mutations may also ultimately enable us to develop a first-line therapy.  In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 in the first quarter of 2022.
Background
 
Aberrations in FGFR signaling are an emerging opportunity for targeted therapy across multiple types of cancer, particularly UC and ICC and also gastric and breast cancers. Currently approved FGFR inhibitors have demonstrated clinical benefit, but response rates and DoR are limited. For FDA approved FGFR targeted drugs Balversa (erdafitinib), Pemazyre (pemigatinib), QED Therapeutics, Inc.’s Truseltiq (infigratinib), as well as TAS120 (futibatinib), which is in development, the response rate is approximately 30% to 35% among UC and ICC patients whose tumors are driven by FGFR-dependent driver genes. Further, the vast majority of those responding patients only demonstrate partial responses (i.e., partial tumor shrinkage) and the median DoR is only five months for Balversa (erdafitinib) and nine months for Pemazyre (pemigatinib). These resistance profiles are often caused by gatekeeper and molecular brake variants that emerge within the FGFR driver gene. The figure below shows the sensitivity and resistance of various oncogenic FGFR2 and FGFR3 indels and fusion genes. This lack of a response for most patients and short DoR for others presents a substantial need to develop potent and selective next-generation FGFR-targeting agents that can drive deeper and longer-lasting clinical benefit among responding patients.
 
First-generation inhibitors including Balversa (erdafitinib), Pemazyre (pemigatinib) and futibatinib and our next-generation FGFR-targeting small molecules in development effectively target non drug-resistant FGFR2 and FGFR3 driver genes. Among these, we believe only KIN-3248 has been shown in preclinical studies to effectively inhibit the full spectrum of clinically-described and predicted resistance mutations in FGFR cancer driver genes.
 


  
Kinnate’s FGFR inhibitors retain activity against common FGFR2 and FGFR3 resistance mutations.
 

Hyperphosphatemia, an elevated level of phosphate in the blood, is a common, and typically manageable, adverse effect of FGFR-targeting drugs. This adverse event is driven by FGFR1-dependent inhibition of phosphate reabsorption in the kidney. Typically, hyperphosphatemia is managed by dietary modification and phosphate-binding medication. Many oncology drug developers have tried to select against FGFR1 instead of targeting 1, 2 or 3 specific FGFR isoforms, but given very high sequence similarity in the kinase domains of FGFR family members, it remains exceptionally challenging to retain potent FGFR2 and FGFR3 inhibition and avoid FGFR1 kinase inhibition. Based on our conversations with clinicians and key opinion leaders, we believe that broad coverage of primary FGFR2 and FGFR3 oncogenic driver alterations and the acquired, on-target resistance mutations is more important clinically than reducing hyperphosphatemia. Additionally, inhibition of FGFR1 may have clinical benefits.
 
Oncogenic FGFR2 gene fusions have been observed in 10% to 16% of patients with ICC, while oncogenic FGFR3 alterations are estimated to be found in approximately 15% to 20% of patients with UC. Given these populations and the significant percentage of patients who develop resistance to currently approved FGFR inhibitors, we believe there is a significant commercial opportunity to develop a next-generation FGFR inhibitor that will effectively cover the initial fusions or alterations and the common resistance alleles that may eventually develop.

The Opportunity
 
The lack of a response for most patients and short DoR for others with respect to existing therapies presents a substantial need to develop potent and selective next-generation FGFR-targeting agents that can drive deeper and longer-lasting clinical benefit among responding patients.
Resistance Mutations
 
The challenge of resistance mutations
 
Most recently, the emergence of resistance mutations in FGFR driver genes (at or even prior to the emergence of clinical progression or relapse in drug-treated patients) has highlighted the limitation of both currently approved FGFR-targeting drugs and other clinical stage compounds. While this acquired mutational resistance in FGFR serves to further validate FGFR driver genes as drug targets, it also highlights both the need and the opportunity to develop potent, selective and specific FGFR-targeting agents that target existing mutational resistance and prevent emergence of new resistance mutations.
 
Common mechanisms driving this acquired resistance are referred to as gatekeeper mutations (V565F/I in FGFR2 and V555M in FGFR3) and molecular brake mutations (N550K/H in FGFR2 or N540S or K650M/E in FGFR3). The mutated gatekeeper amino acid influences binding site properties which can prevent binding of FGFR inhibitors to the target site (FGFR2 and FGFR3). Molecular brake mutations increase kinase activation, overcoming drug efficacy. Both gatekeeper and molecular brake mutations drive acquired resistance to current therapies.
 
Our solution to resistance mutations
 
We believe that selectively targeting the initial oncogenic alteration in addition to acquired gatekeeper and/or molecular brake alterations has the potential to overcome the challenges presented by resistance mutations. To improve DoR, our next-generation FGFR inhibitors in development target acquired resistance mutations identified in patients treated with FGFR targeted therapies. We are seeking to develop product candidates to inhibit the initial alteration or fusion in addition to the gatekeeper and molecular brake resistance mutations. Specifically, we have designed our candidates to address mutations, such as gatekeeper and molecular brake mutations, which we believe to be the most common acquired resistance mutations.
 
While we are initially pursuing this as a second-line treatment, we ultimately plan to explore first-line therapy as well, where coverage across both initial and acquired mutations may translate to longer DoR, displacing existing FGFR2 and FGFR3 targeting drugs. This is analogous to the path taken in the successful development of Tagrisso (osimertinib), an EGFR-targeting small molecule drug that potently inhibits both WT and specific, critical gatekeeper EGFR mutations that confer resistance to first-generation EGFR-targeting drugs such as Tarceva (erlotinib).
 


  
 Limited Coverage
 
The challenge with limited coverage
 
Isoform-selective FGFR inhibition may lead to activation of other FGFR kinases. This reactivation of FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 signaling represents a potential compensation mechanism that drives resistance to selective therapies. Evidence of this has already been seen with FGFR2-specific inhibitors that have resulted in the appearance of FGFR1 or FGFR3 oncogenic driver alterations. Without broad inhibition of the FGFR kinase family, DoR and response rates may be limited.
 
Our solution to overcoming limited coverage
 
Our next-generation FGFR inhibitor candidates are structurally designed to inhibit molecular brake and gatekeeper mutations while maintaining broad coverage across FGFR isoforms (i.e., FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3). This broad-based approach may prevent compensatory mechanisms that would otherwise limit response rates or DoR.
 
FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 alterations are predominantly found in different tumor types. FGFR2 alterations are known oncogenic drivers in ICC and FGFR3 alterations are known oncogenic drivers in urothelial tumors. In addition, evidence suggests that FGFR1 alterations exist in breast cancer and may be oncogenic drivers. Therefore, a drug that broadly inhibits FGFR isoforms may be effective across multiple tumor types.
 
In addition to covering broad FGFR isoforms, there is an opportunity to cover other potential escape routes by providing coverage of FGFR indels and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) beyond the fusions targeted by currently approved therapies. Coverage across both the intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms may translate into more durable DoR, displacing existing FGFR2 and FGFR3 targeting drugs.
 
Our FGFR Program: KIN-3248
 
Our FGFR candidate, KIN-3248, is a covalent (irreversible) kinase inhibitor, designed to address clinically observed  mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that drive resistance to current therapies. We are evaluating KIN-3248 for the treatment of patients with ICC and UC and may expand into other FGFR-driven solid tumors, such as breast cancer.
 
In preclinical studies we have observed inhibitory activity across a broad range of clinically relevant mutations that drive acquired resistance. We believe that by addressing these mutations and broadly covering FGFR isoforms, we may be able to meaningfully increase the DoR.
 
We have completed in vitro and in vivo profiling of KIN-3248. We have conducted 28-day GLP oral toxicology studies for KIN-3248 using rat and dog as relevant species for human risk assessment. In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 in the first quarter of 2022.
 
Preclinical Results
 
Based on evaluating more than 300 kinase assays, KIN-3248 displayed a highly selective kinome profile. As depicted in the figure below, in this kinome profiling study, KIN-3248 substantially inhibited (> 90% kinase inhibition) three FGFR kinases (FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4) and partially inhibited a few other (off-target) kinases including TNK1 and STK10. By comparison, the FDA approved FGFR2/3 inhibitor erdafitinib (Balversa) inhibited the FGFR family of kinases, but demonstrated off-target inhibition of several receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., KDR, PDGFRalpha, KIT, CSF1R, DDR1, DDR2) that are known to be common off-targets for FGFR inhibitors. Therefore, KIN-3248 demonstrated an improved kinase selectivity profile relative to erdafitinib.

As shown in the table below, initial preclinical study results for our FGFR inhibitor candidate, KIN-3248, showed improved inhibition of the gatekeeper mutations (FGFR2 V565F and FGFR3 V555M) when compared to the FDA approved FGFR inhibitors, Balversa (erdafitinib) and Pemazyre (pemigatinib), and the FGFR inhibitor clinical candidate TAS120 (futibatinib), in enzymatic assays.

 Enzymatic inhibitory activity of KIN-3248 against FGFR family kinases and common resistance mutations compared to erdafitinib, pemigatinib and futibatinib in internal head-to-head comparisons. Biochemical activity is measured by a shift in electrophoretic mobility of a peptide substrate upon phosphorylation with the designated FGFR kinase. The potency of kinase inhibition is presented as the concentration of specified compound that inhibited 50% of the maximum kinase activity (IC50). Kinase inhibition assays were performed at 100 uM ATP concentration with no pre-incubation of the compounds with the kinase. In the lower section of the table, the relative inhibitory activity of the specified compound toward mutant versus respective WT kinase is displayed as fold differences in IC50 values. Ratios <10X (as highlighted by green text for KIN-3248) represent retained activity of either the resistance mutation or corresponding WT kinase. Ratios >10X (as highlighted by red text) represent a substantial loss of activity against the indicated resistance mutation compared to the corresponding WT kinase.
 


  
KIN-3248 similarly demonstrated inhibition of cell viability in patient-derived CCLP-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells engineered to express either unmutated FGFR2 gene fusions (WT) or comparable gene fusions that harbor secondary resistance mutations (e.g., V565F and N550K). Other FGFR-targeting compounds were assayed in the same studies and displayed significantly less inhibition of specific mutant FGFR2 alleles. For example, pemigatinib and futibatinib had EC50 values for the FGFR2 V565F mutation that were more than 6,000 nM and 129 nM, respectively. For example, pemigatinib and futibatinib had fold-difference in EC50 values for the FGFR2 V565F mutation relative to WT that were >1000x and >300x  respectively. This compares to 1.5x for KIN-3248. Fold-difference in EC50 values for specific FGFR2 mutant alleles compared to WT are presented in the figure / heatmap below (left panel).
 
In addition to the acquired resistance mutations described above, there are other clinically relevant FGFR2 mutations, including additional gatekeeper (e.g., V565L and V565I), molecular brake / regulatory region (e.g., N550H and E566A), and activating mutations (e.g., K650M), as well as the corresponding FGFR3 mutations. These mutations may limit the potency of both approved FGFR inhibitors (e.g., pemigatinib) and FGFR therapies in clinical development, such as RLY-4008. Consistent with the biochemical data, KIN-3248 demonstrated a ratio less than 5-fold for these resistance mutations compared to the unmutated FGFR2 fusion in cell-based assays. This suggests that KIN-3248 has a unique ability to retain activity across V565L, V565I, and M538I, and therefore demonstrates a potential advantage in limiting the emergence of these resistance mutations in patients with FGFR2-driven cancers.

The cellular activity of KIN-3248 compared to pemigatinib and futibatinib, was evaluated in patient-derived FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, CCLP-1 and ICC13-7, engineered to express selected secondary FGFR2 resistance mutations. Inhibition of cell viability was measured by MTT assay following 3 or 10 days of treatment in multiple independent experiments. EC50 values were calculated using a dose-response regression curve fitting utilizing a 4-parameter analytical method. Relative inhibitory activity of the specified compound toward mutant versus WT FGFR2 kinase is displayed as fold differences in EC50 values (left panel). To evaluate clonal outgrowth (right panel), FGFR2 mutants were pooled and treated with KIN-3248 or the indicated FGFR inhibitors for 2 weeks. Clonal prevalence at the start and end of treatment was determined by ddPCR and presented as relative mutant allele frequency.

Inhibition of cell viability was measured following 5 days of treatment in multiple independent experiments. EC50 values were calculated using a dose-response regression curve fitting utilizing a 4-parameter analytical method.

Continuous daily dosing of KIN-3248 was well tolerated in athymic nude mice bearing SNU-16 (FGFR2 amplified and fusion-positive gastric cancer), and RT-112 (FGFR3 fusion-positive bladder cancer) human tumor cell xenografts at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day. As shown in the figure below, both tumor models demonstrated tumor growth inhibition, as measured by mean tumor volume, at 5 and 15 mg/kg/day doses.

The anti-tumor activity of KIN-3248 was next evaluated in cancer cell line (CDX)- and patient-derived (PDX) tumor xenograft models with FGFR2 resistance mutations. Treatment with KIN-3248 at 15 mg/kg/day led to 72%, 116%, and 102% tumor growth inhibition and regressions in models harboring M538I / M539L (activation loop), V565L (gatekeeper), and N550K (molecular brake) mutations associated with clinical resistance to FGFR inhibitors. In contrast, pemigatinib and futibatinib displayed a lack of or limited efficacy against these FGFR2 resistance mutations.

Groups consisted of n=6-12 mice and represent the average tumor volume +/- standard error of the mean (SEM).
 
The currently approved FGFR inhibitors bind to the kinase active site in a reversible binding mode. By modifying small molecules with a reactive chemical warhead that irreversibly (covalently) reacts with a specific cysteine amino acid found in the active site of the kinase, we believe that FGFR inhibitors can achieve enhanced selectivity and potency across clinically-relevant secondary resistance mutations, including those that have been observed among futibatinib-treated patients.
 
Examples of approved kinase inhibitors that employ this irreversible binding mode include Imbruvica (ibrutinib) and Tagrisso (osimertinib), each of which covalently reacts with a specific cysteine found in the active sites of BTK and EGFR kinases, respectively. Similar to osimertinib’s irreversible binding to EGFR while maintaining activity against T790M gatekeeper mutations, our designs enable an irreversible interaction with the cysteine in the FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 kinase active site, while avoiding the hindrance of binding by gatekeeper mutations that was observed with futibatinib.
 
We have completed a 28-day GLP toxicology study in rats and a 28-day GLP toxicology study in dogs that together define the anticipated first-in-human dose for KIN-3248. All drug dose levels were well tolerated with no exposure-associated mortality, adverse clinical pathology observations, or substantive changes in vital measurements following completion of 28 days of dosing in both species. We believe KIN-3248 has a favorable therapeutic index as these GLP toxicology results demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated at levels that have shown anti-tumor activity in our other preclinical studies.
 
Clinical Development Plan
 
KN-4802
 
In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 (KN-4802) in the first quarter of 2022. KN-4802 is primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-3248 in both FGFR inhibitor naïve and pre-treated patient populations with molecularly-defined FGFR2- and/or FGFR3-alteration driven cancers. KN-4802 is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-3248 in FGFR inhibitor naïve and pretreated cancer patients with FGFR2 and/or FGFR3 gene alterations while also characterizing pharmacological and anti-cancer activity of KIN-3248.
 
KN-4802 is designed as follows:
 

• | Part A: Dose Escalation: Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors in both FGFR inhibitor naïve and pre-treated patient populations with molecularly-defined FGFR2- and/or FGFR3-alteration driven cancers, including a limited number of patients with FGFR2 or FGFR3 amplification-driven cancers. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients each to receive oral KIN-3248 as a single agent for up to 45 patients. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Part B: Dose Expansion: Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors bearing with molecularly-defined FGFR2- and/or FGFR3-alteration driven cancers will be enrolled in one of a number of cohorts defined by disease or biomarker of up to 20 to 30 patients per cohort to receive oral KIN-3248 as a single agent. This would include both FGFR inhibitor naïve and pre-treated patient populations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 


  
The objectives of the trial are to (1) assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-3248 when administered to cancer patients, (2) understand the relationship between dose and schedule of drug with PK, PD and changes in tumor-associated biomarkers, (3) determine a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule, and (4) gain an initial understanding of single agent anti-cancer efficacy in defined cancer patient cohorts. Our primary efficacy measures include objective measures of tumor response using RECIST v1.1, including number of responding patients, response rate, depth of response and DoR, utilizing standardized tumor imaging assessments at pre-specified intervals. The figure below illustrates our current clinical development plan.
 
Clinical development plan for KIN-3248 in patients with FGFR2- and/or FGFR3-driven advanced solid tumors.
 

In both Parts A and B, we leverage CLIA-compliant local tumor tissue or blood-based genomic profiling, such as MSK-IMPACT profiling, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or tumor or blood-based genomic analysis performed at a central commercial laboratory, such as Foundation Medicine, Inc., for detection and inclusion of specific FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations. We also biobank tumor tissue and blood specimens for central retrospective analysis which we believe will enable the assessment of primary genomic alterations and other exploratory analyses.
 
CDK12 (KIN004) and Other Research Programs
 
CDK12 (KIN004)
 
We are also advancing a number of other small molecule research programs, including a CDK12 inhibitor in our KIN004 program. CDK12 is an essential regulator of DDR genes and no approved CDK12-targeting therapies are currently available or, to our knowledge, in clinical development. We are developing a candidate to target the unmet clinical need in the treatment of OC, mCRPC and TNBC.
 
Despite the significant clinical benefits of approved poly ADP-Ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in the treatment of eligible patients with advanced or metastatic OC and mCRPC, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (including PD-1 and PD-L1 targeting agents) for those with TNBC, acquired drug resistance remains a significant challenge in the majority of cases.
 
We believe that targeted CDK12 inhibition with a selective small molecule therapeutic offers the potential to:
 

• | significantly augment the clinical benefits of PARP inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents and ICIs in the subset of these cancer patients who are currently eligible to be treated with these drugs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | therapeutically sensitize cancers from expanded populations of OC, mCRPC and TNBC patients who are not currently eligible to receive PARP inhibitors or ICIs, and who yet may gain substantial benefit from combination therapy with either PARP inhibitors, conventional chemotherapies, or an ICI agent. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
CDK12 is a critical regulator of both the DDR pathway and neoantigen formation in tumors. The figure below illustrates the CDK12 pathway regulating DDR gene transcription. We are developing selective CDK12 irreversible kinase inhibitors that are designed to induce DDR deficiencies in patients with DDR-proficient tumors.
 


  
Therapeutic CDK12 inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to existing cancer therapies through two distinct mechanisms which operate in parallel.
 
 
(Left) CDK12 inhibition significantly reduces expression of DNA damage response (DDR) genes through its selective impact on transcription of long genes, many of which encode regulators of the DNA damage pathway. This inhibition leads to dramatic sensitization of cancer cells to DNA damaging chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors (PARPi). (Right) CDK12 inhibition is expected to produce large tandem duplications in cellular DNA that express neoantigens that are subsequently presented on the cell surface. We expect that expression of these neoantigens provides a unique opportunity to synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to produce an enhanced anti-tumor immune response.
 
CDK12 inhibition sensitizes tumors to DNA damaging agents and induces synthetic lethality in both DDR-deficient and, more importantly, DDR-proficient tumors. Synthetic lethality is an approach in oncology drug development that is focused on identifying and selecting patient subgroups with specific genomic alterations in tumors that are most likely to benefit from these therapies and improving tolerability and reducing toxicity by not affecting normal, non-cancerous cells.
 
Our goal is to limit the expression of DDR genes including BRCA1 and BRCA2, among other DDR genes, to shift DDR-proficient tumors into a sensitized DDR-deficient state. This would enable a synthetic lethality approach in DDR-proficient tumors via combination therapy with currently approved PARP inhibitors.
 
Additionally, in published third party preclinical studies, CDK12 inactivation induced formation of large tandem duplications that expressed as fusion-induced neoantigens and synergized with ICIs to augment an enhanced anti-tumor immune response, which we anticipate will translate to a deeper and more durable clinical benefit.
 
CDK12 has a novel cysteine in the active site of the enzyme, enabling specificity via an irreversible (covalent) binding mode as described for our FGFR program. We have employed structure-based drug discovery efforts from an early co-crystal structure that led to identification of highly specific small molecules that covalently bind to and inhibit CDK12, as shown by the kinome profile in the figure below.

Kinome tree depicting kinase selectivity for KIN004 at 1000 nM across 275 kinases in single dose, duplicate measurements (272 kinases at Thermo Fisher Scientific and 3 kinases at Reaction Biology Europe GmbH). Percent (%) inhibition is relative to DMSO control. Kinases with >50% inhibition are shown with circle size indicating the relative potency as depicted in the legend. Kinome tree graphic was generated using CORAL (http://phanstiel-lab. med.unc.edu/CORAL/).
 

Following kinome profiling, related CDK family members were tested in radiometric enzymatic assays and demonstrated a >40X selectivity of CDK12 compared to CDK7 and CDK9 and >50X selectivity of CDK12 compared to CDK2. These active sites are highly related among the CDK family members and these selectivity ratios enable specific targeting of CDK12 in vivo.
 
Inhibitory concentrations 50% (IC50s) determined from dose-response inhibition curves of kinases inhibited in the kinome profiling.
 

KIN004 follow-up 10 point dose response kinase assays demonstrated selective CDK12 inhibition compared to highly homologous CDK2, CDK7, and CDK9 family members. Results in the table represent IC50 averages (from curves fitted with a 4-parameter analysis) of greater than 3 independent experiments for CDK7, CDK9, and CDK12, and 2 independent experiments for CDK2 performed at Reaction Biology Europe GmbH. All radiometric assays were performed for 30 minutes with an optimal ATP concentration for the respective kinase.
 
In our preclinical studies, selective CDK12 pharmacological inhibition via biweekly, intravenous administration of a compound in the KIN004 program demonstrated tumor regressions at 25 mg/kg in two independent BRCA1/2 WT breast (HCC70 tumors) and ovarian (OVCAR-3) tumors implanted in athymic nude mice shown in the figure below. This is important as DDR-deficient tumors (e.g., BRCA1 mutant) are hypersensitive to both CDK12 and PARP inhibition. This proof of concept suggests that CDK12 inhibition impacted DDR pathways and has the potential to expand into patient populations beyond those settings that are currently approved for treatment with PARP inhibitors.
 


  
Anti-tumor activity of KIN004 in DDR-proficient breast and ovarian tumors in vivo.
 

HCC70 breast tumors (left) and OVCAR-3 ovarian tumors (right) represent BRCA1/2 WT cancers that were DDR-proficient and were not sensitized to PARP inhibitor treatment. KIN004 was dosed at 25 mg/kg twice per week by intravenous administration and tumor volumes represent averages of n=8 tumors / group +/-SEM.
 
Treatment of HCC70 tumor xenografts with 25 mg/kg KIN004 demonstrated a time-dependent inhibition of biomarkers known to be the target of CDK12 activity in the cell. The same HCC70 tumors demonstrated time-dependent inhibition of gene expression of known DDR genes including BRCA1 and BRCA2 shown in the central panel of the outlined figure below. As a control, MCL1 expression was measured as this gene is regulated by CDK7, and no change in expression was observed. The absence of any effect of KIN004 on gene expression of MCL1 confirmed the selective inhibition of CDK12 over CDK7 that was demonstrated in biochemical assays. This in vivo modulation of CDK12-regulated DDR genes in BRCA1/2 WT tumors further supports the mechanism by which DDR-proficient tumors are converted to a DDR-deficient state by selective pharmacological CDK12 irreversible inhibition.
 
CDK12 inhibition downregulated DDR gene expression in vivo in breast tumors.
 
 
(Left) HCC70 tumors treated with 25 mg/kg KIN004 demonstrated time-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of RNA Polymerase II on serine 2. Middle (teal outlined cluster of 2 graphs): Treatment of HCC70 tumors with 25 mg/kg KIN004 decreased expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 as expected since CDK12 activity is well-documented as regulating transcription of these and additional DNA damage response genes. (Right) KIN004 did not modulate MCL1 gene expression in vivo and signals selective CDK12 inhibition relative to CDK7 inhibition. CDK7 is known to regulate MCL1 gene expression, a proapoptotic gene, and lack of CDK7 inhibition is expected to leave MCL1 gene expression unaffected as depicted in the graph. All time points represent analysis of n=3 HCC70 tumors for each readout presented. In all figures above, black circles represent untreated tumors (Vehicle) for reference and teal circles represent tumors treated by intravenous administration with 25 mg/kg of KIN004.
 


  
We are currently optimizing an orally bioavailable compound series in the KIN004 program. Additionally, we are evaluating fusion-induced neoantigen generation with selective pharmacological CDK12 inhibition in mouse cancer models with intact immune systems. These “proof of mechanism” studies will enable combination efficacy experiments with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs - e.g., anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) to understand the synthetic lethality potential of this combination approach. There is an evolving biological understanding of CDK12 inactivating mutations in prostate and ovarian cancers that produce fusion-induced neoantigens, sensitizing these tumors for combinations with ICIs. Currently ICIs are being tested clinically in patients with tumors with naturally occurring inactive CDK12.
 
Additional Research Programs
 
Our Kinnate Discovery Engine is continuing to execute on target and lead identification to develop therapeutics that address oncogenic drivers in high unmet need populations. Additionally, we are exploring intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms to drugs that are currently approved or in development to improve clinical benefit and response rates. To enable efficiency, we are leveraging our global collaborations with leaders at a variety of academic centers, respected industry partners, and key opinion leader networks, to identify additional development opportunities that complement our internal research and development efforts.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, the expertise of our team, and our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face increasing competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
 
Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, and are more convenient or less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or could otherwise make our development more complicated. We believe the key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, including DoR and breadth of coverage, safety and patient convenience.
 
There are currently three BRAF-targeted kinase inhibitor drugs approved for use in Class I BRAF alterations:  Novartis AG’s Tafinlar (dabrafenib), Genentech’s, a member of the Roche Group, Zelboraf (vemurafenib) and Pfizer’s Braftovi (encorafenib) are used in BRAF mutated melanomas, Tafinlar (dabrafenib) is also used in mutated NSCLC and anaplastic thyroid cancer, and Braftovi (encorafenib) is also used in mutated CRC. FORE-8394 / PLX8394, a BRAF homodimer disruptor, is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials with Fore Biotherapeutics. Second-generation BRAF dimer signaling inhibitors, such as LXH254 and Belvarafenib (HM95573, RG6185), designed to inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling without causing pathway rebound, are in Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials with Novartis AG and Genentech / Hanmi Pharmaceutical co. ltd, respectively. Mapkure, LLC’s BGB3245 and Day One Pharmaceuticals’ DAY101 are also currently in clinical development, along with other RAF inhibitors.
 
There are three currently approved selective FGFR2 and FGFR3 inhibitors: Incyte Corporation’s Pemazyre (pemigatinib), Janssen Biotech, Inc.’s Balversa (erdafitinib), QED Therapeutics, Inc.’s Truseltiq (infigratinib) and a number of programs that are in development, including Taiho Oncology, Inc.’s TAS120 (futibatinib), Relay Therapeutics, Inc.’s FGFR2-specific clinical candidate (RLY4008), Tyra Biosciences, Inc.’s FGFR3-specific preclinical candidate (TYRA-300) and FGFR2-specific candidate, and Loxo Oncology at Lilly’s FGFR3-specific preclinical candidate (LOXO-435).
 
Our Scientific Collaborations
 
To help advance our programs, we are working with Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and University of California, San Francisco, leading clinical research institutions, and plan to enter into additional collaborations. Each of these collaborations is (or will be) focused on translational strategies to support the clinical study of our new therapy candidates. For example, we will work with these research organizations to:

• | define emerging patient populations;
--+-------------------------------------


• | demonstrate selective in vitro and in vivo activity and define dose-exposure pharmacodynamic relationships in clinically relevant models;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | test prioritized compounds against specific mutations and fusions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | investigate mechanism of action-the specific biochemical interaction through which a drug substance produces its pharmacological effect-to support the refinement of strategies for patient selection and patient stratification for both monotherapy and rationale combinations; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | develop biomarker-based development strategies that will drive patient selection in our clinical programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have also established collaborations through service agreements with global CROs, under which we utilize over 150 full-time equivalent personnel to provide scale and expertise in areas including, among others, research chemistry, chemical manufacturing, biology, pharmacology and toxicology, and clinical studies.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including obtaining, maintaining and defending our patent rights. We own the patent applications relating to our lead and planned product candidates. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications and obtaining issued patents in the United States and in markets outside of the United States directed to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of oncology. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own or license in the future; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 
As of February 17, 2022, our patent portfolio consisted of issued patents and pending patent applications that we own related to our small molecule kinase inhibitor programs, including our RAF, FGFR and CDK12 programs. In total, as of that date, we owned three issued United States patents, 20 pending United States patent applications, seven international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT application) and 45 pending patent applications in various markets outside of the United States, including Europe, China and Japan.
 
With respect to KIN-2787, as of February 17, 2022, we owned one issued United States patent, one pending PCT application and five pending patent applications in the United States, Taiwan and Argentina with claims covering KIN-2787 as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of use. The issued United States patent covering KIN-2787 as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of use is expected to expire in October 2040, absent any patent term extensions for regulatory delay. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications related to KIN-2787 are expected to expire between October 2040 and April 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions for regulatory delay.
 
With respect to KIN-3248, as of February 17, 2022, we owned one pending PCT application, and five pending patent applications in the United States, Taiwan and Argentina with claims covering KIN-3248 as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of use. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications related to KIN-3248 are expected to expire in June 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions for regulatory delay.
 
With respect to KIN004, as of February 17, 2022, we owned one issued United States patent, one pending PCT application, and 15 pending patent applications in the United States, Europe, China, Japan and other markets outside of the United States. The issued United States patent covering KIN004 as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of use is expected to expire in June 2039, absent any patent term extensions for regulatory delay. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications are expected to expire between June 2039 and December 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions for regulatory delay.
 
We also possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology.



  
With respect to our product candidates and processes that we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies.
 
Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for patent applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The term of United States patents may be extended by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the USPTO, also known as patent term adjustment. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of oncology has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
 
Commercialization
 
We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates, as well as our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates.
 
To date, we have obtained for our product candidates active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from Patheon API Services, Inc. and drug product from Serán BioScience, Inc. and BioDuro LLC, each of whom we currently rely on as single-source contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our product candidates and intend to put in place framework agreements under which third-party CMOs will generally provide us with necessary quantities of API and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development needs.
 


  
As we advance our product candidates through development, we will explore adding backup suppliers for the API and drug product for each of our product candidates to protect against any potential supply disruptions.
 
We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Our product candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
 

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (GCP) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for substantive review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements assuring that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any current and future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 


  
Preclinical Studies and IND
 
The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
Clinical Trials
 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (IRB) for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB must also approve the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will generally accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles contained in the Declaration of Helsinki pursuant to 21 CFR 312.120(c)(4), incorporating the 1989 version of the Declaration, or with the laws and regulations of the foreign regulatory authority where the trial was conducted, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects, and with GCP and GMP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States.
 
Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.
 

• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use and its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, are conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. The sponsor is also responsible for submitting written IND safety reports, including reports of serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically significant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 


  
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process, as performed by the manufacturing facility, must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of our product candidates. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their labeled shelf life.
 
We may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, in March 2020, the FDA issued a guidance, which the FDA subsequently updated, on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical trial report contingency measures implemented to manage the clinical trial, and any disruption of the clinical trial as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA has also published other COVID-19-related industry guidance, including updates to previous guidance, regarding Good Manufacturing Practices, remote interactive evaluations of drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring facilities, and drug product manufacturing and supply chain inspections, among others. It is possible that additional governmental action will be taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and future developments, including new regulatory requirements and changes to existing regulations.
 
NDA Review Process
 
Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the safety and efficacy of the investigational product has been demonstrated for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA is a request for approval to market the drug in the United States for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug.
 
The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 


  
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA’s interpretation of data may differ from our interpretation.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication for which we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies.
 
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. FDA may withdraw drug approval or require changes to the labeled indication of the drug if confirmatory post-market trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
 


  
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or may decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 
  FDA Regulation Of Companion Diagnostics
 
A therapeutic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to that therapy. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product and if the manufacturer wishes to market or distribute such diagnostic for use as a companion diagnostic, then the FDA will require separate approval or clearance of the diagnostic as a companion diagnostic to the therapeutic product. According to FDA guidance, an unapproved or uncleared companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational medical device unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. The sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations for clinical studies involving the investigational diagnostic device. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same clinical trial, if the trial meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the clinical trial protocol, the investigational product(s), and subjects involved, a sponsor may seek to submit an IDE alone (e.g., if the drug has already been approved by FDA and is used consistent with its approved labeling), or both an IND and an IDE.
 
Pursuing FDA approval/clearance of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require either a pre-market notification, also called 510(k) clearance, or a pre-market approval, or PMA, or a de novo classification for that diagnostic. The review of companion diagnostics involves coordination of review with the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
 
510(k) clearance process
 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a pre-market notification is submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet required the submission of a PMA application. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process may take three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take longer if FDA requests additional information, among other reasons. In some cases, the FDA may require clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, which may significantly prolong the review process. Notwithstanding compliance with all these requirements, clearance is never assured.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or require a PMA. In addition, the FDA may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, which may significantly affect the process.
 
De novo classification process
 
If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a different route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
 


  
Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo down-classification, or approval for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, and may take several years, and generally requires significant scientific and clinical data.
 
PMA process
 
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for medical devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes extensive testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance and GMP requirements.
 
Post-approval Requirements
 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse events and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label promotion,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention;
--+------------------------------


• | refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 


  
Similar to post-approval regulatory requirements that apply to drug products, for any medical devices that we may develop in the future, after a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the quality manufacturing requirements set forth in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, labeling regulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off label” uses, registration and listing, the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if the device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). The FDA enforces these requirements by unannounced inspection, market surveillance and other means. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an untitled regulatory letter or a warning letter, to more severe sanctions such as fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and criminal prosecution.
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
 
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to various healthcare laws, regulation, and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Our conduct, including those of our employees, as well as our business operations and relationships with third parties, including current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market, and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, and/or impose exclusions from federal health care programs and/or penalties for parties who engage in such prohibited conduct. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations also impose obligations on covered entities such as health insurance plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain health care providers and their respective business associates, including mandatory contractual terms as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), information regarding certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others), and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and require the registration of their sales representatives, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 


  
Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, the distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act as well as other applicable consumer safety requirements.
 
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
 
U.S. Patent-term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or generate such data themselves.
 
European Union Drug Development
 
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA), and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 


  
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014, which entered into application on January 31, 2022, ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical and simplifies the rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance. .
 
European Union Drug Review and Approval
 
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union and three European Free Trade Association States (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations.

• | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SOPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SOPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of our products, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.
 
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 


  
In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
 
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.
 
Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the BBA), among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans.  In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. In January 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order that initiates a special enrollment period to allow people to obtain health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, and instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, among others. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the ACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.
 


  
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, in 2020, HHS and CMS issued various rules that are expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against HHS challenging various aspects of the rules implemented during the Trump administration. As a result, the Biden administration and HHS have delayed the implementation or published rules rescinding some of these Trump-era policies.
 
Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. Further, based on a recent executive order, the Biden administration expressed its intent to pursue certain policy initiatives to reduce drug prices. The HHS has released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. While no legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles, Congress is considering legislation that, if passed, could have significant impact on prices of prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including limitations on drug price increases and allowing Medicare to negotiate pricing for certain covered drug products. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved.
 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in the United States directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of health reform initiatives that may arise from future federal and state legislation or administrative action. If we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our product candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.
 
Facilities
 
Our offices are located in San Francisco and San Diego, California.  In San Francisco, we lease 5,698 square feet of office space, under a lease that expires on June 30, 2026, with an option to extend for an additional three years at the end of the initial term.  In San Diego, we occupy 8,088 square feet of office space under a lease which commenced in March 2022 for an initial term of five years and four months. We believe that our facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
 
 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Highlights
 
 Social
 
 We are committed to driving social impact through our pipeline and operating in a way that is respectful and inclusive of all stakeholders. Below are a few examples that demonstrate our commitment to social impact:

• | Our mission is to expand the reach of targeted therapeutics by developing products that are designed to address significant unmet need for those battling cancer. Our two lead product candidates, KIN-2787 and KIN-3248, could impact over 100,000 prevalent patients and their caregivers. For example, for KIN-2787, patients with Class II or Class III alterations have no available targeted therapy treatment options today and for KIN-3248, patients who have been treated first-generation FGFR inhibitors often develop resistance to treatment, which shortens their duration of response. We estimate that each month of life extension for patients could lead to a risk adjusted lifetime value of over $1 billion for both programs. Further, caregivers of cancer patients are typically forced to significantly change their lives in order to provide care, which can lead to increased psychological morbidity and economic burden. Approximately 50% of caregivers experience severe decline of quality of life. Providing new treatment options for patients who are currently underserved could improve caregivers’ quality of life.
