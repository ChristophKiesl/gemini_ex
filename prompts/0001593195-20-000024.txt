Item 1. Business
Overview
Tribune Publishing Company was formed as a Delaware corporation on November 21, 2013. Tribune Publishing Company, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Tribune”), is a media company rooted in award-winning journalism. Headquartered in Chicago, Tribune operates local media businesses in eight markets with titles including the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, The Baltimore Sun, Orlando Sentinel, South Florida’s Sun Sentinel, Virginia’s Daily Press and The Virginian-Pilot, The Morning Call of Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania and the Hartford Courant. Tribune also operates Tribune Content Agency (“TCA”) and is the majority owner of BestReviews LLC (“BestReviews”).
On May 23, 2018, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of forsalebyowner.com and on June 18, 2018, the Company completed the sale of the Los Angeles Times, The San Diego Union-Tribune and various other titles of the Company’s California properties (“California Properties”). In connection with the sales of forsalebyowner.com and the California Properties, the Company entered into transition service agreements with the buyers. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on dispositions and related discontinued operations.
Tribune’s continuing legacy of brands have earned a combined 61 Pulitzer Prizes and are committed to informing, inspiring and engaging local communities. Tribune’s brands create and distribute content across its media portfolio, offering integrated marketing, media and business services to consumers and advertisers, including digital solutions and advertising opportunities.
The Company’s results of operations, when examined on a quarterly basis, reflect the seasonality of Tribune’s revenues. Second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are typically higher than first and third quarter revenues. Results for the second quarter reflect spring advertising revenues, while the fourth quarter includes advertising revenues related to the holiday season.

Segments
The Company manages its business as two distinct segments, M and X. Segment M is comprised of the Company’s media groups excluding their digital revenues and related digital expenses, except digital subscription revenues when bundled with a print subscription. Segment X includes the Company’s digital revenues and related digital expenses from local Tribune websites, third-party and affiliate websites, mobile applications, digital only subscriptions, TCA and BestReviews.
Segment M
Segment M’s media groups include the Chicago Tribune Media Group, the New York Daily News Media Group, The Baltimore Sun Media Group, the Orlando Sentinel Media Group, the Sun Sentinel Media Group, the Virginia Media Group, the Morning Call Media Group and the Hartford Courant Media Group. The Virginia Media Group includes the Daily Press and The Virginian-Pilot. Tribune’s major daily newspapers have served their respective communities with local, regional, national and international news and information for more than 150 years. The Hartford Courant is the nation’s oldest continuously published newspaper and celebrated its 255th anniversary in October 2019.
In the year ended December 29, 2019, 43.0% of segment M’s operating revenues were generated from the sale of newspapers and other owned publications to individual subscribers or to sales outlets that resell the newspapers. 39.3% of segment M’s operating revenues were derived from advertising. These revenues were generated from the sale of advertising space in published issues of the newspapers and from the delivery of preprinted advertising supplements. The remaining 17.7% of operating revenues for the year ended December 29, 2019, were generated from the provision of commercial printing and delivery services to other newspapers, direct mail advertising and services and other related activities.
Newspaper print advertising is typically in the form of display, classified or preprint advertising. Advertising and marketing services revenues are comprised of three basic categories: retail, national and classified. Retail is a category of customers who generally do business directly with the general public. National is a category of customers who generally do business directly with other businesses. Classified is a type of advertising which is other than display or preprint.
Circulation revenue results from the sale of print editions of newspapers to individual subscribers and to sales outlets that resell the newspapers.
Other revenues are derived from commercial printing and delivery services provided to other newspapers, direct mail advertising and services and other related activities. The Company contracts with a number of national and local newspapers to both print and distribute their respective publications in local markets where the Company is a newspaper publisher. The Company currently distributes national newspapers (including The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal) in its local markets under multiple agreements. In some instances where it prints publications, it also manages and procures newsprint, ink and plates on their behalf. These arrangements allow the Company to leverage its investment in infrastructure in those markets that support its own publications. As a result, these arrangements tend to contribute incremental profitability and revenues. To provide delivery services to other newspapers, the Company contracts with independent third-party delivery vendors and generally does not provide such services directly.

Segment M’s product mix consists of three publication types: (i) daily newspapers, (ii) weekly newspapers and (iii) niche publications and direct mail. The key characteristics of each of these types of publications are summarized in the table below.

Competition 
Each of the Company’s nine major daily newspapers holds a leading market position in their respective designated market areas as determined by Nielsen, and competes for readership and advertising with both local or community newspapers as well as national newspapers and other traditional and web-based media sources. Increasingly, the Company is facing competition from digital platforms that have content, search, aggregation and social media functionality, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, over-the-top video services, radio, direct mail, yellow pages, outdoor, and other media as advertisers adjust their spending based on the perceived value of the audience reached and the cost to reach that audience.  Over time, less competition for advertising dollars is coming from the traditional local, regional and national newspapers.
The secular shift of how content is consumed, including the ubiquity of mobile platforms, has led to increased competition from a wide variety of new digital content offerings, many of which are often free to users. Besides price, variables impacting customer acquisition and retention include the quality and nature of the user experience and the quality of the content offered.
To address the structural shift to digital media, the Company provides editorial content on a wide variety of platforms and formats - from the printed daily newspaper to the Company’s leading local websites; on social network sites such as Facebook, Apple News and Twitter; on smartphones, tablets and e-readers; on websites and blogs; in niche online publications and in e-mail newsletters.
Raw Materials
As a publisher of newspapers, Tribune utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. During 2019, we consumed approximately 118 thousand metric tons of newsprint. Our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices. The Company currently obtains substantially all of its newsprint under a long-term contract with a national purchasing aggregator who then draws upon U.S. and internationally based newsprint producers. We believe that our current source of paper supply is adequate. Newsprint and ink expense accounted for 5.8% of total operating expenses in the year ended December 29, 2019.
Employees
As of December 29, 2019, we had approximately 4,114 full-time and part-time employees, including approximately 1,422 employees represented by various employee unions. We believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
Intellectual Property
Currently, our operations are generally not reliant on patents owned by third parties. However, because we operate a large number of websites and mobile applications in high-visibility markets, we do defend patent litigation, from time to time, brought primarily by non-practicing entities, as opposed to marketplace competitors. We have sought patent protection in certain instances; however, we do not consider patents to be material to our business as a whole. Of greater 
importance to our overall business are the federal, international and state trademark registrations and applications that protect, along with our common law rights, our brands, certain of which are long-standing and well known, such as Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News and Hartford Courant. Generally, the duration of a trademark registration is perpetual if it is renewed on a timely basis and continues to be used properly as a trademark. We also own a large number of copyrights, none of which individually is material to the business. We maintain certain licensing and content sharing relationships with third-party content providers that allow us to produce the particular content mix we provide to our customers in our markets. The Company entered into a number of agreements with Tribune Media Company, formerly Tribune Company, or its subsidiaries (collectively, “TCO”) that provide for licenses to certain intellectual property, and in particular, we entered into a license agreement with TCO that provides a non-exclusive, royalty-free license for us to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names, including the Tribune name. Other than the foregoing and commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses to third-party intellectual property are material to our business as a whole.
