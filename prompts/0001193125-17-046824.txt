Products, Services, Markets, and Competition 
 The Companys products and preservation services are used to treat a variety of medical conditions. A discussion of each market in which the Company competes and a description of the Companys products and/or services that compete within each market are discussed below. 
 The Company faces competition from several domestic and international medical device, pharmaceutical, and biopharmaceutical companies and from both for profit and non-profit tissue banks. Many of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial and personnel resources than the Company. These competitors may also have greater experience in developing products, procuring tissues, conducting clinical trials, and obtaining regulatory approvals and may have large contracts with hospitals under which they can impose purchase requirements that place the Companys products at a disadvantage. Certain of these competitors may obtain patent protection or approval or clearance by the FDA or foreign regulators earlier than the Company. The Company may also compete with companies that have superior manufacturing efficiency, tissue processing capacity, and/or marketing capabilities. Additional competitive products may be under development which could compete with the Companys products or services in the future. There can be no assurance that the Companys current or future competitors will not succeed in developing alternative technologies, products, or services that have significant advantages over those that have been, or are being, developed by the Company or that would render the Companys products or technology obsolete and non-competitive. Any of these competitive disadvantages could materially, adversely affect the Company. Specific competitive products currently on the market are discussed in the sections below. 
 Surgical Sealants 
 Closing internal wounds effectively following surgical procedures is critical to the restoration of the function of tissue and to the ultimate success of the surgical procedure. Failure to seal surgical wounds effectively can result in leakage of blood in cardiac surgeries, air in lung surgeries, cerebrospinal fluid in neurosurgeries, and gastrointestinal contents in abdominal surgeries. Fluid, air, and content leakage resulting from surgical procedures can lead to prolonged hospitalization, higher levels of post-operative pain, higher costs, and a higher mortality rate. 
 Sutures and staples facilitate healing by joining wound edges to allow the body to heal naturally. However, sutures and staples cannot consistently eliminate air and fluid leakage at the wound site, particularly when used to close tissues containing air or fluids under pressure, such as in blood vessels, the lobes of the lung, the dural membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and the gastrointestinal tract. In some cases, the tissues may be friable, which complicates the ability to achieve closure. In addition, it can be difficult and time consuming for the physician to apply sutures and staples in minimally invasive surgical procedures where the physician must operate through small access openings. The Company believes that the use of surgical adhesives and sealants with, or without, sutures and staples could enhance the efficacy of these procedures through more effective and rapid wound closure. In order to address the inherent limitations of sutures and staples, the Company developed and commercialized its protein hydrogel technology (PHT) platform. The PHT platform is based on a bovine protein that mirrors an array of amino acids that perform complex functions in the human body. Together with a cross-linker, the protein forms a hydrogel, a water-based biomaterial somewhat similar to human tissue. Materials and implantable replacement devices created with PHT may have the potential to provide structure, form, and function similar to certain human tissues. CryoLife developed and currently markets the surgical sealants BioGlue and BioFoam from its PHT platform. 
 BioGlue 
 CryoLifes proprietary product, BioGlue, is a polymer consisting of bovine blood protein and an agent for cross-linking proteins, which was developed for use in cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, and general surgical applications. BioGlue has a tensile strength that is four to five times that of fibrin sealants, and it is stronger than other cardiovascular sealants. BioGlue begins to polymerize within 20 to 30 seconds and reaches its bonding strength within two minutes. BioGlue is dispensed by a controlled delivery system that consists of a disposable syringe, which may be used with, or without, a multi-use delivery device, and various applicator tips. BioGlue is pre-filled in 2ml, 5ml, and 10ml volumes. Applicator tips are available in standard size, 12mm and 16mm spreader tips, 10cm and 27cm flexible extender tips, and 10cm, 27cm, and 35cm delivery tip extenders. 
 BioGlue is FDA approved as an adjunct to sutures and staples for use in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels. CryoLife distributes BioGlue under Conformité Européene Mark product certification (CE Mark) in the EEA for repair of soft tissues (which include cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, and additional soft tissues). CryoLife also distributes BioGlue in Japan which is indicated for adhesion and support of hemostasis for aortotomy closure sites, suture/anastomosis sites (including aortic dissection and anastomosis sites with use of a prosthetic graft), and suture sites on the heart. Additional marketing approvals have been granted for specified applications in several other countries throughout the world. 
 
6 
 
CryoLife distributes BioGlue throughout the U.S. and in approximately 80 other countries. Revenues from BioGlue represented 35%, 40%, and 43% of total Company revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 The Companys BioGlue product competes primarily with sealants from Baxter International, Inc., Ethicon, Inc. (a Johnson & Johnson Company), Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, C.R. Bard, Inc. (Bard), and Mallinckrodt PLC. The Companys BioGlue competes with these products based on its benefits and features, such as strength and ease of use. 
 BioFoam 
 CryoLifes proprietary product, BioFoam, is a protein hydrogel biomaterial with an expansion agent, which generates a mixed-cell foam. The foam creates a mechanical barrier to decrease blood flow and develops pores for the blood to enter, leading to cellular aggregation and enhanced hemostasis. BioFoam was developed to seal organs, such as the liver, rapidly and for use in cardiovascular surgeries, and may provide hemostasis in penetrating wounds and trauma. It is easily applied and could potentially be used intra-operatively to control internal organ hemorrhage, limit blood loss, and reduce the need for future re-operations in liver resections. 
 CryoLife distributes BioFoam in Europe under a CE Mark for use as an adjunct in the sealing of abdominal parenchymal tissues (liver and spleen) and as an adjunct to hemostasis in cardiovascular surgery when cessation of bleeding by ligature or other conventional methods is ineffective or impractical. 
 CryoLife distributes BioFoam in approximately 45 countries, primarily in Europe. Revenues from BioFoam represented less than 1% of total Company revenues in each of 2016, 2015, and 2014. 
 The Companys BioFoam product competes with sealants from Pfizer, Inc., Baxter International, Inc., Ethicon, Inc., Bard, and Orthovita, Inc. The Companys BioFoam product competes on the basis of its clinical efficacy and ease of use. 
 Cardiac Repair and Reconstruction 
 Patients with congenital cardiac defects such as Tetralogy of Fallot, Truncus Arteriosis, and Pulmonary Atresia can require complex cardiac reconstructive surgery to repair the defect. Patients with heart disease can experience valve insufficiency, regurgitation, or stenosis that may require heart valve repair or replacement surgery. Cardiac surgery can include the implantation of mechanical heart valves, bioprosthetic (animal-derived or xenograft) tissues, synthetic tissues, or donated human tissues. 
 Mechanical heart valves are durable and are often a solution that will last for the remainder of a patients life without replacement. Mechanical valves are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a valve replacement. These valves contain a synthetic sewing ring to facilitate implantation. Patients who receive mechanical heart valves are required to undergo long-term blood thinning or anticoagulation drug therapy to minimize the risk of complications from blood clots. 
 Bioprosthetic tissues, including bovine, equine, or porcine tissue values, are available in heart valves and surgical patches. Bioprosthetic valves are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a valve replacement. Bioprosthetic heart valves usually have a life of 7 to 20 years, after which a degenerating valve must be replaced, which can be a significant concern for younger patient populations. Bioprosthetic tissues are typically processed with glutaraldehyde, which may result in progressive calcification, or hardening of the tissue over time. These valves often contain a synthetic sewing ring to facilitate implantation. Patients receiving a bioprosthetic heart valve may not require long-term anticoagulation drug therapy, although certain of these patients may require anticoagulation drug therapy for other heart or vascular conditions. 
 Synthetic surgical patches are available for use in cardiac repair and synthetic materials are used in sewing rings for mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves. These synthetic sewing rings may harbor bacteria and lead to endocarditis, which can be difficult to treat with antibiotics. Patients with an infected mechanical or bioprosthetic valve may require valve replacement. 
 
7 
 
Human heart valves are available for use in valve replacement procedures. Human heart valves allow for more normal blood flow and often provide higher cardiac output than mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves. Human tissue responds better to treatment for infections, such as endocarditis and is not as susceptible to progressive calcification as glutaraldehyde-fixed bioprosthetic tissues. Human heart valves do not require anticoagulation drug therapy, as do mechanical valves. Human tissue patches are also available for use in cardiac repair and human vascular tissues are used in cardiac bypass surgery. However, the transplant of any human tissue that has not been preserved must be accomplished within extremely short time limits. Cryopreservation, or cooling and storing at extremely cold temperatures, expands the treatment options available by extending these timelines. 
 The 2013 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Guidelines, (the Guidelines) as published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery, have increased the indication (from Class II to Class I) and broadened the scope for using a human heart valve during aortic valve replacement surgery due to endocarditis. This means that when endocarditis has functionally destroyed the aortic valve annulus, an aortic homograft is the recommended course of treatment. Previously, the Guidelines indication for aortic homograft use was Class II, which meant only that it was an acceptable course of treatment. Consequently, for many physicians, human heart valves are the preferred alternative to animal-derived and mechanical valves for patients who have, or are at risk to contract, endocarditis. 
 CryoLife currently markets the On-X aortic and mitral mechanical heart valves for valve replacement procedures and PhotoFix for cardiac repair. CryoLife also markets its cardiac preservation services, including its CryoValve and CryoValve SG tissues for heart valve replacement surgeries and its CryoPatch and CryoPatch SG tissues for cardiac repair procedures. 
 On-X Heart Valves 
 The On-X catalogue of products includes the On-X prosthetic aortic and mitral heart valve and the On-X ascending aortic prosthesis (AAP). The Company also distributes CarbonAid CO2 diffusion catheters, manufactures Chord-X ePTFE sutures for mitral chordal replacement, and offers pyrolytic carbon coating services to other medical device manufacturers as part of the On-X family of products. 
 The On-X heart valve is a bileaflet mechanical valve composed of a graphite substrate coated with On-Xs pyrolytic carbon coating. The On-X heart valve is available for both aortic and mitral indications and with a variety of sewing ring options to suit physicians preferences. The On-X AAP is an On-X aortic valve combined with a Vascutek Gelweave ValsalvaTM Graft to allow physicians to more conveniently treat patients requiring both an aortic valve replacement and an aortic graft. 
 As discussed above, all mechanical valve patients require anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, which creates a risk of harmful bleeding. The On-X aortic heart valve is the only mechanical valve U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to be marketed as, and clinically proven to be, safer with use by the patient of less warfarin. In a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing reduced warfarin to standard warfarin dose in On-X aortic heart valve patients, the reduced warfarin dose group had 65% fewer harmful bleeding events without an increase in stroke risk. 
 The On-X heart valve is FDA approved for the replacement of diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning native or prosthetic heart valves in the aortic and mitral positions, and is classified as a Class III medical device. On-X distributes the On-X heart valve under CE Mark in the EEA. Additional marketing approvals have been granted in several other countries throughout the world. 
 CryoLife began distribution of On-X heart valves throughout the U.S. and in approximately 95 other countries in January 2016 when it acquired On-X. Revenues from On-X products represented 19% of total Company revenues in 2016. 
 The Companys On-X heart valves compete primarily with mechanical valves from Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic, Inc., and LivaNova PLC based on the On-X heart valves benefits and features, such as the lower warfarin requirement for aortic valves and low turbulence and increased thromboresistance. 
 PhotoFix 
 In 2014 CryoLife entered into an exclusive supply and distribution agreement with Genesee Biomedical, Inc. (GBI) to acquire the distribution rights to PhotoFix, a bovine pericardial patch stabilized using a dye-mediated photo-fixation process that requires no glutaraldehyde. On April 13, 2016 the Company exercised its right to acquire the PhotoFix technology from GBI and is in the process of transferring manufacturing of PhotoFix to the Companys headquarters facilities. PhotoFix has FDA 510(k) clearance and is indicated for use in intracardiac repair, including ventricular repair and atrial repair, great vessel repair and suture line buttressing, and pericardial closure. 
 
8 
 
In January 2015 the Company received its initial shipments and launched its distribution of PhotoFix in the U.S. Revenues from PhotoFix represented approximately 1% of total Company revenues in each of 2016 and 2015. 
 Cardiac Preservation Services 
 The Companys proprietary preservation process involves dissection, processing, preservation, and storage of tissues by the Company, until they are shipped to an implanting physician. The cardiac tissues currently preserved by the Company include aortic and pulmonary heart valves and cardiac patches in three primary anatomic configurations: pulmonary hemi-artery, pulmonary trunk, and pulmonary branch. Each of these tissues maintains a structure which more closely resembles and simulates the performance of the patients own tissue compared to non-human tissue alternatives. The Companys cardiac tissues have been used in a variety of valve replacement and cardiac reconstruction surgeries. Management believes the human tissues it distributes offer specific advantages over mechanical, synthetic, and bioprosthetic alternatives. Depending on the alternative, the advantages of the Companys heart valves include more natural blood flow properties, the ability to use the valve with patients who have endocarditis, the elimination of a need for long-term drug therapy to prevent excessive blood clotting, and a reduced risk of catastrophic failure, thromboembolism (stroke), or calcification. 
 The Companys cardiac tissues include the CryoValve SGPV and the CryoPatch SG, both processed with the Companys proprietary SynerGraft decellularization technology. A multi-center study showed that at 10 years, patients with the Companys proprietary SynerGraft valves had a 17 percent re-operation rate, as compared to a 40 percent re-operation rate for patients with non-SynerGraft valves. CryoLife uses the SynerGraft technology for a significant portion of its pulmonary valve and pulmonary cardiac patch tissue processing. 
 CryoLife distributes human cardiac tissues to implanting institutions throughout the U.S. The Companys CryoValve SGPV and CryoPatch SG are distributed under 510(k) clearance from the FDA. CryoLife also distributes tissues in Canada and has limited distribution through a special access program in Germany. 
 Revenues from cardiac tissue preservation services accounted for 17%, 19%, and 20% of total Company revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 Management believes that at least one domestic tissue bank, LifeNet Health, Inc. (LifeNet), offers preserved human heart valves and patches in competition with the Company. Alternatives to human heart valves processed by the Company include valve repair and valve replacement with bioprosthetic valves or mechanical valves. The Company competes with bioprosthetic or mechanical valves from companies including Medtronic, Inc., Edwards Life Sciences, Inc., LivaNova, and Abbott Laboratories. Alternatives to the Companys human cardiac patches include xenograft small intestine submucosa (SIS) and glutaraldehyde fixed bovine pericardial patches. The Company competes with xenograft and SIS products from companies including CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc., Edwards Life Sciences, Inc., Admedus, Inc., Abbott Laboratories, and Synovis Surgical Innovations. 
 Management believes that the human heart valves preserved by the Company compare favorably with bioprosthetic and mechanical valves, for certain indications and patient populations, and that the human cardiac patches preserved by the Company compare favorably with xenograft SIS and glutaraldehyde fixed bovine pericardial patches, due to the benefits of human tissue discussed above. In addition, human tissue is the preferred replacement alternative with respect to certain medical conditions, such as pediatric cardiac reconstruction, congenital cardiac defect repair, valve replacements for women in their child-bearing years, and valve replacements for patients with endocarditis. In addition, implantation of the SynerGraft treated cardiac tissue reduces the risk for induction of class I and class II alloantibodies, based on Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) measured at up to one year, compared to standard processed cardiac tissues. The Company believes that this may provide a competitive advantage for CryoValve SGPV and CryoPatch SG for patients that may later require a whole organ transplant, as an increased PRA can decrease the number of possible donors for subsequent organ transplants and increase time on transplant waiting lists. 
 Management believes that it competes with other entities that preserve human tissue on the basis of the preference of surgeons, documented clinical data, technology, customer service, and quality assurance. Management believes the Company offers advantages in the areas of clinical data and customer service, particularly with respect to the capabilities of our field representatives, as compared to other human tissue processors.

Vascular Repair and Reconstruction 
 Patients with peripheral vascular disease can experience reduced blood flow, usually in the arms and legs. This can result in poor circulation, pain, and sores that do not heal. Failure to achieve revascularization of an obstructed vessel may result in the loss of a limb or even death of the patient. When patients require peripheral bypass surgery, the surgeons first choice generally is a graft of the patients own tissue (autograft). However, in cases of advanced vascular disease, patients may not have suitable vascular tissue for transplantation. Other artery and vascular repair procedures include infected abdominal aortic grafts, insufficient vascular access, carotid endarterectomy, or vessel repair. These procedures may include the use of bioprosthetic patches, synthetic grafts or patches, or donated human vascular tissues. Alternative treatments may include the repair, partial removal, or complete removal of the damaged tissue. 
 Bioprosthetic vascular grafts and patches, including those made of bovine or porcine tissue, can be used for a variety of vascular repair procedures. Bioprosthetic grafts are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a vascular repair procedure. Bioprosthetic tissues are typically processed with glutaraldehyde, which may result in progressive calcification, or hardening of the tissue over time. 
 Synthetic vascular grafts and patches can be used for a variety of vascular repair procedures. Synthetic grafts are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a vascular repair procedure. However, synthetic grafts and patches are generally not suitable for use in infected areas because they may harbor bacteria and are difficult to treat with antibiotics. Synthetic vascular grafts have a tendency to obstruct over time, particularly in below-the-knee surgeries. 
 Human vascular tissues tend to respond better to treatment for infection and remain open and accessible for longer periods of time and, as such, are used in indications where synthetic grafts typically fail, such as in infected areas and for below-the-knee surgeries. Human vascular and arterial tissues are also used in a variety of other reconstruction procedures such as cardiac bypass surgery and as vascular access grafts for hemodialysis. The transplant of human tissue that has not been preserved must be accomplished within extremely short time limits. Cryopreservation, or cooling and storing at extremely cold temperatures, expands the treatment options available by extending these timelines. 
 CryoLife currently markets its vascular preservation services, including its CryoVein® and CryoArtery® tissues for vascular reconstruction surgeries. 
 Vascular Preservation Services 
 The Companys proprietary preservation process involves dissection, processing, preservation, and storage of tissues by the Company, until they are shipped to an implanting physician. The vascular tissues currently preserved by the Company include saphenous veins, aortoilliac arteries, and femoral veins and arteries. Each of these tissues maintains a structure, which more closely resembles and simulates the performance of the patients own tissue compared to non-human tissue alternatives. The Companys vascular tissues have been used to treat a variety of vascular reconstructions, such as peripheral bypass, hemodialysis access, and aortic infections, which have saved the lives and limbs of patients. Management believes the human tissues it distributes offer specific advantages over mechanical, synthetic, and bioprosthesis alternatives. 
 CryoLife distributes human vascular tissues to implanting institutions throughout the U.S. CryoLife also distributes tissues in Canada and has limited distribution through a special access program in Germany. 
 Revenues from vascular preservation services accounted for 20%, 24%, and 23% of total Company revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 Management believes that at a small number of domestic tissue banks, including LifeNet, LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. (LeMaitre), and Vascular Transplant Services, offer vascular tissue in competition with the Company. There are also a number of providers of synthetic alternatives to veins preserved by the Company and those alternatives are available primarily in medium and large diameters. The Companys vascular tissues compete with products from Gore, Bard, Artegraft, Inc., LeMaitre, and Maquet, Inc. 
 Management believes that it competes with other entities that preserve human tissue on the basis of the preference of surgeons, documented clinical data, technology, and customer service. Management believes the Company offers advantages in the areas of clinical data and customer service, particularly with respect to the capabilities of our field representatives, as compared to the sales organizations of other human tissue processors.

Angina Treatment 
 Angina consists of pressure, discomfort, and/or pain in the chest typically due to narrowed or blocked arteries, resulting in ischemic heart disease. Patients with severe angina are often treated with surgical procedures including angioplasty or coronary artery bypass or with medications such as aspirin, nitrates, beta-blockers, statins, or calcium channel blockers. Pain may be chronic or may become pronounced with exercise. Angina can also be treated with Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR), a procedure that can be performed as an open surgical procedure or through a minimally invasive surgery either as a stand-alone procedure or concurrently with coronary artery bypass. During TMR, the surgeon uses a disposable handpiece to deliver precise bursts of laser energy directly to an area of heart muscle that is suffering from ischemic heart disease through a small incision or small ports with the patient under general anesthesia and without stopping the heart. TMR is typically performed with a CO2 or Holmium: YAG laser. It takes approximately 6 to 10 pulses of the laser to traverse the myocardium and create channels of one millimeter in diameter. During a typical procedure, approximately 20 to 40 channels are made in the heart muscle. The external openings seal with little blood loss. Angina usually subsides with improved oxygen supply to the targeted areas of the damaged heart muscle. CryoLife currently sells the CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line to perform TMR. 
CardioGenesis Cardiac Laser Therapy 
 CryoLifes CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line consists of Holmium: YAG laser consoles, related service and maintenance, and single-use, fiber-optic handpieces, which are used in TMR to treat patients with severe angina resulting from diffuse coronary artery disease. Patients undergoing TMR treatment with CardioGenesis products have been shown to have angina reduction, longer event-free survival, reduction in cardiac related hospitalizations, and increased exercise tolerance. CryoLifes SolarGen 2100s Console (Console) uses the solid-state technology of the Holmium: YAG laser system to provide a stable and reliable energy platform that is designed to deliver precise energy output. The Console has an advanced electronic and cooling system technology, which allows for a smaller and lighter system, while providing 115V power capability. The Company also provides service plan options to ensure that the Console is operating within the critical factory specifications. CryoLife distributes the SoloGrip® III disposable handpieces, which consist of multiple, fine fiber-optic strands in a one millimeter diameter bundle and are designed to work with the Console. The SoloGrip III handpiece has an ergonomic design and is pre-calibrated in the factory to provide easy and convenient access for treating all regions of the left ventricle. 
 The CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line is FDA approved for treating patients with severe angina that is not responsive to conventional therapy. CryoLife began distributing the CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line, primarily in the U.S., in May 2011 when it completed the acquisition of Cardiogenesis Corporation. Although the CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line has a CE Mark allowing commercial distribution into the EEA, CryoLife does not actively market the product line internationally. 
 CryoLife distributes handpieces and CardioGenesis laser consoles primarily in the U.S. Revenues from CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy represented 5%, 6%, and 6% of total Company revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 The Companys CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy competes with other methods for the treatment of coronary artery disease, including drug therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass surgery, and enhanced external counterpulsation. Currently, the only directly competitive laser technology for the performance of TMR is the CO2 Heart Laser System manufactured by Novadaq Technologies, Inc. The Companys revascularization technology competes on the basis of its ease of use, versatility, size of laser console, and improved access to the treatment area with a smaller fiber-optic system. 
 Hemostats 
 Hemostatic agents are frequently utilized as an adjunct to sutures and staples to control inter-operative bleeding. Hemostatic agents prevent excess blood loss and can help maintain good visibility of the operative site. These products may reduce operating room time and decrease the number of blood transfusions required in surgical procedures. Hemostatic agents are available in various forms including pads, sponges, liquids, and powders. CryoLife currently markets the hemostatic agent PerClot. 
 
11 
 
PerClot 
PerClot is an absorbable powdered hemostat, consisting of plant starch modified into ultra-hydrophilic, adhesive-forming hemostatic polymers. PerClot granules are biocompatible, absorbable polysaccharides containing no animal or human components. The purified plant source material helps to minimize the risks of infection and bleeding-related complications during surgery. PerClot granules have a molecular structure that rapidly absorbs water, forming a gelled adhesive matrix that provides a mechanical barrier to any further bleeding and results in the accumulation of platelets, red blood cells, and coagulation proteins (thrombin, fibrinogen, etc.) at the site of application. This gelled adhesive matrix promotes the normal physiological clotting cascade. PerClot does not require additional operating room preparation or special storage conditions and is easy to apply. PerClot is readily dissolved by saline irrigation and is totally absorbed by the body within several days. PerClot is currently available in 1 gram, 3 gram, and 5 gram configurations with a 100mm or 200mm applicator tip for certain sizes. PerClot Laparoscopic is available in a 3 gram configuration with a 380mm applicator tip. In September 2010 CryoLife entered into a distribution agreement and a license and manufacturing agreement with SMI, which allows CryoLife to distribute PerClot worldwide, except in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, North Korea, Iran, and Syria. 
 PerClot has a CE Mark allowing commercial distribution into the EEA and other markets. PerClot is indicated for use in surgical procedures, including cardiac, vascular, orthopaedic, neurological, gynecological, ENT, and trauma surgery as an adjunct hemostat when control of bleeding from capillary, venular, or arteriolar vessels by pressure, ligature, and other conventional means is either ineffective or impractical. CryoLife distributes PerClot in Europe and other international countries. 
 CryoLife has received approval to begin clinical trials for the purpose of obtaining FDA Premarket Approval (PMA) to distribute PerClot in the U.S., as discussed further in Research and Development and Clinical Research below. 
 CryoLife distributes PerClot in approximately 60 countries. Revenues from PerClot represented 2%, 3%, and 3% of total Company revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 The Companys PerClot product competes with various hemostats including thrombin products from Pfizer, Inc., Mallinckrodt PLC, and Ethicon, Inc., and surgical hemostats from Pfizer, Inc., Bard, Baxter International, Inc., Ethicon, Inc., and BioCer Entwicklungs-GmbH. Other competitive products may include argon beam coagulators, which provide an electrical source of hemostasis. A number of companies have surgical hemostat products under development. The Companys PerClot Topical product competes with many of the same products listed above, but also competes with products from Medtronic, Inc., Polyganics B.V., and Hemostasis, LLC, as well as gauze and chemical cauterization. The Companys PerClot product competes on the basis of safety, clinical efficacy, absorption rates, and ease of use. 
 Vascular Access 
 ESRD refers to the stage of renal disease when the kidneys do not work well enough for the patient to live without dialysis or transplant. Patients with ESRD often undergo hemodialysis through an access site. CryoLife markets its CryoVein femoral vein and CryoArtery femoral artery vascular preservation services for vascular access and previously marketed the HeRO Graft and ProCol for vascular access. 
 HeRO Graft and ProCol 
 CryoLife began distributing the HeRO Graft in the U.S. in May 2012 when it acquired Hemosphere, Inc. and distributed the product until the Company divested the product line in February 2016. CryoLife distributed the HeRO Graft in the U.S. and approximately 40 other countries. Revenues from the HeRO Graft represented 1%, 5%, and 5% of total Company revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 CryoLife began distributing ProCol in the U.S. in March 2014 under a distribution agreement with Hancock Jaffe and distributed the product until the Company divested the product line in March 2016. Revenues from ProCol represented less than 1% of total Company revenues in each of 2016, 2015, and 2014. 
 Marketing and Distribution 
 In the U.S. the Company markets its products and preservation services primarily to physicians, and distributes its products through its direct sales team to hospitals and other healthcare facilities. The Company also has a team of region managers, national accounts manager, and sales and marketing management. Through its field representatives, the Company conducts field training for surgeons regarding the surgical applications of its products and tissues. 
 CryoLifes physician relations and education staff, clinical research staff, and field representatives assist physicians by providing educational materials, seminars, and clinics on methods for using Company products and implanting tissue preserved by the Company. The Company sponsors programs where surgeons train other surgeons in best-demonstrated 
 
12 
 
 techniques. In addition, the Company hosts several workshops throughout the year including On-X Training Workshops, Chord-X Training Workshops, Aortic Allograft Workshops, Aortic Valve and Root Bootcamp, Ross Master Course and TMR Workshops. These workshops aim to provide didactic and hands-on training to surgeons. The Company also produces educational videos for physicians and coordinates peer-to-peer training at various medical institutions. Management believes that these activities enhance the medical communitys acceptance of the products and tissues offered by the Company and help to differentiate the Company from other medical device companies and tissue processors. To assist organ and tissue procurement organizations (OTPOs), the Company provides educational materials and training on procurement, dissection, packaging, and shipping techniques. The Company produces educational videos and coordinates laboratory sessions for OTPO personnel to improve their recovery techniques and increase the yield of usable tissue. The Company also maintains a staff 24 hours per day, 365 days per year for OTPO support. 
 The Company markets its products in the EMEA region through its European subsidiary, Europa, based in Guildford, England. Europa employs direct field service representatives in the U.K., Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Ireland and manages relationships with other independent distributors in the EMEA region. The Company employs direct field service representatives to market its products in France through its French subsidiary, CryoLife France. Europa and CryoLife France provide customer service, logistics, marketing, and clinical support to cardiac, vascular, thoracic, and general surgeons throughout the EMEA region. 
 The Company markets and distributes its products in other international markets through independent distributors in Canada, Asia Pacific, and the Americas. The Companys Singapore subsidiary, CryoLife Asia Pacific, provides sales and marketing support for the Asia Pacific region. 
 Suppliers, Sources, and Availability of Raw Materials and Tissues 
 The Company obtains many of its raw materials and supplies from a small group of suppliers or a single-source supplier. CryoLife also distributes various products through distribution agreements with the manufacturers. Certain raw materials and components used in the Companys products and tissue processing have stringent specifications. Supply interruptions or supplier quality, financial, or operational issues could cause the Company to have to temporarily reduce, temporarily halt, or permanently halt manufacturing, processing, or distribution activities. Qualifying alternative suppliers could result in additional costs or lengthy delays, or may not be possible. Any of these adverse outcomes could have a material, adverse effect on the Companys revenues or profitability. Supplies of materials are discussed for each of the Companys main products and services below. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 The Companys BioGlue and BioFoam products have three main product components: bovine protein, a cross linker, and a molded plastic resin delivery device. The bovine protein and cross linker are obtained from a small number of qualified suppliers. The delivery devices are manufactured by a single supplier, using resin supplied by a single resin supplier. The Company maintains a significant inventory of finished delivery devices to help mitigate the effects of a potential supply interruption. 
 The Company purchases grafts for its On-X AAP from a single supplier. The Company maintains an inventory of grafts to help mitigate the effects of a potential supply interruption. 
 The Company purchases laser consoles and handpieces for its CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line each from a separate single-source contract manufacturer. Using a secondary supplier for the laser consoles may be difficult because of certain of this manufacturers patent rights. In addition, these manufacturers obtain certain laser and fiber-optic components and subassemblies from single sources. CryoLifes business is subject to interruption if either of these contract manufacturers or their suppliers became unable or unwilling to do business with CryoLife. 
 The Company purchases PerClot from SMI pursuant to a distribution agreement. The Company maintains an inventory of PerClot purchased from SMI and places orders for additional product. CryoLifes business may be subject to interruption if SMI were unable or became unwilling to supply PerClot to CryoLife for a sustained period of time. 
 The Companys preservation services business and its ability to supply needed tissues is dependent upon donation of tissues from human donors by donor families. Donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by OTPOs. The Company must rely on the OTPOs that it works with to educate the public on the need for donation, to foster a willingness to donate tissue, to follow CryoLifes donor screening and procurement procedures, and to send donated tissue to CryoLife. Since 1984 the Company has received tissue from over 142,000 donors. The Company has active relationships with approximately 50 OTPOs throughout the U.S. Management believes these relationships are critical in the preservation services industry and that the breadth of these existing relationships provides the Company with a significant advantage over 
 
13 
 
 potential new entrants to this market. The Company also uses various raw materials, including medicines and solutions in its processing. Some of these raw materials are manufactured by single suppliers or by a small group of suppliers. All of these factors subject CryoLife to risk of supply interruption. 
 Operations, Manufacturing, and Tissue Preservation 
 The Company maintains a facility, which contains its corporate headquarters and laboratory space, and an additional off-site warehouse both located in Kennesaw, Georgia. The Company manufactures BioGlue and BioFoam and processes tissues at the Companys headquarters facility. The Company is also beginning to manufacture PerClot for use in the U.S. clinical trial, and is transferring manufacturing of PhotoFix to the Companys headquarters facility. The Companys corporate headquarters also includes a CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy maintenance and evaluation laboratory space. The Companys On-X facility consists of combined manufacturing, warehouse, and office space in Austin, Texas, where On-X products, including On-X heart valves and AAPs are manufactured. The Company maintains a facility of combined manufacturing and office space in Atlanta, Georgia, which is available for future manufacturing operations, and additional office space in Kennesaw, Georgia, which the Company currently sublets to a third party. The Companys European subsidiary, Europa, leases office space in Guildford, England, and shared warehousing space through its third-party shipper. See also Part I, Item 2, Properties. 
 In all of the Companys facilities, the Company is subject to regulatory standards for good manufacturing practices, including current Quality System Regulations, which are the FDA regulatory requirements for medical device manufacturers, and current Good Tissue Practices (cGTPs), which are the FDA regulatory requirements for the processing of human tissue. The Company also operates according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485 Quality System Requirements, an internationally recognized voluntary system of quality management for companies that design, develop, manufacture, distribute, and service medical devices. The Company maintains a Certification of Approval to the ISO 13485. The Company works with two Notified Bodies that are officially recognized by the EU to perform assessments of compliance with ISO 13485 and the Medical Device Directive. LNE/G-Med (G-Med) acts as the Companys Notified Body for the On-X product line, and Lloyds Register Quality Assurance Limited (LRQA) acts as the Companys Notified Body for the Companys other product lines. LRQA and G-Med perform periodic on-site inspections to review independently the Companys compliance with systems and regulatory requirements. The Medical Device Directive is the governing document for the EEA that details requirements for safety and risk. G-Med and LRQA also performs assessments of compliance with the Canadian Medical Devices Conformity Assessment System (CMDCAS). 
 The Company employs a comprehensive quality assurance program in its product manufacturing and tissue preservation activities. Materials, solutions, and components utilized in the Companys manufacturing and tissue processing are received and inspected by trained quality control personnel according to written specifications and standard operating procedures, and those items found to comply with Company standards are utilized in the Companys operations. Materials, components, sub-assemblies, and tissues are documented throughout manufacturing or processing to assure traceability. 
 The Company evaluates and inspects both its manufactured and distributed products to ensure conformity to product specifications. Processes are validated to produce products meeting the Companys specifications. Each process is documented along with inspection results, including final finished product inspection and acceptance. Records are maintained as to the consignees of products to track product performance and to facilitate product removals or corrections, if necessary. 
 The Company maintains controls over its tissue processing to ensure conformity with Company procedures. OTPOs must follow the Companys policies related to tissue recovery practices, and are subject to periodic audits to confirm compliance. Samples are taken from donated tissue for microbiological testing, and tissue must be shown to be free of certain detectable microbial contaminants before being released for distribution. Tissue processing records and donor information is reviewed to identify characteristics that would disqualify the tissue for processing or implantation. Once tissue is released for distribution, it is moved from quarantine to an implantable status. Tissue is stored by the Company until it is shipped to a hospital, where the tissue is thawed and implanted immediately or held in a liquid nitrogen freezer pending implantation. 
 Government Regulation 
 Medical devices and human tissues are subject to a number of regulations from various government bodies including in the U.S., federal, state, and local governments, as well as various regulatory bodies internationally. Government regulations are continually evolving, and requirements may change with or without notice. Changes in government regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing government regulations could have a material, adverse impact on the Company. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.

U.S. Federal Regulation of Medical Devices 
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) provides that, unless exempted by regulation, medical devices may not be distributed in the U.S. unless they have been approved or cleared for marketing by the FDA. Medical devices may receive such approval or clearance through either a 510(k) process or an investigational device exemption (IDE) and PMA process. 
 Under a Section 510(k) process, a medical device manufacturer provides a premarket notification that it intends to begin marketing a product and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed predicate product. To be found substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device must be for the same intended use and have either the same technological characteristics or different technological characteristics that do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness. In some cases, the submission must include data from clinical studies in order to demonstrate substantial equivalency to a predicate device. Marketing may commence when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding such substantial equivalence. 
 FDA regulations require approval through the IDE/PMA process for all Class III medical devices and for medical devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a predicate device. An IDE authorizes distribution of devices that lack PMA or 510(k) clearance for clinical evaluation purposes. After a product is subjected to clinical testing under an IDE, the Company may file a PMA application. Once a PMA application has been submitted, the FDAs review may be lengthy and may include requests for additional data, which may require the Company to undertake additional human clinical studies. Marketing of the device may begin when the FDA has approved the PMA. 
 FDCA requires all medical device manufacturers and distributors to register with the FDA annually and to provide the FDA with a list of those medical devices they distribute commercially. FDCA also requires manufacturers of medical devices to comply with labeling requirements and to manufacture devices in accordance with Quality System Regulations, which require that companies manufacture their products and maintain their documents in compliance with good manufacturing practices, including: design, document production, process, labeling and packaging controls, process validation, and other applicable quality control activities. The FDAs medical device reporting regulation requires that a device manufacturer provide information to the FDA on death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its products, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA further requires that certain medical devices that may not be sold in the U.S. follow certain procedures before they are exported. The FDA periodically inspects Company facilities to review Company compliance with these and other regulations and has authority to seize non-complying medical devices, enjoin and/or impose civil penalties on manufacturers and distributors marketing non-complying medical devices, criminally prosecute violators, and order recalls in certain instances. 
 The following Company products are, or would, upon approval, be classified as Class III medical devices: BioGlue, BioFoam, On-X heart valve, On-X AAP, PerClot, ProCol, and CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy. CryoPatch SG and HeRO Graft are classified as Class II medical devices. CryoLife obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market the CryoValve SGPV; however, these tissues are not officially classified as Class II or III medical devices. 
 In October 2014 the FDA convened an advisory committee meeting to consider the FDAs recommendation to reclassify more than minimally manipulated (MMM) allograft heart valves from an unclassified medical device to a Class III medical device. The class of MMM allograft heart valves includes our CryoValve SGPV. At the meeting, a majority of the advisory committee panel recommended to the FDA that MMM allograft heart valves be re-classified as a Class III product. If the FDA issues a proposal for reclassification of MMM allograft heart valves, it will be subject to a public comment period before finalization. After publication of the reclassification rule, the Company expects to have thirty months to submit for a PMA, after which the FDA will determine if, and for how long, the Company may continue to provide these tissues to customers. To date, the FDA has not issued a proposed reclassification for MMM allograft heart valves. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk FactorsRisks Relating To Our Business Reclassification by the FDA of CryoValve SGPV may make it commercially infeasible to continue processing the CryoValve SGPV.

U.S. Federal Regulation of Human Tissue 
 The FDA regulates human tissues pursuant to Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act, which in turn provides the regulatory framework for regulation of human cellular and tissue products. The FDA regulations focus on donor screening and testing to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of HIV-1 and -2, Hepatitis B and C, and other communicable diseases and disease agents. The regulations set minimum requirements to prevent the transmission of communicable diseases from human tissue used for transplantation. The regulations define human tissue as any tissue derived from a human body which is (i) intended for administration to another human for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease and (ii) recovered, preserved, stored, or distributed by methods not intended to change tissue function or characteristics. The FDA definition excludes, among other things, tissue that currently is regulated as a human drug, biological product, or medical device, and it also excludes kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, or any other vascularized human organ. The current regulations applicable to human tissues include requirements for donor suitability, processing standards, establishment registration, product listing, testing, and screening for risks of communicable diseases. The FDA periodically audits the Companys tissue preservation facilities for compliance with its requirements and has the authority to enjoin, force a recall, or require the destruction of tissues that do not meet its requirements. 
 NOTA Regulation 
 The Companys activities in preserving and transporting human hearts and certain other organs are also subject to federal regulation under the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce. NOTA excludes from the definition of valuable consideration reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of a human organ. The purpose of this statutory provision is to allow for compensation for legitimate services. The Company believes that to the extent its activities are subject to NOTA, it meets this statutory provision relating to the reasonableness of its charges. 
 State Licensing Requirements 
 Some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the manufacture, sale, or distribution of medical devices, and the Company believes it is in compliance with such applicable state laws and regulations. 
 Some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the preservation, transportation, and storage of human organs and tissues. The activities the Company engages in require it to be either licensed or registered as a clinical laboratory or tissue bank under California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Oregon law. The Company has such licenses or registrations, and the Company believes it is in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations relating to clinical laboratories and tissue banks that store, preserve, and distribute human tissue designed to be used for medical purposes in human beings. 
 Certain employees of the Company have obtained other required state licenses. The regulatory bodies of states may perform inspections of the Companys facilities as required to ensure compliance with state laws and regulations. 
 International Approval Requirements 
 Sales of medical devices and shipments of human tissues outside the U.S. are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of other countries must be obtained and compliance with applicable regulations for tissues must be met prior to commercial distribution of the products or human tissues in those countries. The time required to obtain these approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Countries in which CryoLife distributes products and tissue may perform inspections of the Company facilities to ensure compliance with local country regulations. 
 The EEA recognizes a single medical device approval, called a CE Mark, which allows for distribution of an approved product throughout the EEA without additional general applications in each country. However, individual EEA members reserve the right to require additional labeling or information to address particular patient safety issues prior to allowing marketing. Third-parties called Notified Bodies award the CE Mark. These Notified Bodies are approved and subject to review by the Competent Authorities of their respective countries. LRQA and G-Med perform periodic on-site inspections to review independently the Companys compliance with systems and regulatory requirements. A number of countries outside of the EEA accept the CE Mark in lieu of marketing submissions as an addendum to that countrys application process. The Company has been issued CE Marks for BioGlue, BioFoam, On-X heart valve, On-X AAP, and CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy consoles and handpieces. See Certifications, Accreditations, and Inspections below for further discussion of the On-X AAP CE Mark. Additionally, PerClot, which the Company distributes, has a CE Mark. 
 
16 
 
The EU Tissue and Cells Directives (EUTCD) established an approach to the regulation of tissues and cells across Europe. Pursuant to the EUTCD, each country in the EEA has responsibility for regulating tissues and cells and the procurement and distribution of tissues and cells for use in humans through a Competent Authority. The Competent Authority in the U.K. is the Human Tissue Authority (HTA). Europa was a Licensed Establishment under HTA Directions. In 2013 the HTA temporarily suspended Europas licenses but shortly thereafter reinstated them subject to certain conditions, which allowed Europa to continue importing tissues into Europe. Subsequently, the HTA imposed certain additional tissue processing requirements for tissues imported into Europe through the HTA license. Management did not believe those requirements were necessary in order to ensure the safety of the processed tissue, and, as a result, Europa ceased importing tissues into Europe through the HTA licenses as of March 31, 2014. 
 CryoLife currently distributes tissues through a special access program in Germany. In the first half of 2015 Germanys regulatory authorities and Europa were in discussions regarding requirements to allow Europa to market tissue in Germany. Europa was unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with the German authorities regarding those requirements, and although nominal shipments under the special access program have continued in 2016, there can be no assurance that the German authorities will continue to allow shipments of tissues under this program in the future. 
 Recent Regulatory Approvals 
 New country listings were obtained during 2016 to allow additional distribution of certain products into international markets, including PerClot and Cardiogenesis cardiac laser therapy products. 
 Certifications, Accreditations, and Inspections 
 In April 2016 the Korea Food & Drug Administration conducted a routine inspection of the Company. No observations were identified. 
 In August 2016 the American Association of Tissue Banks conducted an on-site inspection as part of their routine recertification process. Any minor nonconformities identified during the audit were subsequently resolved. 
 In September and October 2016 LRQA conducted a routine surveillance assessment to ISO 13485:2003 and Canadian CMDCAS requirements. Any minor nonconformities identified during the audit were subsequently resolved. 
 In November 2016 the Company received a notice from G-Med that it was suspending the CE Mark for the On-X AAP in the EEA until a previously submitted and approved remediation plan for this device was completed. The Company is in the process of completing the requirements of the remediation plan. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk FactorsRisks Relating To Our BusinessOur revenues for the On-X AAP in Europe may be adversely affected by a temporary suspension of the On-X AAPs CE-Mark for further discussion of the On-X AAPs European regulatory status. 
 All other registrations, licensures, certifications, and accreditations were renewed or continued, and no regulatory actions are pending from state inspections. 
 Backlog 
 The Company currently does not have a backlog of orders related to BioGlue, BioFoam, On-X heart valves, On-X AAPs, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy, PerClot, or PhotoFix. The limited supply of certain types or sizes of preserved tissue can result in a backlog of orders for these tissues. The amount of backlog fluctuates based on the tissues available for shipment and varies based on the surgical needs of specific cases. The Companys backlog of human tissue of more than $4 million consists mostly of pediatric tissues that have limited availability. The Companys backlog is generally not considered firm and must be confirmed with the customer before shipment. 
Research and Development and Clinical Research 
 The Company uses its technical and scientific expertise to identify market opportunities for new products or services or to expand the use of its current products and services, through expanded indications or product or tissue enhancements. The Companys research and development strategy is to allocate most of its available resources among the Companys core market areas based on the potential market size, estimated development time and cost, and the expected efficacy for any potential product or service offering. To the extent the Company identifies new non-core products or additional applications for its core products, the Company may attempt to license these products to corporate partners for further development or seek funding from outside sources to continue commercial development. The Company may also attempt to acquire or license additional strategically complementary products or technologies from third parties to supplement its product lines. 
 
17 
 
Research on these and other projects is conducted in the Companys research and development laboratory or at universities or clinics where the Company sponsors research projects, under the supervision of the Companys medical and scientific advisory board. The Company also conducts preclinical and clinical studies at universities, medical centers, hospitals, and other third-party locations under contract with the Company. Research is inherently risky, and any potential products or tissues under development ultimately may not be deemed safe or effective or worth commercializing for other reasons and, therefore, may not generate a return on investment for the Company. The Companys clinical research department also collects and maintains clinical data on the use and effectiveness of its products and services. The Company uses this data to inform third parties on the benefits of the Companys products and services and to help direct its continuing improvement efforts. 
 In 2016, 2015, and 2014 the Company spent approximately $13.4 million, $10.4 million, and $8.7 million, respectively, on research and development activities on new and existing products. These amounts represented approximately 7%, 7%, and 6% of the Companys revenues for each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 CryoLife is in the process of developing or investigating several new products and technologies, as well as changes and enhancements to its existing products and services. The Companys strategies for driving growth include new product approvals, new product indications, global expansion, and business development. These activities will likely require additional research, new clinical studies, and/or compilation of clinical data. 
 The Company is currently seeking regulatory approval for BioGlue in China. The Company is currently working with the Chinese regulatory authorities and its consulting partners to develop clinical protocols to pursue this approval. Study sites have been selected and enrollment is expected to begin in 2017. 
 The Company is currently conducting clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of additional sizes of On-X aortic and mitral heart valves. These studies are ongoing and enrollment is expected to continue throughout 2017. 
 The Company is currently conducting a clinical trial to assess reduced levels of required anticoagulation or warfarin for its On-X mitral heart valves. This study is ongoing and enrollment is expected to continue throughout 2017. 
 The Company is currently conducting a 50 plus patient, first in man, single arm clinical study to evaluate NeoPatchTM outcomes in a real world population of diabetic foot ulcers. NeoPatch is an allograft derived from human amniotic tissue that can be used, among other things, as a covering in advanced wound care to treat diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers. The 12-week follow-up on this initial series is expected to be completed in May 2017. 
 At the FDAs request, the Company is conducting a post-approval study to collect long-term clinical data for the On-X aortic heart valve with reduced warfarin therapy. This study is ongoing and data collection is expected to continue throughout 2017. 
 The Company is conducting its pivotal clinical trial to gain approval to commercialize PerClot for surgical indications in the U.S. The Company began enrollment in the trial in the second quarter of 2015 but later suspended enrollment pending consultation with the FDA regarding the trial protocol. These discussions resulted in two amendments to the trial protocol, the last of which was approved by the FDA in July 2016. The Company is in the process of conducting site start-up activities and resumed enrollment into the trial in the fourth quarter of 2016 with the goal of receiving PMA from the FDA in the first half of 2019. See also Part I, Item 1A, Risk FactorsRisks Relating To Our BusinessOur investment in PerClot is subject to significant risks, and our ability to fully realize our investment is dependent on our ability to obtain FDA approval and to successfully commercialize PerClot in the U.S. 
 Patents, Licenses, and Other Proprietary Rights 
 The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, confidentiality agreements, and security procedures to protect its proprietary products, preservation technology, trade secrets, and know-how. The Company believes that its patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and technology licensing rights provide it with important competitive advantages. The Company has also obtained additional rights through license and distribution agreements for additional products and technologies, including PerClot. The Company owns or has licensed rights to 38 U.S. patents and 11 foreign patents, including patents that relate to its technology for BioGlue and BioFoam, PHT, On-X heart valves, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy, PerClot, cardiac and vascular tissue preservation, and decellularization of tissue. The Company has 15 pending U.S. patent applications and 8 pending foreign applications that relate to the Companys products and services. There can be no assurance that any patent applications pending will ultimately be issued as patents. 
 
18 
 
The remaining duration of the Companys issued patents range from 2 months to 14 years. The main patent for BioGlue expired in mid-2012 in the U.S. and expired in mid-2013 in the majority of the rest of the world. Although the patent for BioGlue has expired, this technology is still protected by trade secrets and manufacturing know-how, as well as the time and expense to obtain regulatory approvals. 
 The Company has confidentiality agreements with its employees, several of its consultants, and third-party vendors to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the obligations of the Companys employees and third-parties, with whom the Company has entered into confidentiality agreements, will effectively prevent disclosure of the Companys confidential information, or provide meaningful protection for the Companys confidential information if there is unauthorized use or disclosure, or that the Companys trade secrets or proprietary information will not be independently developed by the Companys competitors. 
 See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to the Companys patents, licenses, and other proprietary rights. 
 Seasonality 
 See Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSeasonality, regarding seasonality of the Companys products and services. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016 CryoLife and its subsidiaries had approximately 665 employees. None of the Companys employees are represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and the Company has never experienced a work stoppage or interruption due to labor disputes. Management believes its relations with its employees are good. 
Environmental Matters 
 The Companys tissue preservation activities generate some biomedical wastes, consisting primarily of human and animal pathological and biological wastes, including human and animal tissue and body fluids removed during laboratory procedures. The biomedical wastes generated by the Company are placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes generated by the Company. The Company contracts with third parties for transport, treatment, and disposal of biomedical waste. Although the Company believes it is in compliance in the disposal of its waste with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the failure by the Company, or the companies with which it contracts, to comply fully with any such regulations could result in an imposition of penalties, fines, or sanctions, which could materially, adversely affect the Companys business. 
Risk Factors 
 CryoLifes business is subject to a number of risks. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors below for a discussion of these and other risk factors.
