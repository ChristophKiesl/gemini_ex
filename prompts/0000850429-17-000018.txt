Description of Business
Tredegar Corporation (“Tredegar”), a Virginia corporation incorporated in 1988, is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the manufacture of polyethylene (“PE”) plastic films, polyester (“PET”) films and aluminum extrusions. The financial information related to Tredegar’s PE films, polyester films and aluminum extrusions segments and related geographical areas included in Note 5 of the Notes to Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references herein to “Tredegar,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are to Tredegar Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
Prior to the third quarter of 2015, Tredegar reported two business segments: Film Products and Aluminum Extrusions. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company divided Film Products into two separate reportable segments: PE Films and Flexible Packaging Films. In separating PE Films and Flexible Packaging Films, the Company’s management believes that it is able to more effectively manage the distinct opportunities and challenges that each of these businesses face. The Company's current reportable business segments are PE Films, Flexible Packaging Films and Aluminum Extrusions. 
PE Films
PE Films manufactures plastic films, elastics and laminate materials primarily utilized in personal care materials, surface protection films and specialty and optical lighting applications. These products are manufactured at facilities in the United States (“U.S.”), The Netherlands, Hungary, China, Brazil and India. PE Films competes in all of its markets on the basis of product innovation, quality, price and service.
Personal Care. Tredegar’s Personal Care unit is one of the largest global suppliers of apertured, breathable, elastic and embossed films, laminate materials, and polyethylene and polypropylene overwrap films for personal care markets, including:

• | Apertured film and laminate materials for use as topsheet in feminine hygiene products, baby diapers and adult incontinence products (including materials sold under the ComfortAire™, ComfortFeel™ and FreshFeel™ brand names);


• | Breathable, embossed and elastic materials for use as components for baby diapers, adult incontinence products and feminine hygiene products (including elastic components sold under the ExtraFlex™, FabriFlex™, FlexAire™ and FlexFeel™ brand names);

In 2016, 2015 and 2014, personal care materials accounted for approximately 30%, 33% and 40% of Tredegar’s consolidated net sales (sales less freight) from continuing operations, respectively.
Surface Protection. Tredegar’s Surface Protection unit produces single- and multi-layer surface protection films sold under the UltraMask®, ForceField™ and ForceField PEARL™ brand names. These films are used in high-technology applications, most notably protecting high-value components of flat panel displays used in televisions, monitors, notebooks, smart phones, tablets, e-readers and digital signage, during the manufacturing and transportation process. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, surface protection films accounted for approximately 11%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of Tredegar’s consolidated net sales from continuing operations.
Bright View Technologies (formerly Engineered Polymer Solutions).

using Tredegar’s secured revolving credit agreement and will be treated as an asset purchase for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is expected to be immediately accretive to Tredegar’s consolidated ongoing earnings. 
Futura, headquartered in Clearfield, Utah, with a national sales presence and particular strength in the western U.S., designs and manufactures a wide range of extruded aluminum products for a number of industries and end markets, including branded flooring trims and TSLOTSTM, as well as OEM (original equipment manufacturer) components for truck grills, solar panels, fitness equipment and other applications. Futura has approximately 350 employees.
General
Intellectual Property. Tredegar considers patents, licenses and trademarks to be significant to PE Films. As of December 31, 2016, PE Films held 267 issued patents (63 of which are issued in the U.S.) and 116 trademarks (9 of which are issued in the U.S.). Flexible Packaging Films held 1 patent, which is issued in the U.S. and 13 trademarks (2 of which are issued in the U.S.). Aluminum Extrusions held no U.S. patents and 2 U.S. trademarks (1 of which is issued in the U.S.). These patents have remaining terms ranging from 1 to 20 years. Tredegar also has licenses under patents owned by third parties.
Research and Development. Tredegar’s spending for research and development (“R&D”) activities in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was primarily related to PE Films. PE Films has technical centers in Durham, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; and Terre Haute, Indiana. Flexible Packaging has a technical center in Bloomfield, New York. R&D spending by the Company was approximately $19.1 million, $16.2 million and $12.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Backlog. Backlogs are not material to the operations in PE Films or Flexible Packaging Films. Overall backlog for continuing operations in Aluminum Extrusions was approximately 13.5 million pounds at December 31, 2016 compared to approximately 11.8 million pounds at December 31, 2015, an increase of 1.6 million pounds, or approximately 14%. Volume for Aluminum Extrusions, which the Company believes is cyclical in nature, was 173.0 million pounds in 2016, 170.0 million pounds in 2015 and 153.8 million pounds in 2014.
Government Regulation. U.S. laws concerning the environment to which the Company’s domestic operations are or may be subject include, among others, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), all as amended, regulations promulgated under these acts, and any other federal, state or local laws or regulations governing environmental matters. Compliance with these laws is an important consideration because Tredegar uses hazardous materials in some of its operations, is a generator of hazardous waste, and wastewater from the Company’s operations is discharged to various types of wastewater management systems. Under CERCLA and other laws, Tredegar may be subject to financial exposure for costs associated with waste management and disposal, even if the Company fully complies with applicable environmental laws.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act relating to emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”), including mandatory reporting and permitting requirements. Several of the Company’s manufacturing operations result in emissions of carbon dioxide or GHG and are subject to the current GHG regulations. The Company’s compliance with these regulations has yet to require significant expenditures. The cost of compliance with any future GHG legislation or regulations is not presently determinable, but Tredegar does not anticipate compliance to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows based on information currently available.
Tredegar is also subject to the governmental regulations in the countries where it conducts business.
At December 31, 2016, the Company believes that it was in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits in the U.S. and other countries where it conducts business. Environmental standards tend to become more stringent over time. In order to maintain substantial compliance with such standards, the Company may be required to incur additional expenditures, the amounts and timing of which are not presently determinable but which could be significant, in constructing new facilities or in modifying existing facilities. Furthermore, failure to comply with current or future laws and regulations could subject Tredegar to substantial penalties, fines, costs and expenses.
Employees. Tredegar employed approximately 2,800 people at December 31, 2016.
