Each of Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Infrastructure Investments Fund. Following completion of the transaction, SJI intends to delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange.
At the effective time of the merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of SJI’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive $36.00 in cash, without interest.
SJI’s stockholders will be asked to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the merger at a special stockholders’ meeting that will be held on a date to be announced. The closing of the merger is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals by the BPU, and that the Merger Agreement be adopted by at least a majority of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote thereon at the meeting.
The Merger Agreement places limitations on SJI’s ability to engage in certain types of transactions without Parent’s consent between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, including limitations on SJI’s ability to issue dividends other than consistent with its past practices, acquire other businesses, issue equity of SJI (except in the ordinary course pursuant to equity compensation plans) and, subject to certain exceptions, incurring certain indebtedness for borrowed money.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights, including the right of SJI or Parent to terminate if the merger is not consummated within 12 months after signing, subject to certain extensions and exceptions. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $140.0 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances.  The Merger Agreement additionally provides that Parent pay the Company a termination fee of $255.0 million under certain specified circumstances.

Acquisitions: 
Catamaran and a third party formed Bronx Midco, of which Catamaran owns 99%. On June 9, 2021, Bronx Midco purchased a fuel cell project totaling 5 MW in Bronx, New York that is in the process of being constructed. Marina, through its ownership in Catamaran, has a 92% ownership interest in Bronx Midco. The total expected cost of the fuel cell project is $60.1 million, of which the partners have paid $28.7 million as of December 31, 2021. Of this total, Marina invested $26.4 million as of December 31, 2021.
In 2021, Catamaran completed its acquisition of a solar project in Massachusetts, of which Marina has a 90% ownership interest.

Resources
The Utilities:
Transportation and Storage Agreements
During 2021, SJG and ETG purchased and had delivered natural gas distribution of 46.6 MMdts and 32.5 MMdts, respectively. These deliveries were for on-system (SJG and ETG) and off-system (SJG) customers and for injections into storage (SJG and ETG). SJG's average cost per dt of natural gas purchased and delivered in 2021, 2020 and 2019, including demand charges, was $4.24, $3.52, and $4.17, respectively. ETG's average cost per dt of natural gas purchased and delivered in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $4.53, $3.85 and $4.33, respectively.
SJG has direct connections to the interstate pipeline systems of Transco and Columbia. SJG secures other long-term services from Dominion, a pipeline upstream of the Transco and Columbia systems. Services provided by Dominion are utilized to deliver gas into either the Transco or Columbia systems for ultimate delivery to SJG.
ETG has direct connections to the interstate pipeline systems of Transco, Columbia, Tetco and Tennessee. ETG secures other long-term services from several inter-state pipelines, Eastern Gas, National Fuel and Gulf South that are not directly connected to ETG and are upstream of the Transco and Tetco systems. Services provided by Eastern Gas are utilized to deliver gas into either the Transco or Tetco systems for ultimate delivery to ETG. Services provided by National Fuel and Gulf South are utilized to deliver gas into the Transco system for ultimate delivery to ETG. ETG also secures third-party storage services from Stagecoach Gas Services and Stagecoach Pipeline & Storage Company. 
Total transportation contracts as of December 31, 2021 for SJG and ETG are 385,512 dts/d and 287,523 dts/d, respectively. These contracts have terms with various ending dates, ranging from October 31, 2022 through Oct 31, 2041. 
Total storage capacity under contracts for SJG and ETG as of December 31, 2021 is 8.82 MMdts and 13.2 MMdts, respectively, with a total MDWQ of 163,289 dts and 225,343 dts, respectively. These contracts have terms with various ending dates, ranging from March 31, 2023 through September 30, 2029. 
South Jersey Industries, Inc.
Part I

The Company's intention is to renew or extend these transportation and storage service agreements before they expire.
Services provided by all of the above-mentioned pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.  
Gas Supplies
SJG has four separate AMAs with gas marketers that extend through March 31, 2022; SJG intends to extend these AMAs prior to their expiration. SJG released to the marketers its firm transportation rights, and in return the marketers manage this capacity and provide SJG with firm deliverability each day. The marketer's intents are to optimize the capacity released to SJG under these AMAs and pay SJG an asset management fee. Under the terms of these four AMA transactions, SJG has the right to purchase supply from the asset managers and SJG is entitled to a total fee of $7.8 million for the term of the agreements. 
SJG has committed to a purchase of a minimum of 15,000 dts/d and up to 70,000 dts/d, from a supplier for a term of ten years at index-based prices. 
ETG has an AMA with SJRG which extends through March 31, 2022; both entities plan to extend this AMA prior to its expiration. Under this agreement ETG released to SJRG and/or designated SJRG as agent for all firm transportation and storage contracts. SJRG is obligated to provide natural gas supply to meet demand requirements and optimize ETG’s portfolio of natural gas transportation and storage contracts. SJRG pays a fixed fee and shares net margin generated through portfolio optimization.
As part of the gas purchasing strategy, the Utilities use financial contracts to hedge against forward price risk. These contracts are recoverable through the BGSS clause, subject to BPU approval. 
Supplemental Gas Supplies
SJG operates peaking facilities, located in McKee City, NJ, where it liquefies, stores and vaporizes LNG for injection into its distribution system. SJG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 434,300 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 118,250 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system.
ETG operates a peaking facility, located in Elizabeth, NJ, where it stores and vaporizes LNG for injection into its distribution system. ETG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 165,000 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 25,000 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system.

Peak-Day Supply

SJG plans for a winter season peak-day demand on the basis of an average daily temperature of 2 degrees F or 63 Heating Degree Days, while ETG plans on an average daily temperature of 0 degrees F or 65 Heating Degree Days. Gas demand on such a design day for the 2021-2022 winter season is estimated to be 583,395 dts for SJG and 463,342 dts for ETG (excluding industrial customers). SJG and ETG project to have adequate supplies and interstate pipeline entitlements to meet design day requirements. SJG and ETG both experienced their highest peak-day demand for calendar year 2021 on January 29th.

Transportation and Storage Agreements
SJRG holds various firm transportation agreements with National Fuel, Transco, Dominion, Columbia, Tennessee and Tetco. Total transportation under contract is 423,030 dts/d. These contracts have terms with various ending dates, ranging from September 30, 2022 through March 31, 2043. 
South Jersey Industries, Inc.
Part I

SJRG holds multiple storage service agreements, primarily with Transco (for storage service at Transco's WSS facility) and National Fuel. Total storage capacity under contract is approximately 4.6 MMdts. The contracts have terms with various ending dates, ranging from October 31, 2022 through March 31, 2023.
The Company's intention is to renew or extend these transportation and storage service agreements before they expire.

Gas Supplies

SJRG has entered into several long-term natural gas supply agreements to purchase 526,400 dts/d, depending upon production levels, for terms ranging from five to eleven years at index-based prices. 
Patents and Franchises

The Utilities hold nonexclusive franchises granted by municipalities in the areas which they serve. No other natural gas public utility presently serves the territory covered by the Utilities' franchises. Otherwise, patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions are not material to the business of the Utilities.
Seasonal Aspects

Utility Companies

The Utilities experience seasonal fluctuations in sales when selling natural gas for heating purposes. The Utilities meet these seasonal fluctuations in demand from firm customers by buying and storing gas during the summer months, and by drawing from storage and purchasing supplemental supplies during the heating season. As a result of this seasonality, the Utilities' revenues and net income are significantly higher during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of the year.

Non-Utility Companies

Among SJI's non-utility activities, wholesale (including fuel supply management) has seasonal patterns similar to the Utilities. Activities such as energy services do not follow seasonal patterns. Other activities, such as retail electric marketing, can have seasonal earnings patterns that are different from the Utilities. The first and fourth quarters, however, remain the periods when most of SJI's revenue and net income is produced.
Climate Change
The potential impact of climate change on our operations is uncertain. Our operating results are significantly influenced by weather, and significant changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. Further, severe weather events, including but not limited to hurricanes, tropical storms, blizzards, winter storms, heat waves, heavy precipitation events, flooding, and wildfires, can result in delays or other negative consequences for our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. Climate change may also affect the conditions in which we operate or result in potential new regulations and regulatory actions, which could result in increased costs. 
The Company has taken several approaches to address climate change. The Utilities' earnings are largely protected from fluctuations in temperatures by their respective CIP clauses as described in Item 7. Management has identified multiple risks and opportunities related to climate change, including potential environmental regulation and technological innovation. Management is also responsible for assessing significant risks, developing and executing appropriate responses, and reporting to the Board of Directors on the status of risk activities. Accordingly, the Board provides oversight of the various challenges and opportunities presented by these risks, including the financial consequences that might result from enacted and potential federal and/or state regulation; plans to mitigate these risks; and the impacts these risks may have on the Company’s strategy. The Board of Directors is also informed of the Company’s practices and procedures to assess the impacts of operations on the environment.
