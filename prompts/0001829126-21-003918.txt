Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
New Beginnings Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (“Business Combination” or referred to throughout this amended Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Report”) as our initial business combination) on August 20, 2020.
 
The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had not yet commenced operations. All activity for the period from August 20, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020 relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering” or “IPO”), which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from net proceeds derived from Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.
 
The Company’s sponsor is New Beginnings Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”).
 
The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 29, 2020. On November 3, 2020, the Company consummated the IPO of 10,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of common stock included in the Units being offered, including the Over-Allotment Units, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 500,000 private units (the “Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit in a private placement to our Sponsor.
 
Transaction costs amounted to $6,731,655 consisting of $2,300,000 of underwriting discount, $4,025,000 of deferred underwriting discount, and $406,655 of other offering costs.
 
The Company granted the underwriters in the IPO a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments. On November 9, 2020, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option to purchase 1,000,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”), and on November 12, 2020, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option to purchase the remaining 500,000 Over-Allotment Units, generating an aggregate of gross proceeds of $15,000,000, and incurred $300,000 in deferred underwriting fees.
 
On November 9, 2020, simultaneously with the closing of the first exercise in part of the over-allotment option, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 30,000 Placement Units to our Sponsor, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of $300,000. On November 12, 2020, simultaneously with the closing of the second exercise in part of the over-allotment option, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 15,000 Placement Units to our Sponsor, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000.
 
Following the closing of the IPO on November 3, 2020, an amount of $101,000,000 ($10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Placement Units was placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”). Following the closing of the sale of the 45,000 Placement Units and 1,500,000 Over-Allotment Units, an additional $15,150,000 was placed in the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to $116,150,000. The funds in the Trust Account can only be invested in United States (“U.S.”) “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only on direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its tax obligations and up to $100,000 of interest for its dissolution expenses, the IPO proceeds held in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest to occur of (a) the completion of an initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and (c) the redemption of the Company’s Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months if the Company extends the period of time to consummate an initial business combination) from November 3, 2020 (the “Combination Period”), the closing of the IPO.

The Company’s initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable) at the time of the signing an agreement to enter into an initial business combination. However, the Company will only complete an initial business combination if the post-Initial business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect an initial business combination.
 
The Company will provide its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of the initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (initially approximately $10.10 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations).
 
The shares of common stock subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” In such case, the Company will proceed with an initial business combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of an initial business combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination.
 
The Company will have 12 months (or up to 18 months) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial business combination. However, if the Company is unable to complete an initial business combination within the Combination Period, the Company will redeem 100% of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to applicable law and as further described in the registration statement with respect to the IPO, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate.
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares (as defined below), any Placement Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of the initial business combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, any Placement Shares and Public Shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares and Placement Shares if the Company fails to complete the initial business combination within the Combination Period.
 
Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or initial business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.10 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.10 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of in the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities Act”). However, the Company has not asked its Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether its Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believes that its Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company believes it is unlikely that its Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations.

Pending Business Combination
 
On March 8, 2021, the company and Airspan Networks Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Airspan”), jointly issued a press release announcing the execution of a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) among the company, Airspan, and Artemis Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the company (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Airspan, with Airspan surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the company (the “Business Combination,” together with the other transactions related thereto, the “Pending Business Combination”).
 
Airspan is a US-based 5G end-to-end, Open RAN hardware and software provider with a product portfolio spanning 150 patents granted and 94 patents pending. The company is headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida and has global offices in London, Tel Aviv, Mumbai, and Tokyo.
 
Each share of capital stock of Airspan that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination (except as specified in the Business Combination Agreement) shall automatically be converted into and become the right to receive shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, as further described in, and subject to the terms of, the Business Combination Agreement. It is estimated that, at the consummation of the Business Combination, holders of outstanding shares of Airspan’s common stock as of immediately prior to such time will receive approximately 5.5 shares of our common stock as well as warrants to purchase additional shares of our common stock for each share of Airspan’s common stock held prior to the consummation of the Business Combination.
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement is subject to customary conditions, representations, warranties and covenants in the Business Combination Agreement, including, among others, approval by our stockholders, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 (the “Form S-4”) to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with the Pending Business Combination, and other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021.
 
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, we entered into certain common stock subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investment funds (the “PIPE Investors”) pursuant to which we have agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, in the aggregate, $75,000,000 of common stock (the “PIPE Investment”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per share. The closing of the PIPE Investment is conditioned on all conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement having been satisfied or waived and other customary closing conditions, and it is expected that the Pending Business Combination will be consummated immediately following the closing of the PIPE Investment.
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, we and the Key Company Stockholders (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) entered into that certain Stockholder Support Agreement (the “Stockholder Support Agreement”) in which such Key Company Stockholders agreed, among other things, subject to the terms and conditions of the Stockholder Support Agreement, to vote all of their shares of Airspan’s capital stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and approval of the Pending Business Combination and the other related transactions and (d) not directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information), whether publicly or otherwise, any inquiries, offers or proposals with respect to, or the making of, any Company Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Stockholder Support Agreement), (ii) engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to or furnish non-public information regarding, the Airspan’s or any of its properties, assets, personnel, books or records or any confidential information or data to, any person relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into, engage in or maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal (or inquiries, proposals or offers or other communications that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal) or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, offers, efforts, discussions or negotiations.
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor, Airspan and we entered into that certain Sponsor Support Agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”) in which the Sponsor agreed, among other things, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sponsor Support Agreement, (a) to forfeit 125,000 shares of our common stock held by the Sponsor immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), (b) to vote all shares of our common stock held by the Sponsor at such time in favor of the approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and approval of the Pending Business Combination, (c) to abstain from exercising any redemption rights with respect to any shares of our common stock held by Sponsor, (d) that it shall not directly or indirectly sell, assign, transfer, pledge, dispose of or otherwise encumber any of the shares of our common stock held by the Sponsor or otherwise agree to do any of the foregoing, except pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement and (e) that it shall not directly or indirectly take any action to solicit, initiate, continue or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or enter into any agreement with, or knowingly encourage, respond, provide information to or commence due diligence with respect to, any person (other than Airspan, its stockholders or any of their affiliates or representatives), concerning, relating to or which is intended or would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in, a Business Combination Proposal (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), other than with the Company, its stockholders and their respective affiliates and representatives.

You should not rely on the historical record of our management team’s or their respective affiliates’ performance as indicative of our future performance.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that can benefit from (i) the managerial and operational experience of our management team, (ii) additional capital and (iii) access to public securities markets. Our acquisition selection process will leverage our management team’s network of potential transaction sources, ranging from owners and directors of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, lenders, attorneys, accountants and other advisors across various sectors. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. We plan to utilize the network and industry experience of our management team in seeking an initial business combination and employing our initial business combination strategy. This network has been developed through our management team’s:

● | extensive experience in both investing in and operating in a variety of industries; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | managerial experience marketing and growing businesses; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | experience in sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | relationships with sellers, financing providers and target management teams; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | experience in executing transactions in a variety of industries under varying economic and financial market conditions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We expect these networks will provide our management team with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including private equity groups, investment banking firms, family offices, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Members of our management team communicate with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential initial business combination and are in the process of pursuing and reviewing potentially interesting leads.

Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek candidates with an enterprise value of between $400 million and $600 million, and we intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:

● | have a defensible market position, with demonstrated advantages when compared to their competitors and which create barriers to entry against new competitors; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are at an inflection point or are able to take advantage of public currency in order to drive improved financial performance; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have a diversified customer base better positioned to endure economic downturns and changes in the industry landscape; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have strong, experienced management teams, or a platform that will allow us to assemble an effective management team with a track record of driving growth and profitability; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide a scalable platform for add-on acquisitions, which we believe will be an opportunity for our management team to deliver incremental stockholder value post-acquisition; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | generate attractive returns on capital and have a compelling use for capital to achieve their growth strategy; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been overlooked by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | can benefit from being publicly-traded, are prepared to be a publicly-traded company, are capable of generating consistent returns in excess of cost of capital, and can effectively utilize access to the capital markets. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines,
 
Initial business combination
 
We will have up to 12 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by that date, we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our Sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate an initial business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to complete an initial business combination), subject to our Sponsor depositing additional funds into the Trust Account as set out below. Our shareholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in order for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be extended, our Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the Trust Account $1,150,000 on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three-month extension. Any such payments would be made in the form of a non-interest bearing loan and would be repaid, if at all, from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our Sponsor five days prior to the applicable deadline of its wish for us to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time period, we will redeem 100% of our issued and outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate.

As required by NYSE American rules, our initial business combination will be approved by a majority of our independent directors. The NYSE American rules also require that we must complete our initial business combination with one or more businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% fair market value test. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of the 80% fair market value test. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the “Investment Company Act”. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE American’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.

We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more industry knowledge than we do, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, because we are obligated to pay cash for the shares of common stock which our public stockholders redeem in connection with our initial business combination, target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. This may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.10 per share on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.

Employees
 
We currently have one officer, our Chief Executive Officer. This individual is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but he intends to devote as much of his time as he deems necessary, in the exercise of his business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time he will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.

Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our Units, common stock and Public Warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential initial business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential initial business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls.
