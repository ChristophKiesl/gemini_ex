ALJ is reported as corporate overhead. For results of operations by business segment, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Faneuil 
 Background 
 Faneuil is a Delaware corporation with headquarters in Hampton, VA. We acquired Faneuil from Harland Clarke Holdings Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc., for aggregate consideration of $53.0 million. 
 Faneuil is a nationally recognized leader in technology-enabled in-person and automated service delivery, particularly in regulated, highly complex environments. 
 Acquisition of Realtime Digital Innovations, LLC
 On July 31, 2019 (“RDI Purchase Date”), Faneuil acquired Realtime Digital Innovations, LLC (“RDI” and such acquisition, the “RDI Acquisition”), a provider of workflow automation and business intelligence services. The RDI Acquisition is expected to provide Faneuil with a sustainable competitive advantage in the business process outsourcing space by allowing it to, among others, (i) automate process workflows and business intelligence, (ii) generate labor efficiencies for existing programs, (iii) expand potential new client target entry points, (iv) improve overall customer experience, and (v) increase margin profiles through shorter sales cycles and software license sales. 
Services 
 Faneuil provides business processing solutions for an extensive client portfolio that includes both commercial and government entities across several verticals, including transportation, utilities, healthcare, consumer goods, and government/municipal services.  Utilizing advanced applications and a dedicated team of service professionals, Faneuil delivers broad outsourcing support, ranging from customer contact centers, fulfillment operations, and information technology services, to manual and electronic toll collection and violation processing, with the goal of building its clients’ brands by providing exemplary customer service.

Faneuil’s core competencies include: 
  
• | High-volume, multi-channel customer contact centers;

--+------------------------------------


• | Staffing services.
--+-------------------

 Faneuil employees who have contact with customers undergo intensive training and development, followed by structured monitoring and assessments before they are certified to process customer contacts. Faneuil’s customer contact employees provide service delivery through multiple communication channels, including telephone, fax, email, web chat and face-to-face interaction. Additionally, Faneuil provides multi-lingual representatives to accommodate the communication needs of non-English-speaking customers, as well as the hearing-impaired. 
 
Human Capital Management
 
Faneuil is committed to fostering a work environment that values diversity and inclusion. This commitment includes providing equal access to and participation in, equal employment opportunities, programs, and services without regard to race, religion, color, origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, age, or stereotypes based thereon. Faneuil welcomes team members' differences, experiences, and beliefs, and is investing in a more productive, engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce.
 Faneuil monitors human capital metrics and diversity. On September 30, 2021, Faneuil had 6,541 full-time employees (down from 7,743 employees on September 30, 2020). No Faneuil employees are represented by a labor union, or subject to any collective bargaining agreements. Faneuil considers its employee relations good.
 
Faneuil continues to focus on workplace safety by providing training and bringing awareness to workplace best practices in a continuous effort to reduce workplace injuries and accidents. Faneuil acted quickly to respond to safety protocols as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to protect the health and safety of team members. To support team members, Faneuil offered remote work options where possible, purchased additional sanitation supplies and increased personal protective materials provided to staff. 
 Customers 
 Faneuil’s client portfolio includes both government and commercial entities nationwide, including several toll authorities, state agencies, municipalities, publicly-owned utilities, health benefit exchanges, one government agency that operates the major airports serving the Washington, D.C. area, and several other public and private entities. 
 The percentages of Faneuil net revenue derived from its significant customers for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+---------------------------+-----
 | 2021 | | | 2020 | 
Customer A | | 10.1 | % | | | 10.6 | %
Customer B | | 10.0 | | | ** | 

 
** Less than 10% of Faneuil net revenue. 
 5

Many Faneuil customers are government agencies subject to contractual budgetary ceilings. State and local funding for these agencies is approved by the respective state legislature(s) each year. Depending on budgetary constraints, the contract values may be subject to change based upon ongoing legislative approval. 
 Competition
 Primary competitors to Faneuil are other large providers of toll services, such as Conduent, AEComm, and TransCore, Inc., as well as contact center operators such as Maximus and Automated Health Services. In many cases, Faneuil is smaller and has less financial and personnel resources than its competitors. If Faneuil cannot compete effectively to win new business and retain existing clients, its operating results will be negatively affected. To remain competitive, Faneuil must continuously implement new technologies and expand its portfolio of outsourced services and may have to make occasional strategic adjustments to its pricing for its services.
Properties 
 Faneuil leases all of its properties in various locations throughout the United States for customer contact centers, walk-in retail, and administration. Faneuil’s corporate headquarters are located in Hampton, VA. Faneuil’s leased facilities comprise an aggregate of approximately 487,000 square feet with leases that expire at various dates through June 2030. Faneuil believes that its existing leased facilities are adequate for current requirements. 
Backlog 
 Faneuil backlog represents executed contracts for future services. Most contracts are long-term and obligate Faneuil to provide services over multiple years. Faneuil backlog may not represent firm commitments as some contracts, especially with government entities, allow for cancellation under certain instances. Faneuil adjusts backlog to reflect contract cancellations, deferrals, and revisions known at the reporting date. However, Faneuil could experience additional contract modifications or cancellations, which may increase or decrease backlog. 
 
The following table reflects the amount of Faneuil backlog by the fiscal year we expect to recognize revenue:  
 
 
 | As of September 30, | 
-----------------------------------+---------------------+------
(in millions) | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Within one year | $ | 196.4 | | $ | 245.6
Between one year and two years | | 125.4 | | | 145.4
Between two years and three years | | 77.7 | | | 101.4
Between three years and four years | | 30.0 | | | 83.4 
Thereafter | | 21.3 | | | 38.1 
Total Faneuil backlog | $ | 450.8 | | $ | 613.9

 
The decrease in total Faneuil backlog from September 30, 2021 compared to September 30, 2020 was primarily the result of negotiating an early termination of a large unprofitable contract, and services provided in the normal course of business for long-term contracts outstanding on September 30, 2020.
 
For further information regarding Faneuil backlog, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business Generally and our Common Stock - We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.”
 Seasonality 
 Faneuil experiences seasonality within its various lines of business. For example, during the end of the calendar year through the end of the first calendar quarter, Faneuil generally experiences higher revenue attributable to its healthcare customers as the customer contact centers increase operations during the open enrollment periods of the healthcare exchanges. Faneuil revenue from its healthcare customers generally decreases during the remaining portion of the year after the open enrollment period. Seasonality is less pronounced with Faneuil customers in the transportation industry, though there is typically some volume increase during the summer months.

Governmental Regulation 
 Faneuil’s business is subject to many legal and regulatory requirements in the United States, covering such matters as data privacy, consumer protection, healthcare requirements, labor relations, taxation, internal and disclosure control obligations, governmental affairs and immigration. For example, Faneuil is subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding the protection of consumer information commonly referred to as “non-public personal information,” including the collection of patient data through Faneuil’s contact center services and medical device tracking services, which is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly known as HIPAA, which protects the privacy of patient data. These laws, regulations, and agreements require Faneuil to develop and implement policies to protect non-public personal information and to disclose these policies to consumers before a customer relationship is established and periodically thereafter. These laws, regulations, and agreements limit the ability to use or disclose non-public personal information for purposes other than the purposes originally intended. Many of these regulations, including those related to data privacy, frequently change and sometimes conflict with existing regulations amongst the various jurisdictions in which Faneuil provides services. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in liability for damages, fines, criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and restrictions on Faneuil’s operations.  Failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to Faneuil’s reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on Faneuil’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, because a substantial portion of Faneuil operating costs consists of labor costs, changes in governmental regulations relating to wages, healthcare and healthcare reform and other benefits or employment taxes could have a material adverse effect on Faneuil’s business, results of operations or financial condition. 
Management 
 Faneuil is led by ALJ board member Anna Van Buren, who has served as President and Chief Executive Officer since 2009 and previously served in executive roles at Faneuil since 2004. For additional information regarding Ms. Van Buren, see “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.” 
Phoenix Color Corp. 
 Background 
 Phoenix is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Hagerstown, Maryland. We acquired Phoenix from Visant Corporation for aggregate consideration of $88.3 million. 
 Phoenix is a premier full-service, full-color printer with over 40 years of superior printing experience. Drawing on a broad spectrum of materials and decorative technologies, Phoenix produces memorable, value-added components, heavily illustrated books, and specialty commercial products. Book publishers generally design book components to enhance the sales appeal of their books. The production of book components requires specialized equipment, materials, and finishes and often demands high-quality, intricate work. As a result, many leading publishers rely on specialty printers such as Phoenix to supply high-quality book components. This same philosophy applies to labels, packaging, and specialty commercial products, where Phoenix customers require the knowledge and expertise of a printer that can enhance their products for sale into the commercial marketplace. Phoenix has been servicing the publishing industry within the United States since 1979 and has formed lasting relationships with many of the biggest names in book publishing. 
 As a domestic manufacturer, Phoenix offers extensive, in-house digital pre-press capabilities and its technologically advanced UV printing platform supports an array of printing and finishing options. Phoenix innovative special effects include foil stamping, UV embellishments, and laminations, as well as its trademarked products LithoFoil®, MetalTone™, Look of Leather™, and VibraColor™. 
 Products and Services
 Books and Components 
 Phoenix offers several products for books and components, which represents more than 90% of Phoenix net revenue. 
 Phoenix is a leader in providing distinctive cover components and high-quality, heavily illustrated and multi-colored books for all markets. With its technologically advanced pre-press and press operations as well as an array of finishing applications and innovative special effects, Phoenix is committed to producing memorable, value-added products. 
 7

Labels and Packaging 
 In recent years, Phoenix has expanded into the label and packaging markets to leverage its unique printing and finishing capabilities as well as its trademarked special effects and extensive offerings of finishes and coatings. 
Human Capital Management
 Phoenix continually invests in and supports its employees and has an employee-focused, values-driven culture, which management believes is an advantage over its competitors.
 
Phoenix relies on highly qualified, skilled, and knowledgeable talent to support its strategic priorities. As such, Phoenix invests in (i) efforts to attract, develop, and retain employees, and (ii) tools, technologies, processes, and education to increase employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency.
 
Phoenix is committed to fostering a work environment that values diversity, equity, and inclusion to create an equal, safe, and fair work environment for all employees. On September 30, 2021, Phoenix had 417 full-time employees (up from 413 employees on September 30, 2020). No Phoenix employees are represented by a labor union, or subject to any collective bargaining agreements. Phoenix considers its employee relations good.
 Customers 
 Phoenix sells to many of the leading publishing companies. A small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of Phoenix net revenue. The percentages of Phoenix net revenue derived from its significant customers for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+---------------------------+-----
 | 2021 | | | 2020
Customer A | | 24.3 | % | | 24.4 | %
Customer B | | 22.6 | | | 18.9 | 
Customer C | | 12.2 | | | 13.0 | 

Suppliers
 Phoenix has historically purchased raw materials from a small number of suppliers primarily to control the quality of the product and to capitalize on volume discounts. If these suppliers were unable to provide materials on a timely basis, Phoenix management believes alternative suppliers could provide the required materials with minimal disruption to the business. Historically, Phoenix has not experienced any significant delay or shortage in the supply of materials. 
 The percentages of Phoenix inventory purchases from its significant suppliers for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: 
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+---------------------------+-----
 | 2021 | | | 2020 | 
Supplier A | | 19.6 | % | | | 14.1 | %
Supplier B | | 13.2 | | | 17.3 | 
Supplier C | ** | | | 10.6 | 

 
** Less than 10% of Phoenix inventory purchases.
 Backlog
 
Phoenix backlog represents executed master service agreements (“MSA”) that contain minimum volume commitments over multiple years for future product deliveries. Phoenix includes only the estimated minimum commitments in the MSAs as backlog. As Phoenix executed MSAs mostly provide for minimum volume commitments rather than minimum aggregate dollar spend, the actual revenue from such agreements may differ from our backlog estimates as to the total order volume and the timing of such volume. Phoenix adjusts backlog to reflect estimated order volumes delivered by its customers based on historical experience known at the reporting date; however, future variations in order volumes by Phoenix customers may increase or decrease backlog and future revenue.

The following table reflects the amount of Phoenix backlog by the fiscal year we expect to recognize revenue:
 
 
 | As of September 30, | 
-----------------------------------+---------------------+------
(in millions) | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Within one year | $ | 69.8 | | $ | 65.0 
Between one year and two years | | 64.7 | | | 63.5 
Between two years and three years | | 44.5 | | | 57.3 
Between three years and four years | | 43.3 | | | 43.3 
Thereafter | | 52.4 | | | 95.6 
Total Phoenix backlog | $ | 274.7 | | $ | 324.7

 
The decrease in Phoenix backlog on September 30, 2021 compared to September 30, 2020 was primarily driven by product delivery in the normal course of business for purchase orders outstanding on September 30, 2020.
 
For further information regarding the Phoenix backlog, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business Generally - We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.”
 Seasonality 
 There is seasonality to the Phoenix business. Education book component sales (school and college) traditionally peak in the first and second quarters of the calendar year. Other book components sales traditionally peak in the third quarter of the calendar year. Book sales also traditionally peak in the third quarter of the calendar year. The fourth quarter of the calendar year traditionally has been the weakest quarter. These seasonal factors are not significant. 
Competition 
 The printing industry in general and the printing and manufacturing of books, in particular, is extremely competitive. Over the past several years, there has been significant consolidation in the publishing industry, such that fewer publishers control a greater share of the market. Although there are still many small, independent publishers, they do not wield the leverage held by major publishing houses. Additionally, the printing industry has experienced a reduction in demand for trade books due to the impact of the e-book market and a reduction in textbooks due to lower state government funding, alternative product formats and digital distribution of content. 
 Primary competitors in the printing and manufacturing of books and book components include, but are not limited to Coral Graphics, Quad Graphics, and Worzalla. There is no reliable industry data available to determine Phoenix’s market share and position versus that of its competitors. With respect to book components, a portion of the products is produced by the book manufacturers and a portion by component printers. The dollar value of book components manufactured by the book manufacturers or by other component printers is unknown. Phoenix and Coral Graphics are the two primary trade book component manufacturers used by major publishers in the U.S. market. Most high-quality, heavily-illustrated and multi-colored books sold in the U.S. are produced outside of the U.S. Phoenix competes with Worzalla and several domestic book manufacturers for that portion that is produced domestically. 
 Environmental Matters
 
Phoenix is committed to creating quality products, while providing a safe and healthy workplace and acting as an environmentally responsible neighbor. Phoenix believes in preserving the environment and is committed to safeguarding natural resources and the environment as part of its daily operations.
 
Phoenix continues to seek solutions to reduce its environmental impact by identifying areas for improvement, continually seeking alternatives to improve efficiency of conventional energy usage and implementing new innovations to reduce its impacts on the environment.
 Properties 
 Phoenix owns its principal properties for corporate offices and production located in Hagerstown, MD, which totals approximately 276,000 square feet. Phoenix also owns two buildings totaling approximately 45,000 square feet in Terre Haute, IN. Additionally, Phoenix rents approximately 5,000 square feet in Rockaway, NJ under a month-to-month lease. Phoenix believes its facilities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months.

Management
 Phoenix is led by Marc Reisch, who currently serves as its Chairman and previously served as its Chief Executive Officer from 2008 to 2015. Mr. Reisch served as a director on ALJ’s Board of Directors from August 2015 until October 2019. For additional information regarding Mr. Reisch, see “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”
Carpets N’ More 
 Background 
 In January 2021, ALJ entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”), by and among the Company, Superior Interior Finishes, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Superior”) and Carpets, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell 100% of the membership interests of Carpets to Superior for an aggregate purchase price of $0.5 million (the “Purchase Price”) in cash (the “Transaction”). At the time of the PSA, Superior was 100% owned by Steve Chesin, the Chief Executive Officer of Carpets. The Company entered into the PSA because its Carpets business segment had been deemed a non-core holding and had underperformed over the past several years. The Transaction, which was approved by a committee of the Board comprised solely of certain independent directors of the Company, closed in February 2021. As such, the results of operations, assets, liabilities, and cash flows of Carpets were classified as discontinued operations in ALJ’s financial statements for all periods presented. See “Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules - Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures - Carpets Divestiture.”
 Additional Information About ALJ and its Subsidiaries 
 ALJ was originally incorporated in the State of Delaware under the name Nuparent, Inc. on June 22, 1999. The Company’s name was changed to YouthStream Media Networks, Inc. on June 24, 1999, and that name was used through October 23, 2006. The Company’s name was changed to ALJ Regional Holdings, Inc. on October 23, 2006. 
 As of September 30, 2021, ALJ corporate had five employees, consisting of its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and three support staff, performing services dedicated primarily to general corporate and administrative matters. No employee is represented by a labor union.
