Item 1. Business.
General
Systemax Inc., through its operating subsidiaries, is primarily a direct marketer of brand name and private label industrial and business equipment and supplies in North America going to market under the Global banner through a system of branded e-commerce websites and relationship marketers. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1995. Certain predecessor businesses which now constitute the Company's operations have been in business since 1949. Our headquarters office is located at 11 Harbor Park Drive, Port Washington, New York.
Current operations
The Company sells a wide array of industrial and general business hard goods and supplies and to a lesser extent products that would fall into the generally recognizable category of maintenance, repair and operations (“MRO”) products, which are marketed in North America. Many of these products are manufactured by other companies. Some products are manufactured for us and sold under our brand as a white label product, and some are manufactured to our own design and marketed under the trademarks: Global™, GlobalIndustrial.com™, Nexel™ Paramount™ and Interion™. 
See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information about our business as well as information about our geographic operations.

Accelerating the Customer Experience
The Company's multi-year business strategy is focused on Accelerating our Customers Experience (“ACE”). The ACE initiative, which guides our actions across the business, and specifically in our customer end-to-end purchase, service, and delivery experience, has at its core building of customer loyalty and trust by addressing unique customer needs through a responsive and tailored sales, product, and service experience. We build customer loyalty and trust through personalized and high touch customer interactions that often feature strong one to one relationships. The Company's digital and multi-channel sales model drives customer acquisition and with rigorous vetting we are able to identify opportunities for product category expansion, particularly private label products. Category expansion with our customers drives repeat orders and increases their annual and average spend. We maximize customer satisfaction and loyalty by coupling close customer relationships with product expertise, efficient and competitive fulfillment and delivery and exceptional customer service. 
WE CAN SUPPLY THAT™
Products
Our broad product offering and focus on responsiveness to our customers is captured in our promise “We Can Supply That”. We offer our customers a competitive assortment of leading products and services and a sales force with deep product knowledge and expertise. Our go to market strategy also focuses on leveraging our deep product knowledge and experience by seeking to expand our higher margin private label line of Global products by adding additional products and product categories. We have over one million brand name and private label products available through our e-commerce sites and have access to over 1.7 million products in our database. We endeavor to expand and keep current the breadth of our product offerings to fulfill the increasingly wide range of product needs of our customers, and periodically remove certain products from our offering to improve efficiencies or to address vendor or market changes. Sourcing hard to find or non-standard product helps to differentiate our business from our competitors and we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. 
Historically the Company has focused on products within the following categories: storage and shelving; material handling; janitorial and maintenance; furniture and office; and workbench and shop desks. We have become a destination and trusted supplier of these products by offering competitive pricing, high service levels, broad and deep product offering, extensive product and sales expertise. Importantly, we have a well-developed and expanding private label product portfolio offering both high quality and attractively priced alternatives to leading national brands. Other emerging or growing categories are becoming a larger portion of our product portfolio; these include HVAC/R and fans, safety and security, outdoor and grounds maintenance, tools and instruments, office and school supplies, plumbing and pumps, packaging and supplies, electrical and lighting, food service and appliances, raw materials and building supplies, motors and power transmission, pneumatics and hydraulics, medical and laboratory equipment, metalworking and cutting tools, vehicle maintenance, and fasteners and 
hardware. Within these categories we intend to use the go to market strategy that we successfully employed to grow our legacy core product categories, as discussed below.
Sales and Marketing
We market our products primarily to business customers, which include for-profit businesses, state, local, and private educational organizations and government entities including federal, state, and local municipalities. We have an established multi-faceted direct marketing system and customer life cycle marketing program which tends to begin with customer acquisition via keyword or branding search, supported by strategic account managers, leading e-commerce and account management tools, and deep pre and post sales product expertise which are intended to drive customer retention and penetration and to maximize sales. From time to time we adjust or re-allocate our marketing and advertising spend to best take advantage of changes in market conditions, changes in product mix and/or to drive special sales initiatives and product promotions and in 2020 we implemented various new strategies to further focus our online advertising spend to achieve improved results in both customer acquisition rates as well as customer retention.
Relationship Marketers
Our relationship marketers focus their efforts on our business customers by establishing a personal relationship between such customers and a Systemax account manager. The goal of the relationship marketing sales force is to increase the purchasing productivity of current customers and to actively solicit newly targeted prospects to become customers. With access to the records we maintain, our relationship marketers are prompted with product suggestions to expand customer order values. We also have the ability to provide such customers with electronic data interchange (“EDI”) ordering and customized billing services, customer savings reports and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by these customers. Our relationship marketers’ efforts are supported by e-mail campaigns and periodic catalog mailings, both of which are designed to generate inbound telephone sales, and visits to our interactive websites, which allow customers to purchase products directly online. We believe that the integration of our multiple marketing methods enables us to more thoroughly penetrate our business, educational and government customer base. We believe increased internet exposure leads to more internet-related sales and also generates more inbound telephone sales; just as we believe email campaigns, and to a lesser extent catalog mailings, which feature our websites results in greater internet-related sales.
E-commerce
We currently operate multiple e-commerce sites, including:


www.globalindustrial.com 
www.globalindustrial.ca 
www.industrialsupplies.com


We are continually upgrading the capabilities and performance of these websites in our significant markets. In 2019, we launched a new version of our globalindustrial.com website which provides advanced features and self-serve capabilities that increases ease of use, while supplying a premier customer experience. The new website allows customers to conduct more of their order and service-related tasks such as returns, auto reorder, replacement parts and order tracking online. In 2020 we enhanced our website for full ADA/508 compliance, expanded customer self service functions such as SMS notifications, added proactive notifications through Global Assist (order tracking on the web) and added the ability to create quotes and product reviews. In addition we have upgraded the look and functionality of our mobile site. 
Our internet sites feature over one million MRO and industrial and general business supplies. Our customers have around-the-clock, online access to purchase products and we have the ability to create targeted promotions for our customers’ interests. 
In addition to our own e-commerce websites, we have partnering agreements with several of the largest internet shopping and search engine providers who feature our products on their websites or provide “click-throughs” from their sites directly to ours. These arrangements allow us to expand our customer base at an economical cost.
