ITEM 1.                 BUSINESS.
Company Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of novel, safe, and effective agents for the prevention and treatment of severe and potentially life-threatening infectious diseases. Our lead product candidate, artemisone, is a clinical-stage synthetic artemisinin derivative with antiviral and antiparasitic properties. While artemisone is a clinical stage compound, as a result of prior development by third-parties, the Company’s development of artemisone for its proposed indications is in the pre-clinical phase. We expect to advance artemisone initially as an antiviral agent to address unmet clinical needs in the growing population of immunocompromised patients infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and other related clinical indications. While artemisone is a known chemical compound, that certain license agreement (the “License Agreement”) by and among the Company, Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. (“Hadasit”) and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology R and D Corporation Limited (“RDC”) provides us with the exclusive right to further develop it.
Business Strategy
 
Artemis’ mission is to improve the lives of patients through the creation of novel, safe, and effective anti-infective agents. To this end, Artemis plans to execute on the following strategy:
 
 • Rapidly and efficiently advance our lead experimental compound, artemisone, through clinical development for the prevention and treatment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in immunocompromised patients, as well as other clinical indications.
 
 • Execute strategic collaborations to maximize value and extend the potential of our lead candidate across multiple disease areas. We are focused on partnerships that could expand our geographic reach and allow us to expand into additional indications.
 
 • Develop a pipeline of anti-infective agents either through internal drug discovery efforts or by in-licensing external experimental or commercial agents and redeveloping them as anti-infectives in novel patient populations.
 
 

Artemis  has licensed pre-clinical data from Hadasit in HCMV and clinical data from RDC in the treatment of Malaria. We plan to develop and commercialize artemisone for HCMV and other viruses in the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation setting, with the possibility of exploring the use of artemisone with respect to congenital HCMV and solid organ transplants. At this stage, our expected research and development costs are not yet known and we will likely incur significant loses before generating revenues.  In addition, while we will need to hire employees to implement our development and commercialization efforts, the number of employees needed will vary at each stage of the development and will depend on market conditions and clinical trial results.
 
We plan on hiring internal employees and consultants with experience working in the anti-infectives therapeutic area in roles including corporate development, regulatory, clinical development and commercialization in the next six to twelve months.  We will coordinate our infrastructure growth based on the milestone timelines set forth in the License Agreement and as set forth below. We intend to outsource nearly all of our development, thereby minimizing the need to build our own infrastructure. This operational approach would result in our hiring as few employees as possible. Upon regulatory approval of artemisone, if achieved, we may seek to build our commercial infrastructure in the United States to assist in the sale of our product candidate, which would include hiring significantly more employees than we currently employ.
 
To date, through our interactions with the United States Food & Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and other regulatory agencies, a clear regulatory pathway to approval of artemisone in HCMV has yet to be established. It is thus not possible to determine accurate proposed development costs or an exact employee headcount necessary to obtain regulatory approval for this indication in the United States or any other global market.
 
Our development plans include the following milestones as set forth in the License Agreement: (i) a completion of CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control) development and manufacturing for Phase I in the fourth quarter of 2017; (ii) the completion of Phase I in the fourth  quarter of 2019; (iii) the completion of Phase IIa in the fourth quarter of 2022; and (iv) a regulatory submission in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
Description of Market
 
According to a study authored by Drs. Cannon, Schmid and Hyde titled “Review of cytomegalovirus seroprevalence and demographic characteristics associated with infection,” human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is believed to infect 50-100% of adults by age 50. Whereas HCMV infection in healthy individuals is mostly asymptomatic, HCMV can severely affect certain high-risk groups, including immunocompromised patients (for example, transplant recipients, patients with cancer, autoimmune disease, AIDS) and congenitally-infected infants, who acquire the infection in-utero through maternal exposure.  According to the publication titled “British Transplantation Society Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of CMV Disease after Solid Organ Transplantation, Third Edition,” HCMV infection occurs in approximately 60% of transplant patients as a result of immune suppression, and may lead to transplant rejection, serious illness, or death.  According to a study authored by Dr. Cannon titled “Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) epidemiology and awareness,” HCMV is also a major cause of birth defects, affecting > 5,500 infants annually in the U.S.
 
In addition to the foregoing, the hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) population is rapidly growing, as stem cell transplantation is increasingly utilized for treatment of multiple hematological and non-hematological diseases. According to a study conducted by Drs. Wolf, Shmueli, Or , Shapira, Resnick, Caplan, and Bdolah-Abram published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases (the “Wolf Study”), approximately 65% of HSCT patients are at risk for HCMV reactivation.  According to a study conducted by Drs. Boeckh and Nichols titled “The impact of cytomegalovirus serostatus of donor and recipient before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the era of antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy” (the “HSCT Study”), during the first year following allogeneic HSCT, the rate of non-relapse mortality is approximately 20%, with a significant proportion of these deaths attributable to HCMV.
 
 2
 

Treatment paradigms have evolved for addressing viral infection in HSCT and solid organ transplantation (SOT) patients, but toxicities associated with the currently available therapies have limited the significant evolution of treatment. Proof of concept for the prevention of HCMV in transplant patients (treatment beginning at or before transplant and continuing through the first 3-12 months) was established decades ago. Nonetheless, treatment-related toxicities have stalled the standard of care among HSCT recipients at “pre-emptive" therapy, where HCMV reactivation is closely monitored for in the blood, and treatment is initiated immediately after confirmation of active HCMV infection.  According to the Wolf Study and HSCT Study, although this treatment paradigm has greatly lessened fatalities associated with HCMV in transplant patients, there is still a high mortality rate and drug resistance rates are increasing.
 
According to a study contained in the British Transplantation Society Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of CMV Disease after Solid Organ Transplantation, there is a consensus that the standard of care must evolve to preventive treatment with the development of safer, more tolerable, and effective HCMV therapies.  However, at present, no therapies are approved for preventive treatment of HCMV disease. Hence, there is a great unmet need for an alternative therapy with an improved safety and tolerability profile appropriate for immunocompromised patients, and that in the future might be also extend to the setting of maternal/congenital infection.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Approximately 50,000 HSCTs and 100,000 SOTs are performed annually throughout the world, the majority of which occur at a relatively small number of treatment facilities in the United States and Europe.  This market opportunity within two closely-linked regulatory environments allows for a broad market reach with clearly defined clinical development parameters.

(numbers as of 2011 WHO census) | United States | European Union | Total 
--------------------------------+---------------+----------------+-------
HSCT | 20,000 | 26,000 | 46,000
SOT | 30,000 | 29,000 | 59,000



According to a study published by Drs. Manicklal, Emery, Lazzarotto, Boppana and Gupta titled “The ‘silent’ global burden of congenital cytomegalovirus”, the overall birth prevalence of congenital HCMV infection is ~ 0.7%, with even higher prevalence (1-5%) reported in developing countries. The study further showed that approximately 25% of congenitally infected newborns develop permanent hearing loss and a wide range of neurodevelopmental disabilities. Currently, there are no established prenatal or neonatal measures for prevention of congenital HCMV infection and disease. According to a study titled “Valganciclovir for Symptomatic Congenital Cytomegalovirus Disease” published in the New England Journal of Medicine, recently, postnatal treatment with intravenous ganciclovir for 6 weeks, or with oral valganciclovir (given for 6 months) has been shown to partially improve neurodevelopmental and auditory and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Yet, short-term toxicity and concerns over short- and long -term toxicity limit this treatment to children already symptomatic at birth. Once a high standard of safety profile is demonstrated for Artemis’ artemisinin derivatives, maternal/child health indication may be evaluated as a secondary market.
 
There is currently an increasing interest in investment in the field of HCMV prevention and treatment, as signaled by the investment of large pharmaceutical companies in HCMV vaccine and antivirals development. Like in the case of HIV and HCV, antiviral combination approaches hold promise for more efficient HCMV prevention and eradication.
 
Products/Technology
 
Artemis’ lead product candidate, artemisone, is an orally-administered 10-alkylamino artemisinin derivative. Artemisone was developed via combinatorial chemistry to produce an optimized compound. Artemisone was selected based on desired physico-chemical properties, ease and low cost of production, high solubility, stability, lack of toxicity, and higher antiparasitic and antiviral efficacy than parent artemisinin compounds. Preclinical laboratory research has demonstrated the antiviral potency of artemisone against HCMV. In vitro data demonstrated the higher efficacy of artemisone compared to 1st generation artemisinin derivatives, with evidence for a novel mechanism of action
  3
 

Pursuant to preclinical toxicity studies of artemisone conducted by Bayer AG, as well as some early clinical studies in malaria, have supported its further development as an anti-infective. With no preventive therapy approved for HCMV in HSCT recipients, Artemis is committed to moving artemisone forward initially in this clinical indication, while also continuing to invest in preclinical studies supporting other potential indications, including but not limited to other viral and parasitic infections.
 
Market Strategy
 
Subject to completing clinical development and receiving marketing approval, we intend to build a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States and potentially in Europe to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of physicians who are key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our products are being developed.
 
We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any product that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
 
Outside of the United States and potentially Europe, where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products. In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that target the prevention and treatment of viral infection. There are other companies working to develop therapies for the prevention and treatment of viral infection.
 
Three experimental compounds have reached late-stage clinical development. They include Letermovir from Merck, Maribavir from Viropharma, and Brincidofovir from Chimerix. Letermovir is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the prevention of HCMV infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Maribavir and Brincidofovir recently failed to meet their pre-specified endpoints in their respective Phase 3 clinical trials, leaving Letermovir as the only late stage competitor. We expect the competitive marketplace to remain open to new entrants due to different antiviral modes of action and to HCMV resistance patterns.
 
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any medicines that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, or other regulatory approval for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Intellectual Property
 
On May 31, 2016, Artemis entered into the License Agreement with Hadasit and RDC. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Artemis acquired an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license to make any and all use of certain patents and know-how owned by the Licensors relating to artemisone. The licensed know-how consists of data, processes, methods, and techniques relating to the licensed patents, including but not limited to preclinical and clinical study data and reports, manufacturing and analytical procedures, and regulatory materials and filings developed and prepared by Hadasit and/or Bayer Healthcare, owned by Hadasit, as it relates to artemisone.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, the potential royalty payments payable are in the low single digits.  Artemis has also agreed to certain milestone payments to the Licensors, which total an aggregate of up to approximately $12 million upon the occurrence of various milestones relating to regulatory approvals and sales of licensed products.
 
In addition, Artemis agreed to certain development milestones, including the completion of CMC development and manufacturing for Phase I by the fourth quarter of 2017, completion of Phase I by the fourth quarter of 2019, completion of Phase IIA by the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first regulatory submission by the fourth quarter of 2027. Additionally, Artemis agreed to certain investment milestones, including the requirement to obtain financing of not less than $700,000 within seven months of the closing of the Merger on August 23, 2016 (such time, the “Effective Time”), $1 million within 12 months of the Effective Time and $2 million within 24 months of the Effective Time. In the event that Artemis fails to meet the development milestone and investment milestones as set forth in the License Agreement, Hadasit has the right to terminate the License Agreement. Artemis is currently working towards achieving the development and investment milestone payments required in the License Agreement and its team of internal employees and external consultants are working diligently on a development plan and financing strategy.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Artemis agreed to first offer Dr. Wolf’s laboratory at Hadassah Medical Organization, over equivalent alternatives, the option to perform all pre-clinical, research and development activities within Dr. Wolf’s expertise and her laboratory’s capabilities, each such provision of services to be conducted under a separate agreement between Artemis and Hadasit, the terms of which to be mutually agreed between Artemis and Dr. Wolf (each a “Sponsored Research Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, the cost of such Sponsored Research Agreement shall total an aggregate of $200,000. The first Sponsored Research Agreement is to be entered into within 45 days of the Effective Time, whereby Artemis shall order services to be performed by Dr. Wolf during two 12 month consecutive periods.
 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Artemis was required to enter into a Consulting Agreement by and between Artemis, Dr. Wolf and Hadasit, effective as of the Effective Time (the “Consulting Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Consulting Agreement, Dr. Wolf will serve as the Chief Science Officer and a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Artemis and shall oversee research and development activities for Artemis. Hadasit shall permit to make Dr. Wolf available to perform services for Artemis for up to 15 hours per month, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The term of the Consulting Agreement is 3 years, subject to automatic renewal terms of 12 months, unless earlier terminated by the parties. Artemis may terminate the Consulting Agreement within 21 days of Hadasit filing a petition for bankruptcy or liquidation, immediately in the event Hadasit or Dr. Wolf breaches a material term of the Consulting Agreement and such breach is not cured, if curable, within 21 days of delivery to Hadasit of written notice of such breach. Hadasit may terminate the Consulting Agreement within 21 days of Artemis filing a petition for bankruptcy or liquidation, immediately in the event the Company breaches a material term of the Consulting Agreement, License Agreement or Sponsored Research Agreement and such breach is not cured, if curable, within 21 days of delivery to the Company of written notice of such breach. Dr. Wolf may terminate the Consulting Agreement upon 60 days prior notice. As consideration for the execution and performance of the Consulting Agreement, Artemis agreed to a monthly service fee to Dr. Wolf in the amount of $2,000 per month, plus value added tax, a fee of $300 per hour for any hour in excess of 15 hours worked by Dr. Wolf, $1,500 per day for trips made abroad by Dr. Wolf, as well as stock options in the amount of an aggregate of 300 shares to Hadasit (entitled to 50 of such option shares) and Dr. Wolf (entitled to 250 of such option shares), representing 3% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Artemis on a fully diluted basis, each subject to vesting. In that regard, Dr. Wolf was awarded an option to purchase 105,608 shares of the Company’s common stock, whereby 35,202 shares of common stock vests upon the date of grant and 35,203 shares of common stock vest upon each of the first and second anniversaries of the grant date, with the option becoming fully vested on August 22, 2018. The option issued to Dr. Wolf has an exercise price per share, on a common stock equivalent basis, of $0.01. In addition, Hadasit was awarded an option to purchase 21,122 shares of the Company’s common stock, whereby 7,040 shares of common stock vests upon the date of grant and 7,041 shares of common stock vest upon each of the first and second anniversaries of the grant date, with the option becoming fully vested on August 22, 2018. The option issued to Hadasit has an exercise price per share, on a common stock equivalent basis, of $0.01.

As part of the License Agreement, we have obtained a license relating to a family of patent applications derived from a single Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application filed on April 17, 2013. Specifically, US patent application No. 14/394,973, which is jointly assigned to Hadasit and RDC has been licensed to us. The claims of this patent application that were deemed allowable are directed to methods of treating a herpes viral infection or suppressing herpes viral replication (method of use claims). Additionally, a continuation US application serial No. 15/361150 was filed on November 25, 2016 with claims directed specifically to methods of treatment of HCMV. This patent will be due to expire on April 17, 2033. Importantly, there are pending counterpart patent applications in Europe and Japan.
 
Research & Development
 
In view of the urgent need for new and more effective antiviral drugs, Artemis’ vision is to combine innovative science and accelerated clinical development to create novel therapies against viral infections. To date, Artemis has not conducted any research towards artemisone’s development and has not spent any sums on research and development during the last two fiscal years. However, prior research and development of artemisone that was conducted by Hadasit and/or Bayer has been licensed for our use pursuant to the License Agreement.
 
Preclinical laboratory research conducted by Hadasit has demonstrated the antiviral potency of artemisone against HCMV. In vitro data demonstrated the higher efficacy of artemisone compared to 1st generation artemisinin derivatives, with evidence for a novel mechanism of action.
 
Preclinical toxicity studies, along with successful Phase 1 and malaria Phase 2 studies, each conducted by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, supported further development of artemisone. Such Phase 1 and malarias Phase 2 studies were conducted prior to our obtaining the License and were not done by us or on our behalf by another party. In addition, such studies were completed outside of the United States and therefore no investigational new drug application was filed. With no preventive therapy approved for HCMV in HSCT recipients, Artemis is committed to moving artemisone forward in this indication, continually investing in research and development once we have sufficient resources and staff to do so.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.

An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 
 • completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
 
 • submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”), which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
 
 • approval by an independent institutional review board, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
 
 • performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCP”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
 
•                 preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA, requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
 
 • review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
 
 • satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity;
 
 • satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
 
 • payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
 
 • compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent they choose to sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. For other countries outside of the European Union, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary.
 
In the European Union, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. On the other hand, a decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 1 employee and 1 consultant who provide services on a part-time basis. The employee and the consultant oversee day-to-day operations of the Company, including support management, engineering, manufacturing, and administration. We have no unionized employees.
 
We consider relations with our employee and our consultant to be satisfactory.
 
Corporate Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 22, 1997. On July 8, 2003, we effected a reincorporation from Nevada to Delaware through a merger with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, InkSure Technologies (Delaware) Inc., which was incorporated on June 30, 2003. The surviving corporation in the merger was InkSure Technologies (Delaware) Inc., which thereupon renamed itself InkSure Technologies Inc. In 2014, we changed our name to New York Global Innovations Inc.  Upon the closing of the Merger, defined below, Artemis Subsidiary, defined below, became our wholly-owned subsidiary. The Merger closed on August 23, 2016, and such date is referred to as the “Effective Time.”
 
On August 23, 2016, we consummated a merger with Artemis Therapeutics Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Artemis Subsidiary”) and Artemis Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger Subsidiary”), pursuant to which Artemis Subsidiary merged with and into the Merger Subsidiary, with Artemis Subsidiary being the surviving entity (the “Merger”).  Following the Merger, we adopted the business plan of Artemis Subsidiary. Artemis Subsidiary was incorporated on April 19, 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Between April 19, 2016 and August 23, 2016, Artemis’s business activities primarily consisted of negotiating and executing the License Agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Merger, the Merger Subsidiary merged with and into Artemis Subsidiary in a reverse merger, with Artemis Subsidiary surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. As consideration for the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 460,000 shares of common stock and 2,357.04 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock to the Artemis Subsidiary shareholders, such that each outstanding share of Artemis Subsidiary common stock was exchanged for the right to receive 50 shares of our common stock and 0.2562 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock (each share is convertible into 72,682.814 shares of the Company’s common stock) (collectively, the “Merger Shares”). In addition, we agreed to reserve for future issuance 40,000 shares of common stock and 204.96 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Artemis Subsidiary option holders, including options issued to Dr. Wolf and Hadasit, as set forth in greater detail herein. For an understanding of their terms and provisions, reference should be made to the Merger Agreement attached as an Exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
As a condition for the consummation of the Merger, the Company and Artemis Subsidiary agreed to the following covenants and closing conditions: (i) a requirement that a concurrent financing of not less than $590,000 shall have occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) a requirement that the Company have a cash balance of at least $590,000, exclusive of the concurrent financing at the Effective Time; (iii) a requirement that Artemis Subsidiary, Hadasit Medical Research Services & Development, Ltd. and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology R and D Corporation Limited have entered into and finalized a license agreement with respect to HCMV technology; (iv) the resignation of Roberto Alonso Jimenez Arias, our former director, as a director of the Company at the Effective Time; (v) the appointment by Artemis Subsidiary of a new director; (vi) the right for Gadi Peleg, or his designee, to continue serving as a director of the Company for a period of one year from the closing of the Merger; and (vii) for a period of one year from the closing of the Merger, in the event that the Company desires to enter into a transaction involving the sale of securities at a pre-transaction valuation of $10,000,000 or less, the approval of Mr. Peleg, or his designee, shall be required prior to the Company entering into such transaction. The Company and Artemis Subsidiary agreed to waive the requirement that a concurrent financing of not less than $590,000 shall have occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time and that the Company have a cash balance of at least $590,000, exclusive of the concurrent financing at the Effective Time.

In addition, on August 23, 2016, the Company closed on a private placement pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with Acumen Bioventures LLC (“Acumen”) with respect to the sale of an aggregate of $500,000 of 68,321 shares of the Company’s common stock and 453 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (each share is convertible into 1,453.656 shares of the Company’s common stock). The Securities Purchase Agreement provided that the Company will obtain shareholder approval within 90 days of the date thereof to increase its authorized capital or conduct a reverse stock split such that the Company will have reserved for issuance at least 200% of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of all of the Series A Preferred Stock or be subject to liquidated damages (the “Approval”). The Board of Directors and the stockholders holding a majority of the Company’s voting power approved a 1-for-50 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) on November 2, 2016 and November 9, 2016, respectively. The Company’s management and its largest shareholder provided the Company with their irrevocable consent to the Approval.  The Securities Purchase Agreement also provides the investor with a 24-month right to (i) participate in future financings, (ii) purchase up to 100% of its investment at 120% of the per share purchase price, (iii) be issued additional securities in connection with any subsequent dilutive issuance by the Company; and (iv) piggyback or demand registration rights.
 
In conjunction with the closing of the Merger, on August 23, 2016, Roberto Alonso Jimenez Arias resigned as a director of the Company. At the effective time of the Merger, the Company’s board of directors and officers were reconstituted by the appointment of Dana Wolf as our Chief Scientific Officer and Israel Alfassi as a director.
 
Following the issuance of the Merger Shares, but not inclusive of the securities issued to Acumen as part of the private placement, as of the Effective Time, there were an equivalent of approximately 5,476,679 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding (assuming the exercise of the Series B Preferred Stock) of which pre-existing stockholders hold 863,472 and former Artemis Subsidiary stockholders hold: (a) an equivalent of 3,426,326 shares of our common stock through their ownership of 2,357.04 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (assuming the exercise of the Series B Preferred Stock) and (b) 460,000 shares of our common stock directly.
 
As a result, and without taking into account the purchase of Series A Preferred Stock or common stock by Acumen, our pre-Merger Agreement stockholders hold approximately 17% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and the former stockholders of Artemis Subsidiary hold approximately 82% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, either directly or indirectly through their ownership of Series B Preferred Stock. After taking into account the purchase of Series A Preferred Stock and common stock by Acumen, our pre-Merger Agreement stockholders hold approximately 15% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, the former stockholders of Artemis Subsidiary hold approximately 73% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, either directly or indirectly through their ownership of Series B Preferred Stock, and Acumen holds approximately 12% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, either directly or indirectly through their ownership of Series A Preferred Stock.
 
For financial accounting purposes, the Merger between the Company and Artemis Subsidiary was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization and, as a result of the Merger, the Company ceased to be a shell company. As the shareholders of Artemis Subsidiary received the largest ownership interest in the Company, Artemis Subsidiary was determined to be the “accounting acquirer” in the reverse recapitalization.
