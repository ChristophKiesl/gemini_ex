ITEM 1.          BUSINESS 
Overview of Business
 
Blackboxstocks, Inc. is a financial technology and social media hybrid platform offering real-time proprietary analytics and news for stock and options traders of all levels. Our web-based software (the “Blackbox System”) employs “predictive technology” enhanced by artificial intelligence to find volatility and unusual market activity that may result in the rapid change in the price of a stock or option. We continuously scan the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), NASDAQ, Chicago Board Options Exchange (the “CBOE”), and other options markets, analyzing over 8,000 stocks and over 1,000,000 options contracts multiple times per second. We provide our users with a fully interactive social media platform that is integrated into our dashboard, enabling our users to exchange information and ideas quickly and efficiently through a common network. We recently introduced a live audio/video feature that allows our members to broadcast on their own channels to share trading strategies and market insight within the Blackbox community. We employ a subscription based Software as a Service (“SaaS”) business model and maintain a growing base of users that spans 42 countries.
 
The Blackbox System is a unique and disruptive financial technology platform combining proprietary analytics and broadcast enabled social media to connect traders of all types worldwide on an intuitive, user-friendly system. The complexity of our backend analytics is neatly hidden from the end user by our simple and easy to navigate dashboard which includes real-time alerts, scanners, financial news, institutional grade charting and proprietary analytics.
 
Development of the Blackbox System
 
The Blackbox System was made available for use to subscribing customers worldwide in September 2016. In December 2017, we launched our first Options Flow Scanner as a new feature on our platform. Our Options Flow Scanner is designed to monitor and alert our users to unusual activity on the options exchange. We have created many proprietary options alerts and a proprietary options “heatmap” to allow our users to follow large options purchases in real-time. This has proven to be a very popular feature for our users. We also added a Dark Pool Scanner in 2020. The Dark Pool Scanner feature monitors, tracks and displays large blocks of stock that are often purchased in dark pools and not on the regular exchanges. In October of 2020 we completed a system integration with the online brokerage platform TradeStation. This integration allows Blackbox users that have an account with TradeStation to trade directly through the Blackbox platform without leaving our dashboard.
 
We also provide our users with a full set of internal social media functions within our dashboard. These features include chat rooms, direct messaging, follow/block capability, custom user profiles, and most importantly broadcast enabled audio channels. We believe that combining these social media features with our analytics, within a single dashboard provides a unique user experience allowing for the rapid exchange of information and consensus throughout our community. The resulting dynamic is what we describe as “the best of man and machine”.
 
We are in the process of developing and anticipate adding many new features and functions to the Blackbox System, including but not limited to, native iOS and Android mobile applications, a crypto currency analytics and trading platform, as well as a comprehensive watchlist and portfolio management system. In January of 2021 we deployed an intermediate native application for iOS an Android phones to send push notifications to our users which allowed us to cease using a third-party solution that was inefficient and cumbersome. We are also in the process of upgrading our current chat and audio broadcast feature. Development of planned features and functions are expected to cost approximately $250,000.

Marketing of the Blackbox System
 
The Company launched its Blackbox System web application for domestic use and made it available to subscribers in September 2016. Use of the Blackbox System is sold on a monthly or annual subscription basis to individual consumers through our website at http://www.blackboxstocks.com. We believe our Blackbox System subscriptions are priced competitively with similar web-based trading tools. We primarily use a combination of digital marketing campaigns and customer referral compensation plans in our advertising program. Our digital advertising efforts utilize banner and similar marketing on social media platforms as well as targeted email. We believe that this form of advertising has been and will continue to be effective in attracting subscribers. We continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of specific social media platforms and allocate marketing funds accordingly. We also promote our subscriptions through an established compensated customer referral program. We offer certain subscribers the right to promote the Blackbox System and receive referral fees for subscribers generated from such subscribers’ effort. Generally, we pay referring subscribers $25 for each subscription generated and $25 for each month the subscriber continues their subscription. We incurred $272,908 and $121,227 in customer referral expenditures in each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to continue utilizing the customer referral sales program as it has proven to be an extremely efficient form of advertising. Our advertising and marketing expense was $705,706 and $261,470 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We intend to continue to deploy a significant amount of marketing funds on both digital campaigns and customer referral programs in the future. In addition, we may also utilize television and radio advertising.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product coding and marks. As of the date of this report, the Company has not yet registered any trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property associated with our business.
Government Regulation and Approvals
 
The Company offers its subscribing customers a trading tool and not a trading platform, broker dealer or exchange, and therefore does not expect to be subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, FINRA or other financial regulatory agencies. We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals required for the marketing or use of our Blackbox System or the services provided.Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment. The principal resources necessary for the development of investment software tools and services and knowledgeable personnel to conduct all phases of development and marketing operations are limited. We must compete for such resources with startups, major financial services companies and midsize competitors. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours.
 
We consider our platform unique and do not consider any trading tools or trading analytics software direct competitors of our Company. There are many trading tools on the current market often referred to as “scanners”, that provide features, functions and analytics similar to those of the Blackbox System. There are also many social media platforms that cater to stock traders that serve as real-time informational sources. However, we believe that our Blackbox System is the only platform that has successfully merged a comprehensive analytics system or “scanner” and a social media platform within the same “dashboard” allowing users to view the same real-time data in parallel. Our Blackbox System creates a unique community for traders that can all share the same information and analyze this information on an identical analytics in real-time. We also consider our system unique because our predictive algorithms automatically populate alerts for active stocks with high probability of short-term gains. In spite of these factors that differentiate us, we believe the following companies that could be considered competitors due to some like features and retail price point: Trade Ideas, Flow Algo, Trade Alert and Wall Street Jesus.
