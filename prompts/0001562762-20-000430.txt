Item 1. Business
General

Eaton Vance Corp. provides advanced investment strategies and wealth management solutions to forward-thinking investors around the world. Our principal business is managing investment funds and providing investment management and advisory services to high-net-worth individuals and institutions. Our core strategy is to develop and sustain management expertise across a range of investment disciplines and to offer leading investment strategies and services through multiple distribution channels. In executing our core strategy, we have developed broadly diversified investment management capabilities and a highly functional marketing, distribution and customer service organization. We measure our success as a Company based principally on investment performance delivered, client satisfaction, reputation in the marketplace, progress achieving strategic objectives, employee development and satisfaction, business and financial results, and shareholder value created.

We conduct our investment management and advisory business through wholly- and majority-owned investment affiliates, which include: Eaton Vance Management (EVM), Parametric Portfolio Associates LLC (Parametric), Atlanta Capital Management Company, LLC (Atlanta Capital) and Calvert Research and Management (Calvert). We also offer investment management advisory services through minority-owned affiliate Hexavest Inc. (Hexavest).

Through EVM, Atlanta Capital, Calvert and our other affiliates, we manage active equity, income, alternative and blended strategies across a range of investment styles and asset classes, including U.S., global and international equities, floating-rate bank loans, municipal bonds, global income, high-yield and investment grade bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. Through Parametric, we manage a range of systematic investment strategies, including systematic equity, systematic fixed income, systematic alternatives and

managed options strategies. Through Parametric, we also provide portfolio overlay services and manage custom separate account portfolios, including Custom Core™ equity, Custom Core fixed income, laddered fixed income, multi-asset and multi-manager portfolios. We also oversee the management of, and distribute, investment funds sub-advised by unaffiliated third-party managers, including global, emerging market and regional equity and asset allocation strategies. 

Our breadth of investment management capabilities supports a wide range of strategies and services offered to fund shareholders and separate account investors. Our equity strategies encompass a diversity of investment objectives, risk profiles, income levels and geographic representation. Our income investment strategies cover a broad duration, geographic representation and credit quality range and encompass both taxable and tax-free investments. We also offer alternative investment strategies that include global macro absolute return and commodity-based investments. Although we manage and distribute a wide range of investment strategies and services, we operate in one business segment, namely as an investment adviser to funds and separate accounts. As of October 31, 2020, we had $515.7 billion in consolidated assets under management.

We distribute our funds and individual separately managed accounts principally through financial intermediaries. We have broad market reach, with distribution partners including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, banks and insurance companies. We support these distribution partners with a team of approximately 160 sales professionals covering U.S. and international markets.

We employ approximately 30 sales professionals focused on serving institutional and high-net-worth clients who access investment management services on a direct basis and through investment consultants. Through our wholly- and majority-owned affiliates, we manage investments for a broad range of clients in the institutional and high-net-worth marketplace in the U.S. and internationally, including corporations, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, family offices and public and private employee retirement plans.

Company History 

We have been in the investment management business for over 90 years, tracing our history to two Boston-based investment managers: Eaton & Howard, formed in 1924, and Vance, Sanders & Company, organized in 1934. Eaton & Howard, Vance Sanders, Inc. (renamed Eaton Vance Management, Inc. in June 1984 and reorganized as Eaton Vance Management in October 1990) was formed upon the acquisition of Eaton & Howard, Incorporated by Vance, Sanders & Company, Inc. on April 30, 1979. Following the 1979 merger of these predecessor organizations to form Eaton Vance, our managed assets consisted primarily of mutual funds marketed to U.S. retail investors under the Eaton Vance brand and investment counsel services offered directly to high-net-worth and institutional investors. Over the ensuing years, we have expanded our investment offerings and distribution efforts to include closed-end, private and offshore funds, separately managed accounts offered through financial intermediaries, a broad array of investment strategies and services for institutional and high-net-worth investors, and multiple responsible investing options.

Our long-term growth strategy focuses on developing and growing market-leading investment franchises and expanding our distribution reach into new channels and geographic markets. Recent strategic acquisitions include the purchase of the business assets of WaterOak Advisors, LLC (WaterOak) in October 2020 and our purchase of substantially all of the business assets of Calvert Investment Management, Inc. (Calvert Investments) in fiscal 2017. 

In October 2020, we completed the purchase of the business assets of WaterOak, a wealth management firm headquartered in Winter Park, Florida, with $2.3 billion of client assets under management. WaterOak has been combined with Eaton Vance Investment Counsel to form Eaton Vance WaterOak Advisors (Eaton Vance WaterOak). Eaton Vance WaterOak provides high-net-worth families and institutions with access to sophisticated wealth management and investment solutions – including financial, estate and tax planning, investment management, and family office and trust services. Operating from Boston, New York and Florida, Eaton Vance WaterOak had $9.8 billion of client assets under management as of October 31, 2020. 

In December 2016, we completed the purchase of substantially all of the business assets of Calvert Investments. Founded in 1976, Calvert Investments became a pioneer in responsible investing in 1982 by launching the first mutual fund to avoid investing in companies doing business in apartheid-era South Africa. At acquisition, Calvert had $11.9 billion of assets under management. Of this, $2.1 billion had previously been included in the Company’s consolidated managed assets because Atlanta Capital is sub-adviser to one of the Calvert-sponsored mutual funds (Calvert Funds). The total managed assets of Calvert, including assets sub-advised by other Eaton Vance affiliates, have grown to $26.2 billion at October 31, 2020, reflecting cumulative net inflows of $9.6 billion and market price appreciation of $4.6 billion since acquisition.

EVMI markets the EV UCITS Funds and other sponsored strategies and services in Europe and certain other international markets. Eaton Vance Management International (Asia) Pte. Ltd.

We are headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Our affiliates also maintain offices in Atlanta, Georgia; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York, New York; Seattle, Washington; Washington, District of Columbia; Westport, Connecticut; West Palm Beach, Florida; Winter Park, Florida; London, England; Dublin, Ireland; Singapore; Sydney, Australia; and Tokyo, Japan. Our sales representatives operate throughout the United States and in the U.K., continental Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada and Latin America. We are represented in the Middle East through an agreement with a third-party distributor.

Current Developments

We are currently pursuing five primary strategic priorities: (1) capitalizing on our leadership position in specialty strategies and services for high-net-worth investors; (2) defending our floating-rate bank loan franchise and growing our short-duration fixed income franchises; (3) expanding our leadership position in responsible investing; (4) increasing our global investment capabilities and non-U.S. distribution; and (5) positioning the Company for success in a changing industry environment.

We report equity, fixed income and multi-asset separate accounts managed by Parametric for which customization is a primary feature as Parametric custom portfolios. This investment mandate reporting category includes Parametric Custom Core equity and fixed income strategies, Parametric laddered municipal and corporate bond separate account strategies, Parametric centralized portfolio management and Parametric multi-asset solution mandates. Parametric’s market-leading custom portfolio offerings combine the benefits of benchmark-based investing with the ability to customize portfolios to meet individual preferences and needs. In fiscal 2020, net inflows into Parametric custom portfolios totaled $5.7 billion, generating internal growth in managed assets of 3 percent. We continue to expand Parametric’s solution set and invest in technology to enhance client service and realize operating efficiencies and scale economies, further strengthening Parametric’s leadership position in the growing market for customized individual separate accounts.

Demand for floating-rate loan strategies contracted in fiscal 2020 as U.S. retail investors responded negatively to the sharp drop in benchmark short-term interest rates and rising credit concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Our floating-rate income category moved from net outflows of $8.3 billion in fiscal 2019 to net outflows of $5.0 billion in fiscal 2020. During the fiscal year, our market share among floating-rate loan mutual funds increased as the pace of industry net outflows exceeded our own. Net inflows into Eaton Vance and Calvert short-duration and limited-term fixed income mutual funds totaled $3.8 billion in fiscal 2020, led by Eaton Vance Short-Duration Government Income Fund. Driven by strong sales, Eaton Vance Short-Duration Government Income Fund has grown to net assets of $8.6 billion at October 31, 2020.

The Calvert Funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed equity, fixed and floating-rate income, and multi-asset strategies managed in accordance with the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment or other responsible investment criteria. Since Calvert became part of Eaton Vance in December 2016, we have experienced significant growth in Calvert-branded investment strategies and further distinguished Calvert as a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) research and responsible engagement. Including the Atlanta Capital-subadvised Calvert Equity Fund, assets under management in Calvert strategies grew to $26.2 billion at October 31, 2020 from $19.8 billion at October 31, 2019, reflecting net inflows of $4.5 billion and market price appreciation of $1.9 billion. Calvert’s $4.5 billion of net inflows in fiscal 2020 equates to internal growth in managed assets of 23 percent. 

While Calvert is the centerpiece of our responsible investment strategy, our commitment to responsible investing also encompasses our other investment affiliates. EVM and Atlanta Capital utilize Calvert’s proprietary ESG research as a component of their fundamental research processes, and portfolio customization to reflect individual client’s responsible investment criteria is a central feature of Parametric separate account offerings. As of October 31, 2020, Parametric managed $25.5 billion of client assets based on client-specified responsible investment criteria. On an overall basis, Eaton Vance is one of the largest participants in responsible investing, a position we are committed to growing in conjunction with rising demand for investment strategies that incorporate ESG-integrated investment research and/or seek to achieve both favorable investment returns and positive societal impact.

Our non-U.S. business had net inflows of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2020, led by EVM’s emerging market local income, global high yield and multi-asset credit strategies. Gaining greater distribution access to non-U.S. markets was a key strategic rationale for the proposed acquisition of Eaton Vance by Morgan Stanley announced on October 8, 2020.

The proposed acquisition of Eaton Vance by Morgan Stanley culminates a multi-year effort by our board and senior leadership to better position the Company for long-term success amid a changing environment for the asset management industry. The combination of Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley Investment Management brings together two growing, thriving asset management organizations with complementary strengths in investment management and distribution. As a key component of one of the world’s largest asset and wealth management organizations, we will gain access to Morgan Stanley’s resources to continue investing in our investment teams, distribution and client service capabilities, technology and operating platforms, and leading brands. Morgan Stanley’s distribution reach will provide greatly expanded market opportunities for us both in the U.S. and internationally. Morgan Stanley’s broad capabilities in private equity, private credit and private real estate investments and high-growth public equities will also create opportunities for our U.S. intermediary market sales teams to position these high-value strategies alongside our custom portfolios and other wealth management solutions to extend our leading position serving high-end financial advisors and their clients.

Individual Separate Accounts 
Individual separate accounts are separately managed accounts offered to individual investors through intermediary distribution platforms. According to a report from the Money Management Institute and Cerulli Associates, as of calendar year-end 2019 we were the largest manager of individual separate accounts in the U.S. Our individual separate account assets consist primarily of Parametric Custom Core equity and laddered municipal bond and corporate bond portfolios, which had assets under management of $92.5 billion and $35.4 billion, respectively, as of October 31, 2020. These market-leading offerings combine the benefits of benchmark-based investing with the ability to customize portfolios to meet individual preferences and needs. In fiscal 2020, Parametric introduced Custom Core fixed income to provide investors with a customized, index-based approach to fixed income investing similar to Custom Core equity separate accounts. 

In October 2020, we completed the purchase of the business assets of WaterOak, a wealth management firm headquartered in Winter Park, Florida, with $2.3 billion of client assets under management. WaterOak has been combined with Eaton Vance Investment Counsel to form Eaton Vance WaterOak. Through Eaton Vance WaterOak, we offer personalized wealth management services to high-net-worth individuals, families and institutions. Eaton Vance WaterOak investment counselors work directly with clients to establish long-term financial programs and implement strategies designed to achieve their objectives. The Company has been in the wealth management business since the founding of our predecessor Eaton and Howard in 1924.

Individual separate account assets under management totaled $170.6 billion at October 31, 2020.

Investment Management and Related Services

Our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries EVM and BMR are investment advisers to Eaton Vance and Parametric-branded funds, and Calvert is investment adviser to the Calvert funds. Although the specifics of our fund advisory agreements vary, the basic terms are similar. Pursuant to the advisory agreements, EVM, BMR or Calvert provides overall investment management services to each internally advised fund, subject, in the case of funds that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) (Registered Funds), to the supervision of each fund’s board of trustees or directors (together, trustees) in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives and policies. Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Hexavest and unaffiliated advisory firms act as sub-adviser to EVM, BMR or Calvert for certain funds. 

EVM provides administrative services, including personnel and facilities, necessary for the operation of all Eaton Vance and Parametric-branded funds, and Calvert provides such services for the Calvert funds, subject to the oversight of each fund’s board of trustees. For certain funds, administrative services are provided under comprehensive management agreements that also include investment advisory services; other funds have separate administrative services agreements. Administrative services include recordkeeping, preparing and filing documents required to comply with federal and state securities laws, routine legal, fund administration and compliance services, supervising the activities of the funds’ custodians and transfer agents, providing assistance in connection with the funds’ shareholder meetings and other administrative services, including providing office space and office facilities, equipment and personnel that may be necessary for administering the business affairs of the funds. Each agreement remains in effect indefinitely, subject to, in the case of Registered Funds, annual approval by each fund’s board of trustees. The funds generally bear all expenses associated with their operation and the issuance and redemption or repurchase of their securities, except for the compensation of trustees and officers of the fund who are employed by us. For certain sponsored funds, EVM, BMR or Calvert waives a portion of its management fee and/or has agreed to reimburse some expenses of the fund.

For Registered Funds, a majority of the independent trustees (i.e., those unaffiliated with the fund, its investment adviser and otherwise not an interested person under the 1940 Act) must approve the continuation of investment advisory and administrative agreements annually. The fund trustees generally may terminate these agreements upon 30 to 60 days’ notice without penalty. Shareholders of Registered Funds generally must approve amendments to the investment advisory agreements.

EVM, Calvert, EVTC and Eaton Vance WaterOak each has entered into an investment advisory agreement with the Gift Trust and/or related entities. The Gift Trust has a distribution agreement with EVD that compensates EVD for certain fundraising and servicing activities. EVTC also serves as trustee of the Gift Trust and related entities.

Either EVM, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Calvert, BMR or Eaton Vance WaterOak has entered into an investment advisory agreement for each separately managed account that sets forth the account’s investment objectives and fee schedule, and provides for management of assets in the account in accordance with the stated investment objectives. Our separate account portfolio managers may assist clients in formulating investment strategies. 

EVTC is trustee of each collective investment trust we sponsor. As trustee, EVTC is responsible for designing and implementing each trust’s investment program or overseeing sub-advisers engaged to manage the trust’s investment portfolio. EVTC also provides certain administrative and accounting services to each trust. For services provided under each trust’s declaration of trust, EVTC receives a monthly fee based on the average daily net assets of the trust.

Investment counselors and separate account portfolio managers employed by our subsidiaries make investment decisions for the separate accounts we manage, tailoring portfolios to the needs of particular clients. We generally receive investment advisory fees for separate accounts quarterly, based on the value of the assets managed on a particular date, such as the first or last calendar day of a quarter, or, in some cases, on the average assets for the period. These advisory contracts are generally terminable upon 30 to 60 days’ notice without penalty.

Marketing and Distribution

We market and distribute shares of Calvert, Eaton Vance and Parametric-branded funds domestically through EVD. EVD generally sells fund shares through a network of financial intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, banks, registered investment advisors, insurance companies and financial planning

14


firms. The Eaton Vance International (Ireland) Funds are UCITS funds domiciled in Ireland and sold by EVMI through certain intermediaries and directly to investors who are citizens of the U.K., member nations of the European Union (E.U.) and other countries outside the United States. The Eaton Vance International (Cayman Islands) Funds are Cayman Islands-domiciled funds sold by EVD and EVMI through intermediaries to non-U.S. investors.

Although the firms in our domestic intermediary distribution network have each entered into selling agreements with EVD, these agreements (which generally are terminable by either party) do not legally obligate the firms to sell any specific amount of our funds, investment strategies and services. EVD currently maintains a sales force of approximately 110 external and internal wholesalers who work closely with financial advisors in the intermediary distribution network to assist in placing Calvert, Eaton Vance and Parametric-branded funds.

Certain sponsored mutual funds have adopted distribution plans as permitted by the 1940 Act that provide for the fund to pay EVD distribution fees for the sale and distribution of shares and service fees for personal and/or shareholder account services (12b-1 fees). Each distribution plan with EVD for the Registered Funds is initially approved and its subsequent continuance must be approved annually by the board of trustees of the respective fund, including a majority of the independent trustees. 

EVD makes payments to financial intermediaries that provide marketing support, shareholder recordkeeping and transaction processing, and/or administrative services to the Calvert, Eaton Vance and Parametric-branded mutual funds. Payments are typically based on fund net assets, fund sales and/or number of accounts attributable to that financial intermediary. Registered Funds may pay all or a portion of shareholder recordkeeping and transaction processing and/or administrative services provided to their shareholders. Financial intermediaries also may receive payments from EVD in connection with educational or due diligence meetings that include information concerning funds and accounts we manage. 

EVD currently sells Calvert, Eaton Vance and Parametric-branded mutual funds under six primary pricing structures: front-end load commission (Class A); level-load commission (Class C); Calvert variable product pricing (Class F); institutional no-load (Class I, Class R6, and Institutional Class, referred to herein as Class I); intermediary no-load (Investor Class and Advisers Class, referred to herein as Class N); and retirement plan level-load (Class R). 

For Class A shares, the shareholder may be required to pay a sales charge to the selling broker-dealer of up to five percent and an underwriting commission to EVD of up to 75 basis points of the gross value of the shares sold. Under certain conditions, funds waive the sales load on Class A shares and the shares are sold at net asset value. EVD generally receives (and then pays to authorized firms after one year) a distribution and service fee of up to 30 basis points annually of average net assets of Class A shares outstanding. In recent years, most of our sales of Class A shares have been made on a load-waived basis through fee-based programs. EVD does not receive underwriting commissions on such sales. 

For Class C shares, the shareholder pays no front-end commissions but may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge on redemptions made within the first 12 months of purchase. EVD pays a commission and the projected first-year service fees to the selling broker-dealer at the time of sale. The fund makes monthly distribution plan and service fee payments to EVD at an annual rate of up to 75 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively, of average net assets of the Class. EVD retains the distribution and service fees paid to EVD for the first 12 months and pays the distribution and service fees to the selling broker-dealer after one year. 

15



Class F shares of Calvert variable products are offered at net asset value and are not subject to any sales charges. EVD receives, and then generally pays to selling broker-dealers, distribution fees of up to 25 basis points of average daily net assets annually. 

Class I shares are offered at net asset value and are not subject to any sales charges, underwriter commissions, distribution fees or service fees. For designated Class I shares, a minimum investment of $250,000 or higher is normally required. Designated Institutional Class shares are normally subject to a minimum investment of $50,000. Sales of R6 shares are limited to participating retirement plans and certain other investors.

Class N shares are offered at net asset value and are not subject to any sales charges or underwriter commissions. EVD receives (and then generally pays to selling broker-dealers after one year) combined distribution and service fees of 25 basis points of average net assets annually. 

Class R shares are offered to retirement accounts at net asset value with no front-end sales charge. The Company receives, and then generally pays to selling broker-dealers, distribution fees of 25 basis points and service fees of 25 basis points of average net assets annually. 

We also sponsor unregistered equity funds that are privately placed by EVD, as placement agent, and by various financial intermediaries to whom EVD and the subscribing shareholders may make sales commission payments. The privately placed equity funds are managed by EVM and BMR.

The marketing and distribution of investment strategies to institutional clients is subsidiary-specific. EVM has institutional sales, consultant relations and client service teams dedicated to supporting the U.S. marketing and sales of strategies managed by EVM, Calvert and Hexavest. Hexavest maintains its own marketing and distribution team to service institutional clients in Canada. Parametric and Atlanta Capital each maintain separate marketing and distribution teams to sell their respective investment strategies to U.S.-based institutions. EVMI is otherwise responsible for the institutional marketing and distribution of all EVM, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Calvert and Hexavest-advised strategies to institutions outside of North America. 

In June 2019, we announced a strategic initiative involving Parametric, EVM and EVD to further strengthen our leadership positions in rules-based, systematic investment strategies, customized individual separate accounts and wealth management solutions. As part of this initiative, we integrated under EVD the sales teams serving our clients and business partners in the registered investment advisor and multi-family office market. The combined team supports the sales and servicing of all of our investment strategies in this channel. 

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, we did not have any customers that provided over 10 percent of our total revenue. 

Regulation

EVM, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Calvert, BMR, Eaton Vance WaterOak and EVAIL are each registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements and disclosure obligations. Most Calvert, Eaton Vance and Parametric-branded funds are registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act imposes additional obligations on fund advisers, including governance, compliance, reporting and fiduciary obligations relating to the management of funds. Except for privately offered funds and exchange-listed funds exempt from registration, each U.S. fund is also required to make notice filings with most states

16


and U.S. territories where it is offered for sale. Virtually all aspects of our investment management business in the U.S. are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit shareholders of the funds and separate account clients, and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from carrying on our investment management business in the event we fail to comply with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on EVM, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Calvert, BMR, Eaton Vance WaterOak, EVMI and EVAIL engaging in the investment management business for specified periods of time, the revocation of any such company’s registration as an investment adviser and other censures or fines.

In June 2019, the SEC adopted rules and interpretations designed to enhance the protections of retail investors in their relationships with financial professionals, including broker-dealers and investment advisors. These rules included Regulation Best Interest and Form Client Relationship Summary (Form CRS). Regulation Best Interest, which took effect on June 30, 2020, imposes a “best interest” standard of conduct for broker-dealers and their representatives and enhances the “suitability” standard previously applicable to broker-dealers by imposing an explicit care obligation and additional disclosure and conflict of interest mitigation or elimination requirements on broker-dealers that make securities recommendations to retail investors. In addition to the SEC’s activity, several states have adopted or are considering rules that would establish heightened or more express standards of conduct for broker-dealers and investment advisors operating in such states. It is uncertain how these state initiatives will be affected by the implementation of Regulation Best Interest and possible pre-emption challenges. Form CRS requires broker-dealers and registered investment advisors to provide a brief relationship summary to retail investors, including (i) the types of client and customer relationships and services we offer, (ii) the fees, costs, conflicts of interest and required standard of conduct associated with those relationships and services, (iii) whether we or any of our financial professionals currently have reportable legal or disciplinary history, and (iv) how to obtain additional information.

Under a final rule and interpretive guidance issued by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in April 2012, certain non-bank financial companies have been designated for the Federal Reserve’s supervision as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Additional non-bank financial companies, which may include large asset management companies such as us, may be designated as SIFIs in the future. If the Company were designated a SIFI, it would be subject to enhanced prudential measures, which could include capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, annual stress testing by the Federal Reserve, credit exposure and concentration limits, supervisory and other requirements. These heightened regulatory obligations could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business and operations. 

EVM, Parametric and BMR are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) as Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors; other subsidiaries of the Company claim exemptions from registration. In 2013, the CFTC adopted rules for operators of registered mutual funds that are subject to registration as Commodity Pool Operators, generally allowing such funds to comply with SEC disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping rules as the means of complying with CFTC’s similar requirements. These CFTC rules do not, however, relieve registered Commodity Pool Operators from compliance with applicable anti-fraud provisions and certain performance reporting and recordkeeping requirements. We may incur ongoing costs associated with monitoring compliance with these requirements, including, but not limited to, CFTC and NFA registration and exemption obligations and the periodic reporting requirements of Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors.

17


Our mutual funds, privately offered funds and separate accounts that trade CFTC-regulated instruments are also regulated by the CFTC. In the event that EVM, Parametric or BMR fails to comply with applicable requirements, the CFTC may suspend or revoke its registration, prohibit it from trading or doing business with registered entities, impose civil penalties, require restitution and seek fines or imprisonment for criminal violations. In the event that clients on whose behalf we trade CFTC-regulated instruments fail to comply with requirements applicable to their trading, they would be subject to the foregoing remedies excluding suspension of license (provided they are not registered). In addition, to the extent any of the entities trade on a futures exchange or Swap Execution Facility, they would be subject to possible sanction for any violation of the facility’s rules. 

EVTC is registered as a non-depository Maine Trust Company and is subject to regulation by the State of Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions (Bureau of Financial Institutions). EVTC is subject to certain capital requirements, as determined by the Examination Division of the Bureau of Financial Institutions. At periodic intervals, regulators from the Bureau of Financial Institutions examine the Company’s and EVTC’s financial condition as part of their legally prescribed oversight function. There were no violations by EVTC of these capital requirements in fiscal 2020 or prior years. 

EVD is registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is subject to regulation by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the SEC and other federal and state agencies. EVD is subject to the SEC’s net capital rule designed to enforce minimum standards regarding the general financial condition and liquidity of broker-dealers. Under certain circumstances, this rule may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital and receive dividends from EVD. EVD’s regulatory net capital consistently exceeded minimum net capital requirements during fiscal 2020. The securities industry is one of the most highly regulated in the United States, and failure to comply with related laws and regulations can result in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the imposition of censures or fines, and the suspension or expulsion from the securities business of a firm, its officers or employees.

EVMI is regulated in the U.K. by the FCA as an authorized firm under a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license to conduct regulated business. EVMI’s primary business purpose is to distribute investment strategies and services in Europe and other non-U.S. markets. Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), EVMI is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements. Such requirements may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVMI. In addition, failure to comply with such requirements could jeopardize EVMI’s approval to conduct business in the U.K. There were no violations by EVMI of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2020 or prior years.

EVAIL is regulated by the FCA as a Full Scope Alternative Investment Fund Manager. EVAIL’s primary business is conducting discretionary investment management services. Under FSMA, EVAIL is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVAIL. Failure to comply with such requirements could jeopardize EVAIL’s approval to conduct business in the U.K. There were no violations by EVAIL of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2020 or prior years.

EVGA is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland as a UCITS Management Company with Individual Portfolio Management permissions. EVGA’s primary business purpose is to provide management services to EV UCITS Funds and U.S.-domiciled accounts via Memorandum of Understanding as a Participating Affiliate. EVGA is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVGA. There were no violations by EVGA of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2020 or prior years.

18


EVMIA is regulated in Singapore by the MAS. EVMIA’s primary business purpose is to conduct investment management activities and distribute investment strategies. Under MAS, EVMIA is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVMIA. There were no violations by EVMIA of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2020 or prior years. 

Our officers, directors and employees may from time to time own securities that are held by one or more of the funds and separate accounts we manage. Our internal policies with respect to individual investments by investment professionals and other employees with access to investment information require prior clearance of most types of transactions and reporting of all securities transactions, and restrict certain transactions to seek to avoid possible conflicts of interest. All employees are required to comply with all prospectus restrictions and limitations on purchases, sales or exchanges of shares of our mutual funds, and to pre-clear purchases and sales of shares of our closed-end funds.

Competition

The investment management business is a highly competitive global industry. We are subject to substantial competition in each of our principal investment classifications and distribution channels. There are few barriers to entry for new firms, and consolidation within the industry continues to alter the competitive landscape. According to the Investment Company Institute, there were approximately 830 fund sponsors at the end of calendar 2019 that competed in the U.S. mutual fund market. We compete with these firms, many of which have substantially greater resources, on the basis of investment performance, diversity of offered strategies, distribution capability, scope and quality of service, fees charged, reputation and the ability to develop new investment strategies and services to meet the changing needs of investors.

In recent years, investor demand for passive investment strategies, such as those employed by index mutual funds and index ETFs, has outpaced the demand for higher-fee actively managed investment strategies. Across many asset classes, actively managed strategies as a whole are experiencing net outflows. While our suite of customized, benchmark-based separate account offerings is positioned to benefit from market demand for passive investment strategies, a large majority of our management fee revenue is derived from active strategies. The continuing shift in market demand toward index funds and other passive strategies reduces opportunities for active managers and may accelerate fee compression.

In the intermediary channel, we compete with other mutual fund management, distribution and service companies that distribute through affiliated and unaffiliated sales forces, broker-dealers and direct sales to the public. According to the Investment Company Institute, at the end of calendar 2019 there were over 10,000 registered open-end funds whose shares were being offered to the public in the U.S. We rely primarily on unaffiliated financial intermediaries to distribute our funds, and pursue sales relationships with all types of intermediaries to broaden our distribution network. A failure to maintain strong relationships with intermediaries that distribute our funds could adversely affect our gross and net sales, assets under management, revenue and financial condition. 

We are also subject to substantial competition from other investment management firms in separate account channels. Financial intermediaries sponsoring managed account programs generally limit the number of approved managers within their programs, and firms compete based on investment performance and other considerations to win and maintain positions in these programs. For institutional separate accounts, we compete with other investment management firms based on the breadth of investment strategies and services offered, investment performance, strength of reputation, price and the scope and quality of client service.
