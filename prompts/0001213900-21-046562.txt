ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History 
   
Shentang International, Inc. (“we” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 29, 2007. We were an exploration stage company engaged in the exploration of mineral resource properties.
 
On July 22, 2009, the Company conducted a 1-to-10 stock split (the “Stock Split”) of the issued and outstanding common stock, so the Company’s issued and outstanding shares increased from 1,670,000 to 16,700,000 with par value of $0.001. Immediately after the Stock Split on July 22, 2009, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Boom Spring, Inc. (“Boom Spring”), and the shareholders of Boom Spring. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the shareholders of Boom Spring transferred to the Company all of the equity interest of Boom Spring in exchange for 12,000,000 outstanding shares of the Company and 33,300,000 newly issued shares of the Company (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Boom Spring became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company became a holding company with issued and outstanding common stock of 50,000,000 with par value of $0.001.
 
Pursuant to a board resolution dated October 21, 2009, the Company increased its authorized number of common stock from 50,000,000 to 190,000,000, and conducted a 2-for-5 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the issued and outstanding common stock. After the Reverse Stock Split, the Company’s issued and outstanding shares changed from 50,000,000 to 20,000,000 with par value of $0.001 effective on October 21, 2009. This reverse stock split also gave retroactive effect in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 and the computation of basic and diluted EPS is adjusted retroactively for all period presented accordingly.
 
The Company had exclusive use of the core technologies, including hollow/solid glass processing technology, pure manual glass rod processing technology, wire processing technology and painting processing technology. It developed “Yi Fan Feng Shun” liquor vessel with the brand of Wu Liang Ye. The Company was engaged in expanding in the international market. The Company also planned to build or acquire its own production capacity to meet the demand in the domestic Chinese market by purchasing or acquiring new equipment of machine-made glass producing. The objective of the Company was to become a large-scaled glass craftwork supplier and further develop its innovational technology.

On May 11, 2018, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC as custodian for Shentang International, Inc., proper notice having been given to the officers and directors of Shentang International, Inc. There was no opposition.
 
On May 18, 2018, the Company filed a certificate of revival with the state of Nevada, appointing David Lazar as, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director. On May 31, 2018, the Company obtained a promissory note in amount of $7,500 from its custodian, Custodian Ventures, LLC, the managing member being David Lazar. The note bears an interest of 3% and all unpaid interest and principal is due within 180 days following written demand. On May 31, 2018, the Company issued 27,000,000 shares of common stock to Custodian Ventures, LLC at par for shares valued at $27,000 in exchange for settlement of a portion of a related party loan for amounts advanced to the Company in the amount of $19,500, and the promissory note issued to the Company in the amount $7,500.
 
On July 2, 2018, the Company terminated its registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). On August 2, 2018, the Company filed a Form 10-12G, and on September 18, 2018, the Company filed the Amendment No. 1 to Form 10-12G which went effective on October 1, 2018.  On November 19, 2019, the Company board of directors determined that it was in their best interest to redeem the 27,000,000 shares of common stock, held by Custodian Ventures, LLC. In addition, the Company elected to cancel and return to the shareholder the promissory note dated May 31, 2018 in the amount of $7,500. The Company shall also pay the additional amount of $19,168.97 by issuance of a promissory note and cancel all interest due on the May 31, 2018 note.

The full purchase price set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement is $240,000, or $0.024, per share.

The Shares represent approximately 98% of the Company’s outstanding voting power as of the closing. Accordingly, as a result of the transaction, Purchaser became the controlling shareholder of the Company.

Business Objectives of the Company
 
Since the custodial proceedings, the Company had no business operations. Management has determined to direct its efforts and limited resources to pursue potential new business opportunities. The Company does not intend to limit itself to a particular industry and has not established any particular criteria upon which it shall consider a business opportunity.

The Company’s common stock is subject to quotation on the OTC Pink Sheets under the symbol “SHNL.” There is currently only a limited trading market in the Company’s shares nor do we believe that any active trading market has existed for approximately the last five years. There can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for our securities following the effective date of this registration statement under the Exchange Act. In the event that an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price of our shares of common stock, whether any trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained.
 
Management of the Company would have substantial flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective new business opportunity. The Company is dependent on the judgment of its Management in connection with this process. In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, we would consider, among other factors, the following:
 

● | costs associated with pursuing a new business opportunity; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | growth potential of the new business opportunity; 
● | experiences, skills and availability of additional personnel necessary to pursue a potential new business opportunity;
● | necessary capital requirements; 
● | the competitive position of the new business opportunity; 
● | stage of business development; 
● | the market acceptance of the potential products and services; 
● | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property; and 
● | the regulatory environment that may be applicable to any prospective business opportunity. 

 
The foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other criteria that Management may deem relevant. In connection with an evaluation of a prospective or potential business opportunity, Management may be expected to conduct a due diligence review.
 
The time and costs required to pursue new business opportunities, which includes negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable securities laws, cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty.
 
Management intends to devote such time as it deems necessary to carry out the Company’s affairs. The exact length of time required for the pursuit of any new potential business opportunities is uncertain. No assurance can be made that we will be successful in our efforts. We cannot project the amount of time that our Management will actually devote to the Company’s plan of operation. 
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations, either directly or through affiliates. Many if not virtually most of these competitors possess far greater financial, human and other resources compared to our resources. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses that we may identify, our ability to compete in acquiring certain of the more desirable target businesses will be limited by our limited financial and human resources. Our inherent competitive limitations are expected by Management to give others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business that we may identify and seek to pursue. Further, any of these limitations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our Management believes, however, that our status as a reporting public entity with potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over certain privately-held entities having a similar business objective in acquiring a desirable target business with growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from existing competitors of the business we acquire. In particular, certain industries which experience rapid growth frequently attract an increasingly larger number of competitors, including those with far greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources than the initial competitors in the industry in which we seek to operate. The degree of competition characterizing the industry of any prospective target business cannot presently be ascertained. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively, especially to the extent that the target business is in a high-growth industry.

Human Capital
 
Lei Xu, our Chief Executive Officer, president, secretary and treasurer, is our sole executive officer. Ms. Xu is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours per week and, in fact, intends to devote only as much time as she deems reasonably necessary to administer the Company’s affairs until such time as a business combination is consummated. The amount of time she will devote in any time period will vary based on the availability of suitable target businesses to investigate. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
