Liquidity
The Company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements. The Company expects to meet its liquidity needs through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, property dispositions, equity and debt issuances in the public or private markets and borrowings under commercial credit facilities.
Business Strategy
The Company owns and operates properties that facilitate the delivery of healthcare services in primarily outpatient settings. To execute its strategy, the Company engages in a broad spectrum of integrated services including leasing, management, acquisition, financing, development and redevelopment of such properties. The Company seeks to generate stable, growing income and lower the long-term risk profile of its portfolio of properties by focusing on facilities primarily located on or near the campuses of acute care hospitals associated with leading health systems. The Company seeks to reduce financial and operational risk by owning properties in high-growth markets with a broad tenant mix that includes over 30 physician specialties, as well as surgery, imaging, cancer, and diagnostic centers. 
2021 Investment Activity
In 2021, the Company acquired 44 medical office buildings, including acquisitions through the TIAA Joint Venture. The total purchase price of the acquisitions was $756.3 million and the weighted average capitalization rate for these investments was 5.3%. The following paragraphs provide further detail of the acquisition activity.
During 2021, the Company (exclusive of the TIAA Joint Venture) acquired 32 medical office buildings for purchase prices totaling $575.8 million. 
In 2020, the Company entered into the TIAA Joint Venture to invest in a broad range of medical office buildings. The Company has a 50% ownership in the TIAA Joint Venture and is the managing member. The TIAA Joint Venture is not consolidated for purposes of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2021, the TIAA Joint Venture acquired 12 medical office buildings for purchase prices totaling $180.5 million. 
The Company disposed of 17 properties during 2021 for sales prices totaling $188.4 million. The weighted average capitalization rate for these properties was 4.9%. The Company calculates the capitalization rate for dispositions as the in-place cash net operating income divided by the sales price.
In 2021, the Company funded $33.4 million toward development and redevelopment of properties. 
See the Company's discussion regarding the 2021 acquisition, joint venture and disposition activity in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and development activity in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, please refer to the Company's discussion in "Trends and Matters Impacting Operating Results" as part of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II of this report.
Competition
The Company competes for the acquisition and development of real estate properties with private investors, healthcare providers, other REITs, real estate partnerships and financial institutions, among others. The business of acquiring and developing new healthcare facilities is highly competitive and is subject to price, construction and operating costs, and other competitive pressures. Some of the Company's competitors may have lower costs of capital.
The financial performance of all of the Company’s properties is subject to competition from similar properties. The extent to which the Company’s properties are utilized depends upon several factors, including the number of physicians using or referring patients to an associated healthcare facility, healthcare employment, competitive systems of healthcare delivery, and the area’s population, size and composition. Private, federal and state health insurance programs and other laws and regulations may also have an effect on the utilization of the properties. The Company’s properties operate in a competitive environment, and patients and referral sources, including physicians, may change their preferences for a healthcare facility from time to time.
Government Regulation
The facilities owned by the Company are utilized by medical tenants which are required to comply with extensive regulation and legislation at the federal, state and local levels, including, but not limited to, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "Affordable Care Act"), the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, and laws intended to combat fraud, waste and abuse such as the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law and False Claims Act, and laws intended to protect the privacy and security of patient information, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. These laws and regulations establish, among other things, requirements for state licensure and criteria for medical tenants to participate in government-sponsored reimbursement programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company's leases generally require the tenant to comply with all applicable laws relating to the tenant's use and occupation of the leased premises. Although lease payments to the Company are not directly affected by these laws and regulations, changes in these programs or the loss by a tenant of its license or ability to participate in government-sponsored reimbursement programs could have a material adverse effect on the tenant's ability to make lease payments to the Company.
The negative financial impact from COVID-19 on healthcare providers since 2020 has been substantial, offset, in part, by government relief funding, which included provider payroll and rent subsidies, higher Medicare reimbursement rates, and Medicare payment advancement loans under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (“CARES Act”). Subsequent stimulus and COVID relief bills and, most recently, a federal stopgap spending bill to raise the federal debt ceiling, extended higher Medicare reimbursement rates for healthcare providers, expanded Medicaid eligibility, and increased subsidies for individuals to purchase health insurance on the state and federal health insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act. While the majority of the Company’s tenants returned to normal business operations during 2021, the ongoing impact from COVID-19 and the 
prospect of expirations of temporary federal relief funding could adversely affect tenants’ ability to make lease payments to the Company. 
Government healthcare programs have increased over time as a significant percentage of the U.S. population’s health insurance coverage. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent evaluation and change. Changes from year to year in reimbursement methodology, rates and other regulatory requirements may cause the profitability of providing care to Medicare and Medicaid patients to decline, which could adversely affect tenants' ability to make lease payments to the Company.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services continued to adjust Medicare payment rates in 2021 to implement site-neutral payment policies. These changes have lowered Medicare payments for services delivered in off-campus hospital outpatient departments in an effort to lessen reimbursement disparity in off-campus medical office and outpatient facilities. The Company’s medical office buildings that are located on hospital campuses could become more valuable as hospital tenants will keep their higher Medicare rates for on-campus outpatient services. However, the Company has not seen a measurable impact from site-neutral Medicare payment policy, positively or negatively. The Company cannot predict the amount of benefit from these measures or if other federal health policy will ultimately require cuts to reimbursement rates for services provided in other settings. The Company cannot predict the degree to which these changes, or changes to federal healthcare programs in general, may affect the economic performance of some or all of the Company's tenants, positively or negatively.
Since 2018, physicians have been required to report patient data on quality and performance measures that began to affect their Medicare payments in 2020. Implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), and the ongoing debate over the most effective payment system to use to promote value-based reimbursement, along with its budget-neutrality rule that requires any increases in payments to be offset by decreases, present the industry and its individual participants with uncertainty and financial risk. The Company cannot predict the degree to which any such changes may affect the economic performance of the Company's tenants or, indirectly, the Company.
Legislative Developments 
Taxation of Dividends
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 generally allows a deduction for individuals equal to 20% of certain income from pass-through entities, including ordinary dividends distributed by a REIT (excluding capital gain dividends and qualified dividend income). In addition, the deduction for ordinary REIT dividends is not subject to the wage and tax basis limitations applicable to the deduction for other qualifying pass-through income. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was a far-reaching and complex revision to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws and will require subsequent rulemaking and interpretation in a number of areas. As a result, the long-term impact of the Tax Reform Legislation cannot be reliably predicted. Further, many of the provisions of this act will expire in 2025, unless extended by legislative action.
Healthcare
Each year, legislative proposals for health policy are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, and regulatory changes are proposed and enacted by government agencies. These proposals, individually or in the aggregate, could significantly change the delivery of healthcare services, either nationally or at the state level, if implemented. Examples of significant legislation or regulatory action recently proposed, enacted, or in the process of implementation include:
•the CARES Act, along with subsequent stimulus and COVID-19 relief bills and federal spending legislation, which provided relief funding and financial aid to businesses, individuals, and healthcare providers impacted by COVID-19, including higher Medicare reimbursement rates, forgiveness of small business loans to providers for payroll and rent, and additional resources for testing and vaccine distribution; 
•the expansion of Medicaid benefits and health insurance exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act, whereby individuals and small businesses purchase health insurance with assistance from federal subsidies;
•various state legislature proposals for state-funded single-payer health insurance and a limit on allowable rates of reimbursement to healthcare providers;
•the implementation of quality control, cost containment, and value-based payment system reforms for Medicaid and Medicare, such as expansion of pay-for-performance criteria, bundled provider payments, accountable care organizations, comparative effectiveness research, and lower payments for hospital readmissions;
•ongoing evaluation of and transition toward value-based reimbursement models for Medicare payments to physicians as designated under MACRA;
•annual regulatory updates to Medicare policy for healthcare providers that can broadly change reimbursement methodology under budget-neutral guidelines, with the effect of lowering payments for some services and increasing payments for others, having a varying impact, positively or negatively, on providers; 
•ongoing efforts to equalize Medicare payment rates across different facility-type settings, according to Section 603 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which lowered Medicare payment rates, effective January 1, 2017, for services provided in off-campus, provider-based outpatient departments to the same level of rates for physician office settings; 
•the continued adoption by providers of federal standards for the meaningful-use of electronic health records;
•reforms to the physician self-referral laws, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, as adjusted in 2020 in order to promote the transition toward value-based, coordinated care among providers, although clear intent to boost referrals could still yield provider penalties;
•consideration of broad reforms to Medicare and Medicaid, including a significant expansion of Medicare coverage to the greater U.S. population;
•more stringent regulatory criteria by which federal antitrust agencies evaluate the potential for anti-competitive practices as a result of mergers and acquisitions of health systems and physicians;
•regulations requiring the publication of hospital prices for certain services, as well as hospitals’ negotiated rates with insurers for these services;
•limits on price increases in pharmaceutical drugs and the cost to Medicare beneficiaries, including the potential for setting prices according to an international standard; and
•the prohibition of “surprise billing,” or high payment rates charged to consumers for out-of-network physician services.
The Company cannot predict whether any proposals, rulings, or legislation will be fully implemented, adopted, repealed, or amended, or what effect, whether positive or negative, such developments might have on the Company's business.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property (such as the Company) may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, under, or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as certain other potential costs (including government fines and injuries to persons and adjacent property) relating to hazardous or toxic substances. Most, if not all, of these laws, ordinances and regulations contain stringent enforcement provisions including, but not limited to, the authority to impose substantial administrative, civil, and criminal fines and penalties upon violators. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances, and liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of a tenant or operator of the property. The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or lease such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. A property can also be negatively impacted either through physical contamination, or by virtue of an adverse effect on value, from contamination that has or may have emanated from other properties.
Operations of the properties owned, developed or managed by the Company are and will continue to be subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to the following: the generation, segregation, handling, packaging and disposal of medical wastes; air quality requirements related to operations of generators, incineration devices, or sterilization equipment; facility siting and construction; disposal of non-medical wastes and ash from incinerators; and underground storage tanks. Certain properties owned, developed or managed by the Company contain, and others may contain or at one time may have contained, underground storage tanks that are or were used to store waste oils, petroleum products or other hazardous substances. Such underground storage tanks can be the source of releases of hazardous or toxic materials. Operations of nuclear medicine departments at some properties also involve the use and handling, and subsequent disposal of, radioactive isotopes and similar materials, activities which are closely regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state regulatory agencies. In addition, several of the Company's properties were built during the period that asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other such facilities may be acquired by the Company in the future. The presence of such materials could result in significant costs in the event that any asbestos-containing materials requiring immediate removal and/or encapsulation are located in or on any facilities or in the event of any future renovation activities.
The Company has had environmental site assessments conducted on substantially all of the properties that it currently owns. These site assessments are limited in scope and provide only an evaluation of potential environmental conditions associated with the property, not compliance assessments of ongoing operations. While it is the Company’s policy to seek indemnification from tenants relating to environmental liabilities or conditions, even where leases do contain such provisions, there can be no assurance that the tenant will be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations. In addition, the terms of the Company’s leases do not give the Company control over the operational activities of its tenants or healthcare operators, nor will the Company monitor the tenants or healthcare operators with respect to environmental matters.
