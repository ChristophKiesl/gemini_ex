Item 1. Business.
Introduction



We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



Our executive offices are located at 260 Lena Drive, Aurora, Ohio 44202 and our telephone number is (212) 402-8216. Our corporate website address is www.pinetechnology.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this annual report. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities.



Company History



In December 2020, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,625,000 shares of Class B common stock (our “founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Our Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis, upon the completion of a business combination. The number of founder shares issued was based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (collectively, our “common stock’) upon completion of the initial public offering (the “IPO”).



On March 15, 2021, we completed our IPO of 34,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the “units”), generating gross proceeds of $345,000,000. Each unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “public shares”), and one-third of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.



Concurrently with the completion of the IPO, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,933,333 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per warrant, or approximately $8,900,000 in the aggregate. An aggregate of $345,000,000 from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement warrants was placed in a trust account (the “trust account”) such that the trust account held $345,000,000 at the time of closing of the IPO. Each whole private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.



On April 30, 2021, we announced that, commencing May 3, 2021, holders of the 34,500,000 units sold in the IPO may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock and the warrants included in the units. Those units not separated continued to trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “PTOCU” and the shares of Class A common stock and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “PTOC” and “PTOCW,” respectively.

Recent Developments



Terminated Business Combination Agreement




On December 7, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Pine Technology Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), and The Tomorrow Companies Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Tomorrow.io” and together with PTAC and Merger Sub, the “Parties”).



On March 6, 2022, the Parties entered into a Termination of Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Termination Agreement”) pursuant to which, due to market conditions, the parties agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement effective as of such date, after taking several factors into consideration. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, Tomorrow.io will pay us $1,500,000 upon the earliest to occur of (a) 120 days from the date of the Termination Agreement, (b) two business days after the initial closing of Tomorrow.io’s Next Financing (as defined in the Termination Agreement) and (c) immediately prior to the consummation of a Change of Control (as defined in the Termination Agreement).



As a result of the Termination Agreement, the Merger Agreement is of no further force and effect, and certain agreements entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Parent Support Agreement, dated as of December 7, 2021, by and among PTAC, Tomorrow.io and Sponsor, the Voting and Support Agreements, dated as of December 7, 2021, by and among PTAC, Merger Sub, Tomorrow.io and certain Tomorrow.io stockholders, and the Subscription Agreements, dated December 7, 2021, by and among PTAC with its sponsor and certain other investors, will either be terminated or no longer be effective, as applicable, in accordance with their respective terms.



We intend to continue to pursue the consummation of a business combination with an appropriate target.



The foregoing description of the Termination Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1, and the Termination Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.15, each of which is incorporated by reference herein.

Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC’s website (http://www.sec.gov) contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.



Facilities



PTAC maintains its principal executive offices at 260 Lena Drive, Aurora, Ohio 44202. PTAC pays the Sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services pursuant to the terms of an administrative services agreement between PTAC and an affiliate of the sponsor. Upon completion of its initial business combination or PTAC’s liquidation, PTAC will cease paying these monthly fees. PTAC considers its current office space adequate for its current operations.



Employees



PTAC currently has two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to PTAC’s affairs until PTAC has completed its initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. PTAC does not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of an initial business combination.



Emerging Growth Company



The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.



Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Company’s initial public offering, or December 31, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
