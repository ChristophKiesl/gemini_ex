Item 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company involved in the development of an injectable collagenase clostridium histolyticum (“CCH”) for multiple indications. We maintain intellectual property with respect to injectable CCH that treats, among other indications, Dupuytren’s contracture (“DC”), Peyronie’s disease (“PD”), frozen shoulder syndrome, and uterine fibroids. Injectable CCH currently is approved and marketed in the U.S. under the trademark XIAFLEX® for the treatment of both DC and PD. We generate revenue primarily from our license agreement with Endo, under which we receive license, sublicense income, royalties, milestones and mark-up on cost of goods sold payments related to the sale, regulatory submissions and approval of XIAFLEX®.
 
We have developed injectable CCH for 12 clinical indications to date. We currently are evaluating CCH as a treatment for uterine fibroids. Under our license agreement with Endo, Endo has the right to further develop CCH for frozen shoulder and plantar fibromatosis, as well as certain other licensed indications. Endo has a right to opt-in for use of CCH in the treatment of uterine fibroids.
 
Collagenase
 
Collagenase is the only protease that can hydrolyze the triple helical region of collagen under physiological conditions. The specific substrate collagen comprises approximately one-third of the total protein in mammalian organisms, and it is the main constituent of skin, tendon, and cartilage, as well as the organic component of teeth and bone. The body relies on endogenous collagenase production to remove dead tissue, and collagenase production is an essential biological mechanism, which regulates matrix remodeling and the normal turnover of tissue. The CCH developed by us has a broad specificity towards all types of collagen and, we believe is more efficient than mammalian collagenases.  CCH cleaves the collagen molecule at multiple sites along the triple helix whereas the mammalian collagenase is only able to cleave the molecule at a single site along the triple helix.
 
Collagenase is widely used for cell dispersion for tissue disassociation and cell culture because it does not damage the cell membrane. Since the main component of scar tissue is collagen, collagenase has been used in a variety of clinical investigations to remove scar tissue without surgery.
 
License Agreement with Endo
 
On August 31, 2011, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Development and License Agreement (as amended, the “License Agreement”) with Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Auxilium”), an entity that was acquired by Endo in 2015. The License Agreement originally was entered into in June 2004 to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to develop, market, and sell certain products containing our enzyme CCH, which Endo markets for approved indications under the trademark XIAFLEX®. Endo’s licensed rights concern the development and commercialization of products, other than dermal formulations labeled for topical administration. Currently, Endo’s licensed rights cover the indications of DC, PD, frozen shoulder, plantar fibromatosis, and other potential indications. We and Endo may further expand the License Agreement to cover other indications as they are developed.
 
On February 26, 2019, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Development and License Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) (effective as of January 1, 2019) to amend certain provisions of the License Agreement to, among other things, require Endo to provide timely estimates of royalties to assist us in complying with our financial reporting obligations. Pursuant to the terms of the Second Amendment, we have consented to the assignment of the License Agreement by Endo Global Ventures to Endo Global Aesthetics Limited, an Irish private company and an affiliate of Endo Global Ventures that is indirectly wholly-owned by Endo.

Under the License Agreement, Endo is responsible, at its own cost and expense, for developing the formulation and finished dosage form of products and arranging for the clinical supply of products. Endo has the option to license development and marketing rights to these indications based on a full analysis of the data from the clinical trials, which would transfer responsibility for the future development costs to Endo and trigger opt-in payments and potential future milestone and royalty payments to us.
 
The License Agreement extends, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, for the longer of the patent life, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity period or twelve years from the effective date. Either party may terminate the License Agreement as a result of the other party’s breach or bankruptcy.
 
Endo must pay us on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis a specified percentage, which typically is in the low double digits, of net sales for products covered by the License Agreement. This royalty applies to net sales by Endo or its sublicensees. Endo also is obligated to pay a percentage of any future regulatory or commercial milestone payments received from such sublicensees. In addition, Endo and its affiliates pay us an amount equal to a specified mark-up on certain cost of goods related to supply of XIAFLEX® (which mark-up is capped at a specified percentage of the cost of goods of XIAFLEX®) for products sold by Endo and its affiliates.
 
Pursuant to the License Agreement, Endo is selling XIAFLEX® in the U.S. for the treatment of DC and PD and is distributing XIAFLEX® in Canada through its operating company, Paladin Labs, Inc. In early 2020, Endo announced that it initiated XIAFLEX® development programs for the treatment of plantar fibromatosis and adhesive capsulitis. Endo had previously collaborated with partners to commercialize XIAFLEX® and Xiapex® outside of the United States and Canada. Endo is in the process of terminating third party partnership agreements for markets outside of the United States, which will reduce the amount of royalty revenues received by us. We do not believe that this reduction will have a material effect on our future consolidated statements of operations.
 
Operational Highlights
 
Endo-Marketed Indications
 
Dupuytren’s Contracture.
 
CCH is currently approved and marketed in the U.S. under the trademark XIAFLEX® for the treatment of DC. XIAFLEX® is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with DC with an abnormal buildup of collagen in the hands, which limits or disables hand function.
 
DC is a deforming condition of the hand in which one or more fingers contract toward the palm, often resulting in physical disability. The onset of DC is characterized by the formation of nodules in the palm that are composed primarily of collagen. As the disease progresses, the collagen nodules begin to form a cord causing the patient’s finger(s) to contract, making it impossible to open the hand fully. Patients often complain about the inability to wash their hands, wear gloves, or grasp some objects. DC is a genetic condition that is more common in men than in women, and increases in incidence with age.
 
XIAFLEX® is the only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of DC. Prior to FDA approval of XIAFLEX®, the only proven treatment for DC was surgery.
 
Peyronie’s Disease.
 
XIAFLEX® is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of PD.
 
PD is characterized by the presence of a collagen plaque on the shaft of the penis, which can distort an erection and make intercourse difficult or impossible in advanced cases. In some mild cases, the plaque can resolve spontaneously without medical intervention. In severe cases, the penis can be bent at a 90-degree angle during erection. Significant psychological distress has been noted in patients with PD who are sexually active. Frequent patient complaints include increased pain, painful erections, palpable plaque, penile deformity, and erectile dysfunction. Patients with PD have been reported to have an increased likelihood of having DC, frozen shoulder, plantar fibromatosis, knuckle pads, hypertension and diabetes. PD is a disease with an initial inflammatory component. This inflammatory phase is poorly understood with a somewhat variable disease course and spontaneous resolution occurring in certain cases. After approximately 12 months of disease, the disease is reported to often develop into a more chronic, stable phase. PD is believed to be underdiagnosed and undertreated.

In December 2013, the FDA approved the supplemental biologics license application (“sBLA”) submitted by Auxilium for XIAFLEX®. This is the first and only FDA-approved biologic therapy indicated for the treatment of PD in men with a palpable plaque and a curvature of 30 degrees or greater at the start of therapy.
 
Indications that Endo has Under Development
 
Cellulite (Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy).
 
Edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy, commonly known as cellulite, describes a condition in which lobules of subcutaneous adipose tissue extend into the dermal layer. Cellulite can involve the loss of elasticity or shrinking of collagen cords, called septae, that attach the skin to lower layers of muscle. When fat in cellulite prone areas swells and expands, the septae tether the skin, which causes surface dimpling characteristic of cellulite. These changes can visibly affect the shape of the epidermis and resemble an orange peel-like dimpling of the skin.
 
Cellulite has been reported to occur in 85-98% of post-pubertal females and rarely in men, and it is believed to be prevalent in women of all races. Current treatments for cellulite include massage devices, creams, unapproved injectables, laser-based procedures or liposuction. There are no drugs currently approved by the FDA to treat cellulite, and devices cleared by the FDA to treat the condition have varying degrees of success in eliminating cellulite. Cellfina and Cellulaze, the devices of two competitors in the cellulite market, have already received medical device approval. Treatment with XIAFLEX® is intended to target and lyse, or break, those collagen tethers with the goal of releasing the skin dimpling and potentially resulting in smoothing of the skin.
 
Endo’s license rights relating to CCH also permit Endo to develop product candidates containing CCH for certain medical aesthetics indications. For example, Endo has global marketing rights for CCH for the treatment of cellulite.
 
In September 2019, Endo submitted a BLA to the FDA for CCH for the treatment of cellulite in the buttocks. In November 2019, Endo announced the FDA’s acceptance for review of the original BLA for CCH for the treatment of cellulite in the buttocks. The BLA is supported by the results from RELEASE-1 and RELEASE-2 Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as a clinical program. Trial subjects receiving CCH showed highly statistically significant levels of improvement in the appearance of cellulite with treatment, as measured by the trials’ primary endpoint. In addition, the RELEASE-1 trial passed eight out of eight key secondary endpoints and the RELEASE-2 trial passed seven out of eight key secondary endpoints. Finally, CCH was well-tolerated in the actively-treated subjects with most adverse events being mild to moderate in severity and primarily limited to the local injection area.
 
According to Endo, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date for this application has been set for July 6, 2020.
 
Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis).
 
Frozen shoulder syndrome, of adhesive capsulitis, is a clinical syndrome of pain and decreased motion in the shoulder joint which results from inflammation and thickening of the shoulder capsule due to collagen. It is estimated to affect 20 to 50 million people worldwide with a slightly higher incidence in women. It is estimated that 300,000 cases of frozen shoulder syndrome are diagnosed annually in the U.S. It typically occurs in adults between the ages of 40-70. It is estimated that 20% of diabetics have frozen shoulder syndrome. No FDA-approved pharmaceutical therapies are currently available for the treatment of frozen shoulder. The most common treatments for frozen shoulder syndrome are longer-term extensive physical therapy, manipulation under anesthesia, corticosteroids and/or arthroscopy, and some drugs are used to manage pain.

On March 12, 2015, Endo provided an update on the results of the Phase 2b study without releasing all of the data. Endo noted strong drug effect and similar XIAFLEX® patient improvements in flexion, shoulder abduction and external and internal rotation seen across both Phase 2a and 2b trials and similar patient improvement in pain seen across both trials. Endo also noted an increased and unexpectedly robust placebo effect in those patients who did not receive XIAFLEX®. In early 2020, Endo announced that it initiated development programs of XIAFLEX® for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis.
 
Plantar Fibromatosis.
 
Plantar fibromatosis, or Ledderhose disease, is a medical condition characterized by pain and disability caused by the thickening of the feet’s deep connective tissue resulting in the formation of nodules or cords along the tendons of the foot. Patients with plantar fibromatosis often have DC and frozen shoulder. It is estimated that there are approximately 200,000 patients in the U.S. Treatment may include orthotics and anti-inflammatory drugs in the early stages of the disease, steroid injections and surgery in advanced cases. There are no pharmaceutical products that are FDA approved for use in this indication in the U.S. In November 2015, with our consent, Endo exercised an early opt-in for XIAFLEX® for this potential indication. Endo is responsible for further development of this indication. In early 2020, Endo announced that it initiated development programs of XIAFLEX® for the treatment of plantar fibromatosis. Other Indications
 
Uterine Fibroids.
 
Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that form on the wall of the uterus that contain large amounts of collagen and are associated with significant co-morbidities, which can include pain, decreased fertility, pregnancy complications, miscarriage, heavy menstrual bleeding and frequent urination. Uterine fibroids are the primary indication for hysterectomy in the U.S. Approximately 200,000 hysterectomies and 30,000 myomectomies are performed annually to treat fibroids. Uterine fibroids have been estimated to result in direct costs of $9.4 billion annually in the U.S., including costs for surgery, hospital admissions, outpatient visits and medications.
 
In October 2014, we published data showing that highly purified collagenase can reduce the rigidity of human uterine fibroid tissue and potentially shrink uterine fibroid tumors by interrupting the accumulation of poorly aligned and altered collagen. In May 2016, we announced that an article titled, “Loss of Stiffness in Collagen-Rich Uterine Fibroids after Digestion with Purified Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum” was published in the May 2016 issue of American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The ex-vivo study, led by Dr. Phyllis Leppert, showed reduction in stiffness and demonstrated the potential benefits of XIAFLEX® as a non-surgical treatment for uterine fibroid patients.
 
On April 18, 2017, we announced that we had initiated an open-label, dose escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of XIAFLEX® for the treatment of uterine fibroids.  The study, conducted at the Department of Gynecology & Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University, consisted of 15 female subjects treated prior to hysterectomy. The primary endpoint of the study assessed the safety and tolerability of a single injection of XIAFLEX® directly into the uterine fibroids under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The secondary endpoints assessed symptoms of pain and bleeding, quality of life throughout the study, shrinkage of XIAFLEX® treated fibroids in size, increased rates of apoptosis in treated fibroids and a decrease in the collagen content of the treated fibroids.
 
On October 31, 2018, we announced positive topline data from our Phase 1 trial of CCH for the treatment of uterine fibroids. The study met the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability of a single injection of XIAFLEX® directly into the uterine fibroids under transvaginal ultrasound guidance with no observed clinically significant adverse reactions.
 
We are currently analyzing the full Phase 1 data to guide the design of potential future studies of CCH for the treatment of uterine fibroids.

LICENSING AND MARKETING AGREEMENTS
 
License Agreement with Endo
 
On August 31, 2011, we entered into License Agreement, as summarized above.
 
On February 1, 2016, we entered into the First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the License Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company and Endo Global Ventures mutually agreed that in exchange for a $8.25 million lump sum payment, we will not receive future additional mark-up on cost of goods sold for sales by non-affiliated sublicensees of Endo outside of the U.S.; provided, however, that Endo will still be required to pay a mark-up on cost of goods sold for sales made in the “Endo Territory,” which includes sales made in the U.S. and sales made in any other country where Endo sells the product directly or through affiliated sublicensees. We received this $8.25 million lump sum payment in February 2016 and began recognizing this income over time based on sales by non-affiliated sublicensees of Endo outside of the U.S. according to our revenue recognition policy in the second quarter of 2016.
 
Additionally, we agreed that Endo may opt-in early to indications, prior to our submission of a clinical trial report, with our consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. For early opt-ins, Endo will be required to make an opt-in payment of $0.5 million on a per indication basis. For regular opt-ins, following our submission of a clinical trial report, Endo will be required to make an opt-in payment of $0.75 million on a per indication basis. Endo has opted-in to the following indications: frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis and human lipoma.
 
Pursuant to the License Agreement, we are entitled to receive certain up-front licensing and sublicensing fees, and milestone, mark-up on cost of goods sold and royalty payments. Through December 31, 2019, Endo has collectively paid us up-front licensing and sublicensing fees and milestone, mark-up on cost of goods sold and royalty payments under the License Agreement of $196.6 million, including fees relating to Endo’s sublicensee agreements with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (“Sobi”), Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation (“Asahi”) and Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Actelion”). Additionally, Endo is obligated to make contingent milestone payments to us, with respect to each of frozen shoulder, cellulite and canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis indications and human lipoma, upon the acceptance of the regulatory filing and upon receipt by Endo, its affiliate or sublicensee of regulatory approval. The remaining contingent milestone payments that may be received, in the aggregate, from Endo in respect of frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis and human lipoma are $6.0 million.
 
Endo partnered with Sobi, Asahi and Actelion to commercialize XIAFLEX® and Xiapex® outside of the United States. Sobi had exclusive rights to commercialize Xiapex® for DC and PD, subject to applicable regulatory approvals, in 28 EU member countries, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, 18 Central Eastern Europe/Commonwealth of Independent countries, including Russia and Turkey, and 22 Middle Eastern & North African countries. Sobi, via its Partner Products business unit, was primarily responsible for the applicable regulatory, and commercialization activities for Xiapex® in DC and PD in these countries. Endo granted to Asahi the exclusive right to develop and commercialize XIAFLEX® for the treatment of DC and PD in Japan. Actelion had marketing and commercial rights for XIAFLEX® in Australia and New Zealand. Endo is in the process of terminating third party partnership agreements for markets outside of the United States, which will reduce the amount of royalty revenues received by us. We do not believe that this reduction will have a material effect on our future consolidated statements of operations.
 
To the extent Endo enters into an agreement or agreements related to DC and PD in other territories, the percentage of sublicense income that Endo would pay us will depend on the territory, the stage of development and approval of XIAFLEX® for the particular indication at the time such other agreement or agreements are executed. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company no longer receives a mark-up on cost of goods sold for sales made by Endo outside of the U.S. to unaffiliated parties; provided, however, that if the sale is made outside of the U.S. by Endo directly, Endo is still required to pay us a mark-up on cost of goods sold.

Endo is required to pay on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis a low double digit royalty as a percentage of net sales for products covered by the License Agreement and sold in the United States, Europe, Canada, and certain Eurasian countries and Japan. In the case of products covered by the License Agreement and sold in other countries, or the Rest of the World (as defined in the License Agreement), Endo must pay us on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis a specified percentage of the royalties it is entitled to receive from a partner or partners with whom it has contracted for such countries. The royalty rate is independent of sales volume and clinical indication in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and certain Eurasian countries and Japan, but is subject to set-off in those other countries and the Rest of the World for certain expenses we owe to Endo relating to certain development and patent costs. In addition, the royalty percentage may be reduced if (i) market share of a competing product exceeds a specified threshold; or (ii) Endo is required to obtain a license from a third party in order to practice our patents without infringing such third party’s patent rights. To date, neither Auxilium nor Endo has paid any royalties to third parties. In addition, if Endo out-licenses to a third party, then we will receive a specified percentage of certain payments made to Endo in consideration of such out-licenses.
 
Endo’s royalty obligations extend for the longer of the patent life (including pending patents) or the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity period based on orphan drug designation or foreign equivalent thereof. Endo may terminate the License Agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice. If Endo terminates the License Agreement other than because of an uncured, material breach by us, all rights revert to us. Pursuant to our August 31, 2011 settlement agreement with Auxilium, we are now co-owners of U.S. Patent No. 7,811,560 and any continuations and divisionals thereof. We expect that this patent will expire in July 2028.
 
On top of the payments set forth above, as a result of the First Amendment, Endo must pay to us an amount equal to a specified mark-up of the cost of goods sold for products sold in the Endo Territory (as defined in the License Agreement), which will always include sales made in the United States and sales made in any other country where Endo Global Ventures sells the product directly or through affiliated sublicensees.
 
Endo is generally responsible, at its own cost and expense, for developing the formulation and finished dosage form of products and arranging for the clinical supply of products. Endo is generally responsible for all clinical development and regulatory costs for PD, DC, frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis, human lipoma and all additional indications for which it exercises its options.
 
In-Licensing and Royalty Agreements
 
We have entered into several in-licensing and royalty agreements with various investigators, universities and other entities throughout the years. Royalty obligations under these agreements are our responsibility. It is the policy of the Company not to announce publicly royalty rates for potential future indications under development before commercialization. It is important to emphasize that in-licensing royalty rates vary from indication to indication and it should not be assumed that the in-licensing royalty rates for potential future indications will be the same as those for currently marketed indications.
 
Dupuytren’s Disease
 
On November 21, 2006, we entered into a license agreement (the “Dupuytren’s License Agreement”), with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York at Stony Brook (the “Research Foundation”), pursuant to which the Research Foundation granted to us and our affiliates an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense to certain third parties, the know-how owned by the Research Foundation related to the development, manufacture, use or sale of (i) the collagenase enzyme obtained by a fermentation and purification process (the “Enzyme”), and (ii) all pharmaceutical products containing CCH or injectable collagenase, in each case to the extent it pertains to the treatment and prevention of Dupuytren’s disease.
 
In consideration of the license granted under the Dupuytren’s License Agreement, we agreed to pay to the Research Foundation certain royalties on net sales (if any) of pharmaceutical products containing CCH or injectable collagenase for the treatment and prevention of Dupuytren’s disease (each a “Dupuytren’s Licensed Product”).
 
 10
 
Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation with respect to sales by us, our affiliates or any sublicensee of any Dupuytren’s Licensed Product in any country (including the U.S.) arises only upon the first commercial sale of such Dupuytren’s Licensed Product on a country-by-country basis. The royalty rate is 0.5% of net sales. Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation will continue until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a patent pertaining to the Dupuytren’s Licensed Product; or (ii) the expiration of the regulatory exclusivity period conveyed by the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development (“OOPD”), with respect to the Dupuytren’s Licensed Product.
 
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its termination provisions, the Dupuytren’s License Agreement and the licenses granted under that agreement will continue in effect until the termination of our royalty obligations. After that, all licenses granted to us under the Dupuytren’s License Agreement will become fully paid, irrevocable exclusive licenses.
 
Peyronie’s Disease
 
On August 27, 2008, we entered into an agreement with Dr. Martin K. Gelbard (the “Gelbard Agreement”) to improve the deal terms related to our future royalty obligations for PD by buying down our future royalty obligations with a one-time cash payment. On March 31, 2012, we entered into an amendment to the Gelbard Agreement, which enables us to buy down a portion of our future royalty obligations in exchange for an initial cash payment and five additional cash payments. Under the Gelbard Agreement, royalty obligations terminated five years after the first commercial sale, which occurred in January 2014. Accordingly, we ceased paying royalties in February 2019.
Cellulite
 
On August 23, 2007, we entered into the license agreement (“Cellulite License Agreement”) with the Research Foundation, pursuant to which the Research Foundation granted to the Company and its affiliates an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense to certain third parties, the know-how owned by the Research Foundation related to the manufacture, preparation, formulation, use or development of (i) CCH and (ii) all pharmaceutical products containing CCH, which are made, used and sold for the prevention or treatment of cellulite. Additionally, the Research Foundation granted to us an exclusive license to the patent applications in respect of cellulite. The license granted under the Cellulite License Agreement is subject to the non-exclusive license (with right to sublicense) granted to the U.S. government by the Research Foundation in connection with the U.S. government’s funding of the initial research.
 
In consideration of the license granted under the Cellulite License Agreement, we agreed to pay to the Research Foundation certain royalties on net sales (if any) of pharmaceutical products containing CCH, which are made, used and sold for the prevention or treatment of cellulite (each a “Cellulite Licensed Product”). In addition, the Company and the Research Foundation will share in any milestone payments and sublicense income received by us in respect of the rights licensed under the Cellulite License Agreement. We paid a portion of the $0.5 million milestone payment we received from Auxilium in respect of its exercise of cellulite as an addition indication under the License Agreement, subject to certain credits for certain up-front payments we made to the Research Foundation.
 
Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation with respect to sales by us, our affiliates or any sublicensee of any Cellulite Licensed Product in any country (including the U.S.) arises only upon the first commercial sale of a Cellulite Licensed Product and is dependent upon there being a specified Research Foundation patent with valid claims covering the particular Cellulite Licensed Product.
 
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its termination provisions, the Cellulite License Agreement and licenses granted under that agreement will continue in effect until the termination of our royalty obligations. After that, all licenses granted to us under the Cellulite License Agreement will become fully paid, irrevocable exclusive licenses.
 
Frozen Shoulder
 
On November 21, 2006, we entered into a license agreement (the “Frozen Shoulder License Agreement”) with the Research Foundation, pursuant to which the Research Foundation granted to us and our affiliates an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense to certain third parties, the know-how owned by the Research Foundation related to the development, manufacture, use or sale of (i) CCH and (ii) all pharmaceutical products containing CCH or injectable collagenase, in each case to the extent it pertains to the treatment and prevention of frozen shoulder.
 
 11
 
Additionally, the Research Foundation granted to us an exclusive license to the patent applications in respect of frozen shoulder. The license granted to us under the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement is subject to the non-exclusive license (with right to sublicense) granted to the U.S. government by the Research Foundation in connection with the U.S. government’s funding of the initial research.
 
In consideration of the license granted under the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement, we agreed to pay to the Research Foundation certain royalties on net sales (if any) of pharmaceutical products containing CCH or injectable collagenase for the treatment and prevention of frozen shoulder (each a “Frozen Shoulder Licensed Product”). In addition, the Company and the Research Foundation will share in any milestone payments and sublicense income received by us in respect of the rights licensed under the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement.
 
Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation with respect to sales by us, our affiliates or any sublicensee of any Frozen Shoulder Licensed Product in any country (including the U.S.) arises only upon the first commercial sale of a Frozen Shoulder Licensed Product. Our obligation to pay royalties to the Research Foundation will continue until) the expiration of the last valid claim of a university patent pertaining to a Frozen Shoulder Licensed Product.
 
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its termination provisions, the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement and licenses granted under that agreement will continue in effect until the termination of our royalty obligations. After that, all licenses granted to us under the Frozen Shoulder License Agreement will become fully paid, irrevocable exclusive licenses.
 
Removal or Treatment of Fat
 
On March 27, 2010, we entered into the in-licensing and royalty agreement with Dr. Zachary Gerut (the “Gerut License Agreement”), pursuant to which, Dr. Gerut granted to us and our affiliates an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense to certain third parties the know-how owned by Dr. Gerut related to the manufacture, preparation, formulation, use or development of (i) CCH and (ii) all pharmaceutical products containing CCH or injectable collagenase, in each case to the extent it pertains to the removal or treatment of fat. As the in-license granted under the Gerut License Agreement pertains to the treatment of fat, this in-license also relates to both human lipoma and canine lipoma.
 
In consideration of the license granted under the Gerut License Agreement, we agreed to pay to Dr. Gerut certain royalties on net sales (if any) of pharmaceutical products containing CCH that are made, used and sold for the removal or treatment of fat in humans or animals (each a “Gerut Licensed Product”). In addition, in the event the FDA approves a Gerut Licensed Product, we agreed to make a one-time stock option grant to Dr. Gerut with a strike price equal to the closing trading price on the day before the date of such grant.
 
Our obligation to pay royalties to Dr. Gerut with respect to sales by us, our affiliates or any sublicensee of any Gerut Licensed Product in any country (including the U.S.) arises only upon the first commercial sale of a Gerut Licensed Product. Our obligation to pay royalties to Dr. Gerut will continue until June 3, 2016 or such longer period as we continue to receive royalties for such Gerut Licensed Product.
 
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its termination provisions, the Gerut License Agreement and licenses granted under that agreement will continue in effect until the termination of our royalty obligations. After that, all licenses granted to us under the Gerut License Agreement will become fully paid, irrevocable exclusive licenses. We do not view the Gerut License Agreement as covering the use of XIAFLEX® for cellulite, because it does not involve the removal or treatment of fat.
 
 12
 
Other Indications
 
We may enter into certain other license and royalty agreements with respect to other indications that we may elect to pursue.
 
COMPETITION
 
We and our licensees face worldwide competition from larger pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies that are developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and may subsequently develop products that are more effective, safer or less costly than any products that we have developed, are developing, or will develop, or that are generic products. Our success will depend on our ability to acquire, develop and commercialize products and our ability to establish and maintain markets for our products that receive marketing approval. Our marketed indication for PD currently enjoys Orphan Drug Protection until December 6, 2020. Orphan drug status for DC expired on February 2, 2017. For more information on orphan drug designations, please see the discussion below. We may face greater competition, including from biosimilars, after the expiration of the orphan drug designations and the expiration of the 12-year marketing exclusivity under certain laws as further described below in “Public Health Service Act and Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.”
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, reporting, marketing, import, and export of biopharmaceutical products such as those we and our partners are developing and have developed. In addition, manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to comply with mandatory price reporting, discount, and rebate requirements, among other requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in exclusion from program coverage and debarment from government contracts.  Federal law also limits the reimbursement rate Medicaid and Medicare pay providers.  Many states have laws similar to federal laws that regulate marketing and sales within the state and some have imposed price reporting obligations and restrictions on price increases within the state.  The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In the United States, the FDA regulates our and our partners’ products and product candidates as biologics, a drug subset, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Services Act (“PHSA”), and their implementing regulations.
 
Any product labeled for use in humans requires regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety, purity, and potency, and must comply with additional regulatory requirements of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries, such as the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) in Europe and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (the “PMDA”) in Japan. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Clinical and preclinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the applicable regulatory standards, good clinical practices (“GCPs”), and good laboratory practices (“GLPs”), respectively. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate or approved products to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Each trial must be conducted under an FDA Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”). Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, an IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and proposed clinical study protocols among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, notifies the applicant of safety concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or noncompliance. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
 
 13
 
In addition to FDA review and supervision, each trial must also be reviewed, approved and conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), and each trial must include the patient’s informed consent. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRB for approval. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the effectiveness of the biologic, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase sequential process, but the phases may overlap.
 
 
• | Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted in healthy human volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition and test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure‑activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. If possible, Phase 1 trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—Controlled studies are conducted in limited subject populations with a specified disease or condition to evaluate preliminary efficacy, identify optimal dosages, dosage tolerance and schedule, possible adverse effects and safety risks, and expanded evidence of safety. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—These adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials are undertaken in expanded subject populations, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate enough data to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk‑benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for product approval. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



There are typically multiple studies conducted within any given phase to collect the data necessary to support a marketing application. The 21st Century Cures Act, however, provides for FDA acceptance of new kinds of data such as patient experience data and, for appropriate indications sought through supplemental marketing applications, data summaries.  Real world evidence may also be used to assist in clinical trial design and to support marketing applications.  The FDA may also require, or companies may conduct, additional clinical trials for the same indication after a product is approved, referred to as Phase 4 studies. Moreover, FDA requires pediatric studies either before or after product approval, if the product candidate is not eligible for a waiver.  Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, develop additional chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information, including stability, and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements.
 
Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. Moreover, under the 21st Century Cures Act, manufacturers or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must have a publicly available policy concerning expanded access.
 
 14
 
In addition to requirements concerning the conduct of clinical and preclinical trials, the manufacture of investigational biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Sponsors of clinical trials must provide FDA annual updates on their development program and more frequent reports in the case of serious adverse events. Investigational biologics and active ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements.
 
Clinical testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA monitors the progress of all clinical trials that are conducted in the U.S. and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. The FDA can also provide specific guidance on the acceptability of protocol design for clinical trials. The FDA, an IRB, the Company or its partners may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA’s or the IRB’s requirements, the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to the subjects, or based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. The FDA can also request that additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval. During all clinical trials, physicians monitor the patients to determine effectiveness and/or to observe and report any reactions or other safety risks that may result from use of the product candidate.
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, sponsors submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information including information on the chemistry, manufacture and control of the product, to the FDA, in the form of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee, which must be paid at the time of the first submission, if not waived. Orphan products, discussed further below, are not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication.
 
Within 60 days of receiving an application, the FDA determines if the application will be considered filed, meaning that it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA does not accept an application for filing, it must be resubmitted with the FDA requested information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure, and potent, and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate. The FDA also will inspect the product manufacturing facilities and selected clinical trial sites. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless cGMP and GCP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may further refer a BLA to an advisory committee, which is a panel of experts, that recommend whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA aims to complete its review of standard BLAs within ten months from the 60‑day filing date. This timeframe, however, may not be met or may be extended.
 
The FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing, if it determines that the BLA, clinical and pre-clinical trial conduct, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities are acceptable. If the FDA determines that the BLA, clinical or pre-clinical trial conduct, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in a complete response letter (“CRL”), indicating that the application is not ready for approval, and will often request additional testing, clinical trials, or information. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: (1) resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; (2) withdraw the application; or (3) request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has the goal of reviewing resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the BLA.
 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, which may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. The Company or its partners may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our or their efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us or them from marketing our products. Furthermore, the FDA may prevent a sponsor from marketing a product under a label for its desired indications or place other conditions, including restrictive labeling, on distribution as a condition of any approvals, which may impair commercialization of the product. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
 15
 
If the FDA approves the BLA, the product can be marketed to physicians to prescribe in the U.S. The FDA, however, may approve product candidates for fewer or more limited indications or uses than requested, may require significant safety warnings, including black box warnings, contraindications, and precautions, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, surveillance, or other requirements, including REMS, to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals.  For example, the use of XIAFLEX® for the treatment of PD is subject to a REMS which requires health care provider training and certification, healthcare provider risk education, certification of dispensing pharmacies and health care settings, dispenser confirmation that the prescribing physician is certified under the REMS, Endo auditing of certified pharmacies and health settings, and patient risk education. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the risks.
 
After approval, the sponsor must comply with a number of post-approval requirements, including delivering periodic reports to the FDA (i.e., annual reports), submitting descriptions of any adverse reactions reported, biological product deviation reporting, and complying with sampling and distribution requirements, including tracking and tracing requirements and suspect and illegitimate product investigation and notification requirements, ensuring products are properly imported and exported, as well as any other requirements set forth in the FDA’s approval (such as REMS and Phase 4 studies). The holder of an approved BLA is further required to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. The holder must also ensure compliance with other FDA requirements including requirements related to manufacturing, recordkeeping, advertising, marketing, promotion, and certain electronic records and signatures.  For instance, the holder must ensure that approved products are not promoted for unapproved uses and are otherwise marketed in accordance with FDA’s promotional requirements.  Improper promotion can subject the holder to significant enforcement by FDA, other regulatory authorities, and private parties.
 
Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, list their products, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to assess compliance with cGMP which impose procedural and documentation requirements relating to manufacturing, quality assurance and quality control. In some case, after a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and specifications, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.  Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. There also are continuing annual program user fee requirements for any approved products.  Orphan products, however, may be exempt from program fees under certain circumstances.
 
In addition to studies requested by the FDA after approval, a sponsor may conduct other trials and studies to explore use of the approved product for treatment of new indications, which require submission of a supplemental or new BLA and FDA approval of the new labeling claims. The purpose of these trials and studies is to broaden the application and use of the product and its acceptance in the medical community.
 
 16
 
We use, and will continue to use, third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical quantities. We additionally use third-party contract research organizations, clinical trial sites, and outside laboratories to conduct our clinical and preclinical studies. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities, at the facilities of our contract manufacturers and other third parties or at those of our partners that may disrupt production or distribution, disrupt clinical or preclinical studies, or require substantial resources to correct. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in significant regulatory actions. Such actions may include restrictions on a product, studies, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post‑market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, product recalls or withdrawals, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment from receiving government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, and result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.  Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications. Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RIGHTS
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our existing products and the products we acquire or in-license by obtaining and maintaining a strong proprietary position both in the U.S. and in other countries. To develop and maintain such a position, we intend to continue relying upon patent protection, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities. In addition, we intend to seek patent protection whenever available for any products or product candidates and related technology we develop or acquire in the future.

Patents
 
We are the assignee or licensee of various U.S. patents, which have also been issued as patents in various foreign countries. Pursuant to our August 31, 2011 settlement agreement with Auxilium, we are co-owners of U.S. Patent No. 7,811,560, entitled Compositions and Methods for Treating Collagen-Mediated Diseases, a patent relevant to XIAFLEX®, sold by Endo as a treatment for DC and PD. We expect this patent will expire in July 2028. In addition, we have licenses to other pending patent applications. Although we believe these patent applications, if they issue as patents, will provide a competitive advantage, the scope of the patent positions of pharmaceutical firms involves complex legal, scientific and factual questions and, as such, is generally uncertain. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our current patent applications, or the products or product candidates we develop, acquire or license will result in the issuance of patents or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection, will be of any value to us or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by our competitors or otherwise.
 
While we attempt to ensure that our product candidates and the methods we employ to manufacture them do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary rights, competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights. Because patent applications in the U.S. and some other jurisdictions can proceed in secrecy until patents issue, third parties may obtain other patents without our knowledge prior to the issuance of patents relating to our product candidates, which they could attempt to assert against us. Also, since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications.
 
Although we believe that our product candidates, production methods and other activities do not currently infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we cannot be certain that a third party will not challenge our position in the future. If a third party alleges that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may need to obtain a license from that third party, but there can be no assurance that any such license will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Any infringement claims that result in litigation could result in substantial cost to us and the diversion of management’s attention from our core business. To enforce patents issued, assigned or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of other parties’ proprietary rights, we may also become involved in litigation or in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), which could result in substantial costs to us or an adverse decision as to the priority of our inventions. We may be involved in interference and/or opposition proceedings in the future. We believe there will continue to be litigation in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.

As discussed above, we have licensed to Endo our injectable collagenase for the treatment of DC, PD, frozen shoulder, cellulite, canine lipoma, lateral hip fat, plantar fibromatosis, and human lipoma. We also have an issued patent directed to a method of fermenting Clostridium histolyticum to obtain collagenase, namely U.S. Patent No. 10,119,131, issued November 6, 2018 (expiration September 9, 2032).
 
Orphan Drug Designations
 
Two indications, DC and PD, have received orphan drug designation from the OOPD. These indications did not receive the European equivalent of orphan drug designation.
 
The orphan drug provisions of the FDCA provide incentives to biologics sponsors to develop and supply products for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or, for a disease that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product for such disease or condition will be recovered from its sales in the U.S. If there is a product already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity.  Under the orphan regulations, the holder of the first FDA approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity for that product for the orphan indication which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. In the case of DC, orphan drug status expired on February 2, 2017; in the case of PD, orphan drug status expires on December 6, 2020. Orphan exclusivity would not prevent other products from being approved for the same indication or the same biologic from being approved for different indications. If orphan drug designation is granted prior to product approval, companies developing orphan drugs may also be eligible for tax credits for expenses associated with clinical trials, including a 20-year tax carry-forward, and FDA grants. The tax advantages, however, were limited in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Public Health Service Act and Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
 
XIAFLEX® is regulated and marketed as a biologic product pursuant to BLAs. The Company and its partner’s other product candidates will also be regulated and marketed as biologic products pursuant to a BLA.  XIAFLEX® was licensed based on a determination by the FDA of safety, purity, and potency as required under the PHSA. In 2010, Congress enacted the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated licensure pathway for products deemed to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with FDA-licensed reference biological products as well as protections for reference biologics.
 
Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure. During this 12-year period, no application for a biosimilar product can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product, which in the case of XIAFLEX® was 2014, and FDA may not make a biosimilar product approval effective until the expiration of the 12 years, which we believe, in the case of XIAFLEX®, will be 2022.  Not all reference product biologic applications and supplements, however, will qualify for 12 years of exclusivity. For instance, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the 12-year exclusivity period. The BPCIA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent.
 
 19
 
Under the BPCIA, following the expiration of a 12-year reference exclusivity period, the FDA may license under section 351(k) of the PHSA a biologic that it determines is biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product. Biosimilarity means that the section 351(k) product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the section 351(k) product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. To be considered interchangeable, a product must be biosimilar to the reference product, be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient, and, if administered more than once to an individual, the risks in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the product and its reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch. Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing doctor. Licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable product under section 351(k) generally requires less than the full complement of product-specific preclinical and clinical data required for innovator products licensed under section 351(a). Per FDA draft guidance, sponsors of biosimilar and interchangeable products are not required to seek FDA licensure for all of the indications for which the reference product has approval, though interchangeable product sponsors are encouraged to do so.  The FDA has considerable discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence required to demonstrate biosimilarity and interchangeability. Depending on the product, additional periods of regulatory exclusivity may be available.
 
Recently, Congress, the Administration, and administrative agencies have taken certain measures to increase biosimilar competition and thus, decrease biologic prices. By example, in 2019 FDA introduced a draft guidance to facilitate biologic importation. Congress also passed a bill requiring sponsors of BLA approved products to provide sufficient quantities of biologic products on commercially reasonable market based terms to entities developing biosimilar products.
 
Trade Secrets
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
 
It is our policy to require certain employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
