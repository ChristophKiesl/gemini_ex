RMHB is a consumer goods company specializing in brand development of health conscious, hemp-infused food and beverage products. The Company currently markets a lineup of five naturally flavored hemp-infused beverages (Citrus Energy, Black Tea, Mango Energy and Lemonade) and a low-calorie hemp-infused Coconut Lime Energy drink. The Company also offers hemp-infused 2oz. Mango Energy Shots and Mixed Berry Energy Shots. In August 2016 the Company launched Eagle Spirit Spring Water, a line of naturally high alkaline spring water.
 
After developing the beverage products, RMHB completed its first production run in February of 2015. Since then RMHB has had production runs for hemp-infused beverages totaling over 3,900,000 cans. Each beverage contains approximately 50mg (our first production run) to 100mg of hempseed extract and all-natural ingredients. The hemp-infused products are shelf stable (no refrigeration necessary) with a shelf life of two years.
 
During fiscal year 2017, the Company also produced energy shots and Relaxation Brownies.
 
In September 2016, the Company bottled its first high alkaline spring water, Eagle Spirit Spring Water and has completed several production runs since, including approximately 110,000 16.9 oz. bottles and 1,800 2.64-gallon (10-liter) “Bag in a Box.”
 
In March and April 2017, the Company completed additional production runs of its more popular hemp-infused beverages, Citrus Energy and Mango Energy.
 
In August 2017, the Company sold its remaining inventory of Smarterita wine-based beverages. There are currently no plans to resume production of this alcoholic beverage.

Acquisitions
 
Rocky Mountain High Water Company LLC
 
In July 2016, the Company entered into a business alliance with Poafpybitty Family, LLC to launch Eagle Spirit Spring Water, a line of purified, high-alkaline spring water sourced from Native American tribal land in Oklahoma.

-


The agreement calls for the Company to pay a royalty on each gallon of water collected at the spring. Production of filtered spring water filled bottles commenced in August 2016 and sales began in October 2016.
 
In consideration for the 20-year water and surface rights, and a related 10-year renewal option, the Company paid Poafpybitty Family, LLC cash payments of $22,500 and issued a warrant for 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock exercisable at $.03 per share over a three-year period beginning July 27, 2016.
 
The agreement grants the Company an exclusive right to develop land adjacent to the spring for commercial purposes as agreed to by both parties. Additionally, the Company has agreed to grow hemp for experimental or commercial purposes on the land within three years.
 
On November 12, 2016, the agreement with the Poafpybitty Family was amended to give the Company a controlling voting interest of 75% of RMHW, while the Poafpybitty Family received 51% of the equity interest. The amended agreement is being accounted for as a step-acquisition, with the resulting goodwill of $49,911 included in other assets. The Company is obtaining an outside valuation of the rights to use the land and obtain the water described in the agreement. Beginning November 12, 2016, the operations of RMHW are consolidated in the financial statements of RMHB.
 
Investments
 
On July 17, 2015, the Company acquired all of the assets of Dollar Shots Club, LLC. The purpose of the acquisition was to acquire formulas developed by Dollar Shots Club, LLC for inclusion in the Company’s hemp-based energy shots, which were being developed at the time.
 
The Company issued 2,000,000 shares of its common stock to seven individuals who owned 100% of membership units in Dollar Shots Club, LLC.  The investment in Dollar Shots Club, LLC was recorded on the Company’s books at a price of $166,000, which was based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the day the stock was issued.   The assets purchased included the trademark and other intellectual property of the LLC, inventory, all websites and ecommerce sites, goodwill, formulas and all other general intangibles (the “assets”).
 
On September 18, 2015, the Company sold these assets to Dollar Shots Club, Inc. in exchange for 5,000,000 shares of Dollar Shots Club, Inc. common stock. The Company retained the rights to the formulas to the shots so that it could develop a similar hemp-infused energy version of them to be sold under Rocky Mountain High Brands. To the best of the Company’s knowledge, there is no relationship between the Dollar Shots Club entities. The Company fully impaired this investment during the year ended June 30, 2016.

The Company is also currently marketing a two-flavor lineup of energy shots.
 
The Company plans to sell its remaining inventory of these products during the first half of fiscal year 2018. In order to execute this plan, the Company will offer larger discounts to distributors and retailers and higher commissions to its broker network, likely resulting in lower gross profit margins for the first and second quarter of 2018.
 
Our Eagle Spirit Land and Water Company currently markets its naturally high alkaline spring water in two sizes: a 16.9 oz. plastic bottle sold in cases of 24 and a 2.64-gallon (10-liter) Bag in a Box.
 
Strategic Update and Planned Product Offerings
 
The Company has recently updated its long-term strategic plan. Management’s goal is to become the category leader in the hemp-infused beverage market, a segment of the functional beverage market. Functional beverages, or beverages that convey health benefits, are the fastest growing segment within the beverage market.
 
The Company is developing four newly reformulated, sugar-free, non-energy, hemp-infused beverage flavors. In addition to the new formulas, the beverages will feature 12 oz. cans, an all-new look and will replace all current hemp-infused beverage offerings. Two of the four beverage flavors will be carbonated. Flavor choices will be similar to past offerings. Management plans to begin production on the new beverages in February 2018. Marketing will focus on the health benefits of hemp, including Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, amino acids, and natural, plant-based fiber.
 
The Company is also reviewing its other product offerings, but there are no immediate plans to produce additional Relaxation Brownies or energy shots.
 
The Board of Directors is currently evaluating its plans with regard to the Eagle Spirit Water business.
 
The Company also plans to hire a Vice President of Sales and a Director of Marketing during fiscal year 2018.
 
Sales Channels
 
The Company depends upon a network of brokers and distributors to represent its product in the market. During its first year of operation, the Company signed twenty-four distributors across the country. For the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company’s two largest distributors accounted for 50% and 7% of sales, respectively.
 
The various distribution channels differ in costs, customer relationships, complexity and the resources required to operate the channel. We strategically build sales distribution channels to match and reinforce the goals and objectives of our marketing plan. To increase competitiveness and sales, we have a specific sales strategy in order to maximize revenues that includes the following:
 
Direct Selling
 
We utilize direct sales to retailers, which eliminates the delays and additional expense of a standard distribution channel. In this way we are better able to preserve more revenue, and protect capital under the control of the company. Direct selling to certain segments supports our marketing plan that has identified, researched and segmented certain final customers.

We utilize Amazon and our two proprietary websites – www.liverockymountainhigh.com and www.eaglespiritspringwater.com – to sell directly to consumers.
 
Wholesale Distribution
 
Another sales channel includes wholesale distribution. This method is designed for our potential customers who are widely dispersed. Wholesale distribution leaves the selling to wholesalers and retailers specialized in retail sales, which enables us to focus on production. Product is sold to distributors under a variety of terms from cash to credit terms.
Beverage Brokers
 
Beverage brokers develop local, regional, and national product campaigns with attention to long-term sustainable success. They assist in matching brands with the needs of an evolving market. Scheduling appointments, making presentations, securing product approval, and shelf resets, have added greatly to the time line from ship to shelf, making the role of the beverage broker all the more important. Beverage brokers represent a cost-efficient method of doing business for our drink brands. A commission-based beverage broker is a variable cost directly tied to the volume sold.
 
The Company is re-assessing its go-to-market strategy. Specifically, channels of distribution and distributor and broker agreements are being reviewed. Going forward, management plans to focus on key domestic markets.
 
Outsourced Production and Storage Services
 
In May 2016, the Company executed a one-year agreement with MBA Beverage to coordinate the manufacturing of our hemp-infused beverage products. MBA Beverage acted as our outsourced supply-chain management and coordinated every aspect of the manufacturing process. The contract expired in May 2017. We have not executed a new contract with MBA Beverage or any other outsourced production coordinator.
 
Blues City Brewery, LLC (“Blues City”) in Memphis, Tennessee, a subsidiary of City Brewing Company, LLC, has completed all of beverage production and canning to-date. Blues City is an FDA registered facility that is audited annually to ensure compliance with FDA GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) for food safety. MBA Beverage schedules beverage production with Blues City. Upon completion of the production, the Company stores finished product at Blues City, awaiting sale to our distributor network. The Company does not contract with Blues City directly.
 
Sovereign Flavors of Santa Ana, California collaborates with the Company for product formulation under an informal agreement. The Company owns the propriety formulas to our products.
 
Our naturally high alkaline spring water is cold-filtered and packaged by a third-party water processor, Water Event Pure Water Solutions (“Water Event”).
 
Regulatory Requirements
 
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to:
 

• | The production of beverages and other related products; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The preparation and sale of beverage; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since our hemp-based products are derived from industrial hemp containing a tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) level of 0.3% or less, they are not subject to the Controlled Substances Act. The express language of the federal Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) provides that hemp stalk, fiber, oil, and sterilized seed are not controlled as marijuana. Thus, products containing industrial hemp – defined as the cannabis sativa plant containing a THC level of 0.3% or less - have been sold legally in every state in the U.S. for decades. In 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals invalidated U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) regulations that would have banned the manufacture and sale of edible products made from hemp seed and oil. Hemp Industries Ass’n v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 357 F.2d 1012 (9th Cir. 2004). For this reason, U.S. companies may import hemp stalk, fiber, seed and oil, to trade in it, and to use it in the manufacture of products. The Company purchases imported hemp seed extract and uses it in the manufacture of its products. The Company does not have plans to grow marijuana, distribute marijuana or infuse our food or beverage products with marijuana, as defined in the Controlled Substance Act.
 
Our beverage products are not subject to direct FDA approval as the FDA does not perform review testing or approval of food, beverages or dietary supplements. The FDA requires that we manufacture our products in commercial manufacturing facilities that are annually audited to ensure that they pass inspection based on Good Manufacturing Practices for food safety.
 
Possession of hemp in the United States is legal, including possession of the sterilized seed, hemp seed oil, hemp seed flour, hemp seed cake, hulled hemp seeds, hemp clothing, hemp fabrics, hemp fuel or any other product made from industrial hemp. Because the industrial hemp plant is the same species as marijuana, until recently, it has been illegal for U.S. farmers to grow the plant itself. However, in the federal Agricultural Act of 2014, Congress specifically exempted from the CSA cultivation of industrial hemp under agricultural pilot programs authorized by state law.
 
Employees and Independent Contractors
 
The Company currently has five officers and two non-officer employees. The Company uses independent contractors, when necessary, to support operational or back-office functions.
 
Implications of Emerging Growth Company Status
 
As a company with less than $1 billion in revenue in our last fiscal year, we are defined as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act.  We will retain “emerging growth company” status until the earliest of:

• | The last day of the fiscal year during which our annual revenues are equal to or exceed $1 billion; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to in this document as the Securities Act; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in a previous three-year period; or 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The date on which we qualify as a large accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (i.e., an issuer with a public float of $700 million that has been filing reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Exchange Act for at least 12 months). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to SEC reporting companies. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2002; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder non-binding advisory votes; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submit for stockholder approval golden parachute payments not previously approved; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disclose certain executive compensation related items, as we will be subject to the scaled disclosure requirements of a smaller reporting company with respect to executive compensation disclosure; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Present more than two years of audited financial statements and two years of selected financial data in a registration statement for our initial public offering of our securities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of The JOBS Act.  This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.  As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt into the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
 
Because the worldwide market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, is below $75 million, we are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the Exchange Act.  Some of the foregoing reduced disclosure and other requirements are also available to us because we are a smaller reporting company and may continue to be available to us even after we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act but remain a smaller reporting company under the Exchange Act.  As a smaller reporting company we are not required to:
 

• | Have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Present more than two years of audited financial statements in our registration statements and annual reports on Form 10-K and present any selected financial data in such registration statements and annual reports. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
