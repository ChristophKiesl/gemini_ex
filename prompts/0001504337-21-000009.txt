ITEM 1. | Business

GENERAL
We are a manufacturer and premier supplier of quality consumer tissue, parent roll tissue and bleached paperboard. We supply private label tissue to major retailers, including grocery, drug, mass merchants and discount stores. In addition, we produce and supply bleached paperboard to quality-conscious printers and packaging converters, and offer services that include custom sheeting, slitting and cutting. 
STRATEGY
Our long-term strategy is to expand our business to meet the needs of our customers and optimize the profitability of both our Consumer Products and our Pulp and Paperboard businesses. In the near-term, our focus is on reducing debt, optimizing our installed capital projects and improving the operating and cost effectiveness of both segments of our company.
ORGANIZATION
Our business is organized into two operating segments: Consumer Products and Pulp and Paperboard. Sales for these businesses for the last three years are included in the table below:

 | Year Ended December 31, | | Increase (decrease)
(In millions) | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2020 - 2019 | 2019 - 2018
Consumer Products | $ | 1,032.7 | | | $ | 906.8 | | $ | 884.8 | | 13.9 | % | 2.5 | %

 | $ | 1,868.6 | | | $ | 1,761.5 | | $ | 1,724.2 | | 6.1 | % | 2.2 | %

Consumer Products Segment
Our Consumer Products segment sells and produces a complete line of at-home tissue products. Our integrated manufacturing and converting operations and geographic footprint enable us to deliver a broad range of cost-competitive products with brand equivalent quality to our customers. We also sell minor amounts of non-retail products including away from home (AFH) products, parent rolls and contract manufacturing and minor amounts of pulp.
Our Consumer Products Business
We believe that we are the only U.S. consumer tissue manufacturer that solely produces a full line of quality private label tissue products for large retail trade channels with a national footprint. We believe we are able to offer products that match the quality of leading national brands, but generally at lower prices. We utilize independent companies to routinely test our product quality.
In bath tissue, the majority of our sales are high quality two-ply ultra and premium products. In paper towels, we produce and sell ultra quality towels as well as premium and value towels. In the facial category, we sell ultra-lotion three-ply and a complete line of two-ply premium products, as well as value facial tissue. In napkins, we manufacture ultra two- and three-ply dinner napkins, as well as premium and value one-ply luncheon napkins. Value grade products utilizing recycled fiber are also produced for customers who wish to further diversify their product portfolio. We compete primarily in the at-home portion of the U.S. tissue market, which made up approximately 94% of our Consumer Products segment sales in 2020. 
We sell private label tissue products through our own sales force and compete based on product quality, customer service and price. We deliver customer-focused business solutions by assisting in managing product assortment, category management and pricing and promotion optimization. 
Pulp and Paperboard Segment
Our Pulp and Paperboard segment markets and manufactures bleached paperboard for the high-end segment of the packaging industry and is a leading producer of Solid Bleached Sulfate (SBS) paperboard. This segment produces hardwood and softwood pulp, which is primarily used as the basis for our paperboard products or transferred to our Consumer Products business. 

Our Pulp and Paperboard Business
We believe we are one of the four largest producers of bleached paperboard in North America with approximately 15% of the available production capacity in 2020. We also provide custom sheeting, slitting and cutting of paperboard products. 
Our paperboard production consists of folding carton, liquid packaging, cup and plate products, blister and carded packaging, top sheet and commercial printing grades and softwood pulp. 
Folding carton board used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other premium packaging, such as those that incorporate foil and holographic lamination, accounts for the largest portion of our total paperboard sales. We focus on high-end folding carton applications where the heightened product quality requirements provide for differentiation among suppliers, generally resulting in margins that are more attractive than less demanding packaging applications.
Our liquid packaging paperboard is known for its cleanliness and print ability, and is engineered for long-lived performance due to its three-ply, softwood construction. Our reputation for producing liquid packaging meets the most demanding standards for paperboard quality and cleanliness, where consumers have a particular tendency to associate blemish-free, vibrant packaging with the cleanliness, quality and freshness of the liquids contained inside.
With the exception of our capability to supply just-in-time sheeting and narrow rolls, we do not produce converted paperboard end-products, so we are not simultaneously a supplier of and a competitor to our customers in key market segments, notably folding carton and cup. Of the five largest SBS paperboard producers in the United States, we are the only producer that does not convert SBS paperboard into folding cartons, cups, plates or liquid packaging end-use products. We position our independent status to attract a diverse group of loyal customers because when there is increased market demand for paperboard, we do not divert our production to internal uses. 
We can convert paperboard parent rolls to flat sheets and narrow rolls, which expands our in-market service capabilities and allows us to support small and mid-sized folding carton converters that buy sheeted paperboard to convert into packaging end-products. Providing a service platform in this way expands the key folding carton segment of our business and does not compete with our customers in other key market segments.
We utilize various methods for the sale and distribution of our paperboard. The majority of our paperboard is sold to packaging converters in North America through sales managers located throughout the United States, with a smaller percentage channeled through distribution to commercial printers. We directly sell sheeted paperboard products to folding carton converters, merchants and commercial printers. Our principal methods of competing are product quality, customer service and price.
INPUT COSTS
Raw Materials
Wood fiber is our principal raw material, which consists of chips, sawdust and logs. We own and operate a wood chipping facility which we believe bolsters our wood fiber position and provides short-term and long-term cost savings. 
Additionally, we procure a portion of our pulp requirements. Annually, we purchase approximately 330,000 short tons of pulp, the majority of which is bleached hardwood pulp, on the open market through long-term contracts or market transactions.  The Pulp and Paperboard segment purchases approximately 55,000 short tons and the Consumer Products segment purchases approximately 275,000 short tons.  The remaining pulp needs for our Consumer Products segment are supplied internally by the Pulp and Paperboard segment.
In addition to wood fiber, we utilize a significant amount of chemicals in the production of pulp and paper, including caustic, polyethylene, starch, sodium chlorate, latex and specialty process paper chemicals. A portion of the chemicals used in our manufacturing processes, particularly in the pulp-making process, are petroleum-based or are impacted by petroleum prices. 
Transportation
Transportation is a significant cost input for our business. Fuel prices, mileage driven and line-haul rates impact our transportation costs for delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities, internal inventory transfers and delivery of our finished products to customers. 
Energy
We consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity, hog fuel, steam and natural gas. We purchase a significant portion of our natural gas and electricity under supply contracts, most of which are between a specific facility 

and a specific local provider. Under most of these contracts, the providers have agreed to provide us with our requirements for a particular type of energy at a specific facility. Most of these contracts have pricing mechanisms that adjust or set prices based on current market conditions. 
SEASONALITY
Our Consumer Products segment can experience a decrease in shipments during the fourth quarter as a result of retail brand holiday promotions. In addition, customer buying patterns for our paperboard generally result in lower sales for certain grades of our Pulp and Paperboard segment during the first and fourth quarters, compared to the second and third quarters of a given year.
