ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”, “AgroFresh”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global leader in delivering innovative solutions that extend the shelf life of fresh produce. The Company is empowering the food industry with a range of integrated solutions designed to help growers, packers and retailers improve produce freshness and quality while preventing shrinkage and reducing waste.
AgroFresh’s market leadership is underpinned by our global footprint, extensive applied scientific expertise, customer intimacy and a growing portfolio of value-added solutions and mission-critical advisory services. Our key products are sold in approximately 50 countries, and we support customers by protecting an estimated 25,000 fruit storage rooms globally. In addition, we provide in-depth plant physiology expertise and offer a comprehensive list of solutions spanning from near-harvest to post-harvest, and from storage through retail. More importantly, AgroFresh has been able to gain a high level of trust from our customers, which is built on more than 20 years of interaction and support. Our direct market approach, high touch service and science-based model best position us to address our customers’ needs. We believe that this is a key differentiator compared to other companies that offer limited service levels.
The following tables present a breakdown of our revenue based on solutions, crop and geography for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Note: “EMEA” comprises Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “Other” include revenue from pears, citrus, kiwifruit, avocados, bananas and other crops.
AgroFresh’s core business provides solutions to extend the shelf life of fresh produce for both growers and packers. SmartFreshTM, our flagship solution, preserves the texture, firmness, taste and appearance of produce during storage, transportation and retail display. It allows growers and packers to deliver “just harvested” freshness on a year-round basis and enables retailers to increase customer satisfaction with fresh, high quality produce. An integral part of the SmartFresh value proposition is a direct service model providing customers with on-site applications of SmartFresh at their storage facilities together with mission-critical and value-added advisory services. Overall, the SmartFreshTM Quality System offers growers and packers an integrated freshness management solution that is highly effective and easy to deploy.
AgroFresh extended its post-harvest leadership with the acquisition in December 2017 of a controlling interest in Tecnidex Fruit Protection, S.A. (“Tecnidex”) which is based in Valencia, Spain, one of the largest citrus producing and exporting regions in the world. Tecnidex, a leading provider of fungicides, disinfectants and coatings, is primarily focused on the citrus market. Through its portfolio of post-harvest products, packinghouse technology, consulting and after-sale services, Tecnidex improves the quality and value of our customers’ fruit and vegetables while respecting the environment. 
Tecnidex has a broad catalog of solutions that enhance our portfolio, including fungicides that complement our innovative ActiMistTM delivery system of foggable fungicides. The expanded offerings help diversify our revenue by expanding our ability to provide post-harvest solutions to the citrus industry. With this acquisition, AgroFresh expanded its industry-leading post-harvest presence into additional crops and increased its penetration of the produce market in southern Europe, Latin America and Africa. We continually seek opportunities to leverage this range of products across new geographies for both existing and new customers.

Complementing our post-harvest solutions, AgroFresh’s HarvistaTM technology is currently used for near-harvest management of pome fruit (apples and pears), blueberries and cherries (where application is made during the cherry bloom period). Just as SmartFresh revolutionized post-harvest apple storage, we believe Harvista is starting to have a similar impact in the orchard. For apples, Harvista slows ripening, reduces fruit drop and holds fruit on the tree longer to promote better color and fruit size. With maximum flexibility in application timing, it extends the harvest window by allowing growers to factor in ever-changing weather conditions and labor availability. We have found that the combination of Harvista in the orchard and SmartFresh in the storage room results in improved apple quality compared to use of either product individually. When applied to cherries, Harvista offers a minimum 10% increase in yield.
AgroFresh provides freshness solutions across the supply chain, including retail where much of the ripening process and shrinkage occurs for certain crops. This includes avocados, one of the fastest growing fruit categories. Our SmartFresh solution can help produce consistent avocado quality and enable retailers to sell ready-to-eat avocados that do not require ripening at home. As part of the same diversification efforts, SmartFresh can optimize the consumer experience for a wide range of other crops including broccoli, melon, tomato, mango and stone fruit.
Our FreshCloud™ digital technology platform is an example of how we continue to evolve and increase the value we provide to our customers. The FreshCloud platform consists of cloud-based produce monitoring and screening solutions delivering real time information to customers. FreshCloud capitalizes on our decades-long history of innovation and scientific know-how in the physiology of fruits and vegetables combined with our exclusive proprietary software. FreshCloud consists of both enhancements to our existing service offering and customer base and new solutions to reach more crops and steps in the distribution chain. Our newest service is FreshCloudTM Quality Inspection, a mobile quality management service that digitizes what was formerly a manual quality control process and captures, organizes and analyzes quality metrics in real time. We are seeing encouraging customer adoption of FreshCloud Quality Inspection, such as our recently announced agreement with Montague, one of the leading Australian Fruit Growers. We also launched in 2020 our FreshCloudTM Harvest View service, an easy-to-use digital service that complements and enhances the application of Harvista. FreshCloud Harvest View captures, organizes and presents fast and easy-to-access data insights on starch hydrolysis progression. This allows growers to make more timely decisions on when to apply Harvista, which is key to maximize quality and yields and can translate into higher profit potential. In 2021, we plan to link both FreshCloud Harvest View and Quality Inspection into a single platform that will be able to track fruit from the orchard to the retailer. 
We are subject to extensive national, state and local government regulations. We have completed more than 400 comprehensive international health and environmental tests that have shown the AgroFresh family of products, including SmartFresh and Harvista, to be safe for consumers, workers and the environment. AgroFresh products have been approved by over 50 authorities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission.
Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and serve as the foundation for our planned continued growth:

Leading Agricultural Innovator and Solutions Provider with Proprietary Technical Know-How. AgroFresh has been at the forefront of fresh produce preservation solutions since our inception. Our research and development team includes over 40 scientists, more than half with advanced degrees, who are leaders in the fields of plant post-harvest physiology and material science. The acquisition of Tecnidex added significant scientific capabilities to R&D. Beginning with our creation of the commercial market for 1-MCP (a plant growth regulator, or "PGR") applications under the SmartFresh brand for use in the preservation of apples and other crops, we have compiled an extensive and exclusive database of produce physiology and consumer preferences. Building on our proprietary technical knowledge, we have developed an intellectual property portfolio, including over 500 granted and pending patents, that has enabled us to provide comprehensive and innovative solutions to a global customer base. SmartFresh delivers a substantial improvement in storage solutions for apples, pears and other crops, allowing for significantly less waste and greater productivity, as well as a constant supply of high-quality fruit throughout the year. In the U.S., we estimate that 90% of stored apples are treated with 1-MCP, and our SmartFresh technology continues to enjoy a strong leadership position in this treatment protocol. Extending our record of innovation in the post-harvest market, we entered the near-harvest market with the introduction of our patented Harvista technology, which extends the ideal harvest window for apples and pears, and increases production yields for cherries and blueberries to improve harvest management and enhance fruit quality. Building on this success, we entered the fungicide market with ActiMist and subsequently enhanced our fungicide portfolio with the acquisition of Tecnidex in 2017 and by securing supply agreements with some of the world’s leading fungicide companies. Our recent launch of FreshCloud is the latest milestone in our new product innovation. With the FreshCloud platform, we expect to be able to provide customers real time insights about the condition of their fruit using novel artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.

Diversified Global Presence Across All Major Growing Regions. We have established a global footprint with key products approved in over 50 countries that supports customers with more than 25,000 storage rooms globally. Our top ten customers represent less than 15% of the Company's total revenue, a sign of the strength and resilience of our business. The Company's global commercial platform is unique in the post-harvest industry, positioned across six continents, bringing a full suite of AgroFresh solutions and high-touch advisory services to customers in every key produce-growing region. Our ability to deliver in-depth technical services and products across every major continent is a fundamental competitive advantage. We believe our global footprint provides not only a platform for growth but also greater diversification. Our participation in a wide range of markets protects the business from crop size fluctuations in any particular market. For the year ended December 31, 2020, EMEA, North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific (including China and India) represented 50.4%, 21.4%, 18.2% and 10.0% of sales, respectively. The acquisition of Tecnidex meaningfully contributed to our global diversification efforts.
Service-Oriented Business Model Creates Sustainable Competitive Advantages. AgroFresh’s direct service model provides better margins than the industry average, and comprises not only product applications but also mission-critical technical advisory services. Our sales and technical support personnel maintain direct interaction with our customers in areas of product selection, product application best practices, contract negotiations and overall customer service. Furthermore, we currently have over 40 dedicated research and development scientists, about half with advanced degrees, working across seven global AgroFresh locations, numerous research institutes, and customer sites. This infrastructure has allowed us to amass a proprietary database of technical data of applied plant physiology collected throughout our 20+ year history. In 2020, we made approximately 34,000 monitored applications of SmartFresh. Our proprietary database gives us unique insights into the causes of produce spoilage for various crops varieties in different regions as well as best practices for the effective use of SmartFresh and other quality preserving solutions. As a result, our local sales and technical service teams are best positioned to provide custom advice and solutions, giving our customers confidence and peace of mind throughout the year.
We believe FreshCloud can further bolster our integrated offerings with the addition of data-backed solutions for the monitoring of produce quality across the supply chain. FreshCloud is designed to deliver timely, predictive insights that will help our customers improve efficiency and enhance produce freshness. 
We believe that our direct service model, extensive technical know-how and brand loyalty differentiate us from competitors and sustain our competitive strengths.
Strong Momentum and Growth Opportunities Across the Produce Supply Chain. We believe there are significant growth opportunities to expand and diversify our business, supported by our track record of new product introductions and market penetration. 
One key initiative is to increase penetration of existing technologies into current and new geographic markets. While many apple growers and packers in the U.S. and globally have adopted SmartFresh, there is potential for further growth. The market penetration of apples treated with SmartFresh has been growing internationally but remains below the levels achieved in the U.S. We have also concentrated on accelerating penetration of SmartFresh into pears, plums, kiwifruit and persimmons. Based on successful trials with customers, we are also expanding our commercial activities for SmartFresh to increase its use on avocados, bananas, melons, tomatoes, broccoli and mangos, where we believe SmartFresh can optimize the consumer experience for ripeness, color, taste and texture. Related to this effort, we repositioned RipeLock as our brand for control atmosphere packaging- based freshness technology solutions for fruits and vegetables. 
Harvista is another key product where we are actively working to expand geographic and crop regulatory approvals. As of December 31, 2020, Harvista is registered in eleven countries and we are currently working to obtain registrations in more than eight additional countries including the European Union (the "EU"). In the past few years, we received regulatory approval to apply Harvista to cherries in the U.S., blueberries in Chile and apples in Australia, Brazil and New Zealand, and our team is working to achieve similar registrations in other markets. Ahead of the 2020 growing season, we also secured emergency use permits in Italy, Poland and Spain so that growers could utilize and take advantage of the benefits of Harvista ahead of final EU approval anticipated in 2022. The main limitation to accelerated growth of Harvista is the long regulatory approval cycle in important markets like the EU.
The addition of Tecnidex fungicides, disinfectants and coatings has diversified our crop exposure, reduced revenue seasonality and provided new growth opportunities via cross-pollination of Tecnidex technologies into AgroFresh core fruit categories. As a result of all these initiatives, we have successfully diversified our proportion of sales attributable to apples from nearly 90% in July 2015 down to approximately 75% as of December 31, 2020. 
Building on these growth initiatives, we continuously seek opportunities to leverage our research and development (“R&D”) capabilities to commercialize new products for currently unserved markets. At the same time, we are looking at mergers and acquisition ("M&A") opportunities similar to Tecnidex, as another key strategy to enhance our value proposition and drive growth.

Long-Standing Relationships with Highly Diverse Customer Base. We believe our direct service model coupled with our proprietary solutions have helped us develop deep, trusted and long-tenured relationships with a diverse array of global customers including packers, growers and retailers. For more than a decade, we have operated a large team of commercial and technical experts located in key geographies around the world to provide on-site custom advisory services. This infrastructure helps us maintain intimate and consistent interaction with our customers throughout the year to understand all aspects of harvest operations, address a variety of customer-specific issues, and ultimately improve the economics for growers, packers and retailers across the supply chain. As a result of our unique service model and comprehensive solutions, we have cultivated direct customer relationships in approximately 50 countries, and have cultivated strategic customer relationships as a way to penetrate new geographies and markets. 
High Profit Margins, Strong and Consistent Cash Flow Generation. Our technical expertise, long-standing customer relationships and asset-light business model drive attractive, sustainable profit margins. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated gross margins and EBITDA margins of 73% and 31%, respectively1. In addition, we employ an “asset-light”, outsourced production model. We use a single third-party manufacturer for our key active ingredient, 1-MCP, under a long-term contract with strict confidentiality obligations, and several other suppliers to formulate products and provide packaging services. For the manufacturing of coatings, disinfectants and equipment servicing the citrus market, we employ a manufacturing plant in Spain and use several local suppliers to formulate products and assemble equipment. As a result, our manufacturing footprint requires minimal capital investment and manufacturing personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures were $2.5 million, or 1.6% of net sales. Our attractive margin profile coupled with our asset-light solutions result in free cash flow generation, which will be used to reinvest in the business and repay debt. 
Strong Management Team with Deep Industry Experience. Our management team has extensive food, agricultural and chemical industry experience and a proven track record of bringing innovative, value-added solutions to customers and markets around the world. The Company’s management team boasts over 125 years of combined relevant industry experience and is led by Jordi Ferre, our chief executive officer, who has over 25 years of experience in global food operations and manufacturing.
During the past several years, our management team has effectively launched new products, established new partnerships across the supply chain and completed a successful acquisition of the majority control of Tecnidex. Supported by a deep bench of professionals and a track record of execution, we believe our management team has the vision, expertise, and experience to position us for continued success and to implement our business and growth strategies.
1 EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information, and for a reconciliation of EBITDA to net (loss) income.
Industry Overview

Food Preservation and Freshness

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, over 1.3 billion metric tons of food, or approximately one third of the total food produced worldwide, is lost to spoilage or waste each year. Euromonitor reports that retailers are often judged on their fresh food selection. A large percentage of food waste at the retail level is based on qualitative factors related to consumer perception of freshness. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2015 the first-ever domestic goal to reduce food loss and waste by 50 percent by 2030.
Loss or shrinkage along the food supply chain has a variety of causes, including degradation of fresh produce during storage and transportation.
AgroFresh strives to be the guardian of the world’s fresh produce and stands ready to lead the fresh produce industry into a more sustainable future. In 2019, we completed a detailed sustainability study about the influence of SmartFresh on the apple industry. From 2002 to 2018, we estimate that 259,500 metric tons of apple waste were diverted in the U.S., France and Italy alone. This reduced apple spoilage equates to more than 2.5 million metric tons of water. Improving the apple supply chain in those three countries during the same period took more than 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the air. This is equivalent to taking approximately two million cars off the road for one year or eliminating one billion smartphone charges. In other countries throughout the world, we estimate that SmartFresh reduced CO2 emissions by approximately 342,000 metric tons during that same period. Overall, we estimate that our SmartFresh and Harvista solutions reduce an estimated 10,000 metric tons of food waste per day.

Near-Harvest Treatments

We consider applications in the orchard as “near-harvest” since they are applied right before the fruit is harvested and have synergistic effect with our post-harvest solutions. Near-harvest treatments are commonly used to increase the value of crops and reduce harvest losses. The use of Harvista helps pome fruit growers realize better quality and bigger harvest out of their orchards, while providing more control over how and when their fruit ripens. The unique mode of action provides better control of ethylene response, so fruit matures on the grower’s schedule, helping expand the harvest window for optimal color, size and firmness.

Post-Harvest Treatments

Post-harvest treatments to maximize quality and reduce loss include treatments to manage the effects of ethylene and to prevent microbial contamination. Naturally occurring ethylene triggers the acceleration of ripening in certain crops which results in a reduction of post-harvest life.
One class of post-harvest treatments enhances quality and reduces losses by controlling the environment in which produce is stored. Controlled Atmosphere ("CA") and Dynamic Controlled Atmosphere (“DCA”) systems are used to keep stored crops within their optimal ranges of temperature and levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Specific oxygen and carbon dioxide levels can lower respiration in fresh produce and delay ripening. CA systems have been used for many decades with fruits and vegetables to preserve freshness. DCA, a more recent innovation, seeks to adjust levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide dynamically as the produce in storage breathes and matures. CA and DCA are only effective at preserving freshness while the fruit is kept in cold storage. However, 1-MCP treatments have been found to be complementary to these technologies by helping to better maintain the quality of apples and pears during cold storage and maintaining freshness for up to 90 days after they are removed from cold storage.

Our Business
We are an agricultural technology innovator in proprietary advanced technologies that enhance the freshness, quality and value of fresh produce. We currently offer SmartFresh applications at customer sites predominately through a direct service model utilizing third-party contractors. We also provide advisory services based on our extensive knowledge on the use of 1-MCP collected through tens of thousands of monitored applications done as a part of the service model. Our pricing to customers is based on the service provided, not on the product sold. We operate in approximately 50 countries and derive the majority of our revenue working with customers to protect the value of apples, pears and other produce during storage. Harvista is approved for sale in Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Israel, South Africa, Turkey and the United States and are expanding into New Zealand for the 2020-2021 season. LandSpring is being marketed primarily in the U.S. and SmartFresh diversification efforts are being marketed mainly in the U.S., Mexico and South America. ActiMist was launched in the U.S. and is being expanded into other countries subject to regulatory approval. Line extensions and new services are planned for introduction to seek to strengthen our global position in post-harvest storage and to capitalize on adjacent growth opportunities in near-harvest markets.
AgroFresh extended its post-harvest leadership with the acquisition of Tecnidex, a leading provider of fungicides, disinfectants and coatings primarily focused on the citrus market. For over 35 years, Tecnidex has been helping fruit and vegetable producers offer clean, safe and high-quality products to customers in 18 countries with particular strength in the Mediterranean region. Tecnidex offers a broad catalog of solutions that enhance our fungicide offering, expand our R&D capabilities, and enable the Company to leverage ActiMist, an innovative delivery system of foggable fungicides. Our fungicide offerings further diversify our revenue by expanding our ability to provide solutions and service to the citrus industry.
1-MCP, the active ingredient in SmartFresh, LandSpring and Harvista, is an ethylene action inhibitor with a proven ability to maintain freshness and extend the shelf life of certain fresh produce. The 1-MCP molecule is structurally similar to ethylene, a naturally occurring plant hormone that occurs in certain fruits and vegetables. Ethylene helps produce grow and ripen, but it eventually causes over-ripening and spoilage. 1-MCP works by blocking the ethylene receptors in plant cells, which temporarily delays the ripening process, enabling the produce to better maintain the qualities associated with freshness.
Fruits and vegetables are classified as climacteric or non-climacteric, a term referring to the process of fruit maturation. Climacteric fruits can ripen after being picked and produce much more ethylene than non-climacteric fruits, which cannot ripen after harvest. The climacteric event is a stage of fruit ripening associated with higher ethylene production and changes in the fruit including pigment changes and sugar release. The climacteric event marks the peak of edible ripeness, with fruits having the best taste and texture for consumption. The role of SmartFresh is to delay the onset of the climacteric stage until the product is ready for consumption. Apples, pears, kiwifruit, plums, persimmon, bananas, melons, peaches and tomatoes are examples of climacteric fruit. The Company continues to evaluate the commercial value of 1-MCP with a range of other climacteric fruit.

SmartFresh Value Proposition
The SmartFreshTM Quality System, our flagship solution, preserves the texture, firmness, taste and appearance of produce during storage, transportation and retail display. Available in “storage room” and “on-the-move” application formats, the SmartFresh Quality System is the original, most recognizable post-harvest choice to maintain consumer-desired produce freshness and quality, and reduce waste. It allows growers and packers to deliver “just harvested” freshness on a year-round basis and enables retailers to increase customer satisfaction with fresh, high quality produce. An integral part of the SmartFresh value proposition is a direct service model providing customers with on-site applications of SmartFresh at their storage facilities together with mission-critical and value-added advisory services. AgroFresh™ Verified is our proprietary analysis and reporting service that provides confirmation of a successful SmartFresh application in storage rooms. 
The value of SmartFresh with any crop is determined by both the biological efficacy with that crop and the utility value the application delivers to the customer. The biological efficacy with apples is high; apples are sensitive to ethylene, and SmartFresh is effective at delaying ripening. In addition, SmartFresh brings high utility value by helping to keep apples fresh year-round despite their limited harvest window. This has resulted in the widespread adoption of SmartFresh by apple growers and packers throughout the world. The cost of SmartFresh translates into less than one cent per pound of apples in the United States, which is small relative to both the value of the crop and the importance of maintaining the quality of that crop during storage. Retail prices of apples in the U.S. typically range from $1.30-$4.50 per pound depending on the variety. The use of SmartFresh gives growers and packers the ability to store apples from one season to the next without losing their just picked quality characteristics.
Beneficial effects of SmartFresh have been proven across numerous apple varieties throughout the world. SmartFresh is also effective with other crops that are highly sensitive to ethylene, including pears, kiwifruit, plums, persimmons, avocados, melons, tomatoes and broccoli, each of which requires a different application method and supply chain logistics beyond storage rooms. We also offer a corresponding solution for flowers, marketed under the EthylBloc brand name through two strategic partners that have a strong position in the global flower market.
AgroFresh’s business historically has been highly seasonal, driven by the timing of apple and pear harvests in the northern and southern hemispheres. The first half of the year is when the southern hemisphere harvest occurs, and the second half of the year is when the northern hemisphere harvest occurs. Since the northern hemisphere harvest of our two core crops of apples and pears is typically larger, a significant portion of our sales and profits are historically generated in the second half of the year. In addition to this seasonality, factors such as weather patterns may impact the timing of the harvest within the two halves of the year. Crop diversification is an important way to achieve balanced revenues across the year, and the ability to service the citrus segment provides an opportunity for the Company to increase revenue in the fourth and first quarters, which are the two strongest quarters for citrus crops. Our acquisition of a controlling interest in Tecnidex and an increased presence in the citrus category has moderately reduced the historic concentration of sales in the second half of the year.
SmartFresh Service Model

We believe that we have developed deep, trusted relationships with our customers by combining our effective SmartFresh product with application expertise and trusted advisory services. Over the past decade we have amassed a valuable proprietary database of technical information on the best practices for the effective use of SmartFresh on a wide range of apple and pear varieties, since each fruit and fruit variety requires a different treatment protocol. The advisory services component utilizes this information to help maximize the profitability of our customers’ operations. 
Harvista

Complementing our post-harvest solutions, Harvista is used for near-harvest management of apples, pears, cherries and blueberries. Our Harvista product line includes proprietary 1-MCP formulations that are specifically designed to slow ripening, reduce fruit drop and hold fruit on the tree longer to promote better color and fruit size, thereby bringing new benefits to the grower. With maximum flexibility in application timing, it extends the harvest window by allowing growers to factor in ever-changing weather conditions and labor availability, providing peace of mind. We have found that the combination of Harvista in the orchard and SmartFresh in the storage room results in improved fruit quality metrics compared to use of either product individually.
Harvista extends the “ideal harvest window” for up to an additional 14 days. This added flexibility creates significant benefits both in terms of harvest logistics and crop profitability. Widening the harvest window allows for better scheduling and the optimization of limited resources, such as harvest crews and equipment. Overall, the value of the crop is enhanced by bigger average fruit size, better color and fewer defects.
Table of Contents

We offer Harvista for apples, pears, cherries and blueberries through a pre-scheduled application service including ground and/or aerial applications depending on the crop and growing region. Typically, our technical staff designs the protocol in consultation with the customer, and either a third-party service provider or the customer makes the application. 
Harvista is currently available in Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Israel, South Africa, Turkey and the United States and we are expanding into New Zealand for the 2020-2021 season. In addition to apple and pear crops, Harvista has received approval for applications to cherries in the U.S. and blueberries in Chile. Additional registrations and label expansions are expected to be pursued as new formulations and/or crop concepts are validated.
FreshCloud
We continue to evolve and expand our FreshCloud digital technology service platform of produce monitoring and screening solutions. FreshCloud Quality Inspection is a proprietary cloud-based mobile quality management service that digitizes what was formerly a manual quality control process to capture, organize and analyze quality metrics in real time. The service combines digital information from many different physical and digital sources and locations, including analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. This allows growers, packers, shippers and retailers to drive accuracy and consistency across their operations. FreshCloud Harvest View is an easy-to-use digital service that complements Harvista. FreshCloud Harvest View captures, organizes and presents fast and easy-to-access data insights on starch hydrolysis progression, thereby enabling growers to make timely decisions on when to apply Harvista, which is key to maximizing quality and yields and can translate into higher profit potential. FreshCloud Storage Insights combines proprietary technology and data analytics in the storage room to offer customers real-time access to unique insights into the condition of their stored fruit. FreshCloud Transit Insights combines sensor technology and proprietary algorithms to provide insights into the condition and quality of fruit during transit.
LandSpring
LandSpring technology is a PGR for use on seedlings to help them withstand transplanting and other stresses encountered in the field. LandSpring suppresses the ethylene signals that would prompt a stress event in the seedling and reduce growth. Among the number of protective benefits, this technology makes seedlings less sensitive to stresses such as heat, cold, UV radiation, drought, flooding and salinity that often occur after planting. When applied before transplanting, LandSpring results in greater plant vigor and a healthier crop that is better able to withstand adverse environmental conditions and give growers the opportunity to increase yield.
Marketing and Sales
AgroFresh's global sales teams are organized geographically across the Europe/Middle East, North America, South America and Asia Pacific regions designed to drive growth. To accelerate new business development activities, there is an additional sales leadership team for diversification.
The Company's core post-harvest business includes solutions designed to improve yields for growers and packers. These solutions include SmartFresh, Harvista, ActiMist, FreshCloud and a large range of fungicides, disinfectants, coatings and packinghouse equipment, marketed under the brands Textar, Teycer and Control-TecTM, respectively.
The technical sales support group supports the sales team and runs customer-specific trials for local crop varieties or specialized storage and distribution conditions and conducts follow-up with customers. This team works closely with customers to provide advice on appropriate protocols for SmartFresh, Harvista and other product applications depending on crop, variety, region, and climatic conditions. The technical sales support group draws on our extensive knowledge base of 1-MCP applications across all regions and conditions.
The marketing function is organized on a global and regional basis. This consists of corporate brand/image stewardship and regionally-driven marketing management including country-specific marketing strategies, plans and tactics to drive growth and customer penetration. Marketing personnel are embedded within the Company’s operating regions to provide maximum ability to collaborate with local sales teams and customers, and capitalize on business opportunities. 

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2020, 2019 or 2018. 

Competition

We estimate the size of the core post-harvest market to be approximately $500 million on a global basis. The post-harvest solutions offered include 1-MCP-based solutions, fungicides and coatings, representing approximately 36%, 20% and 24% of the total market, respectively. The market for the use of 1-MCP is evolving and we have faced growing competition since the expiration of the 1-MCP use patent in 2014. We estimate that citrus applications represent approximately 60% of the total core 
Table of Contents

post-harvest market, which is why we are focused on seeking to grow in this important crop segment. The market for post-harvest solutions is fragmented with various regional suppliers. AgroFresh, Decco (UPL Limited), JBT FoodTech (JBT Corporation) and Pace (Sumitomo Chemical) are the four leading providers that account for an estimated 60% of global post-harvest sales. Other regional and local companies, mainly in citrus, account for the remaining 40% of post-harvest sales. Additional key players in the post-harvest industry include fungicide suppliers, such as Syngenta and Janssen PMP, which hold post-harvest registrations of fungicides previously approved for pre-harvest applications, and which use post-harvest companies, including AgroFresh, to distribute their products. In the near-harvest segment, ReTainTM is a competitive technology to Harvista that is offered by Valent (Sumitomo Chemical) in all regions except for the EU. We believe that the principal factors of competition in our industry include reputation, product quality, customer service and customer intimacy, product innovation, technical service and value creation. We believe that we compete favorably with competitors on the basis of these and other factors. See the subsection titled “Competitive Strengths” above.
Research and Development

Research and development plays an important role at AgroFresh in providing technical support to our customers as well as developing innovative new offerings and line extensions of existing products. Research and development is a truly global function with less than half of our R&D resources located in facilities in North America, and the remainder across our other regions. During fruit harvest times (August to November in the Northern Hemisphere and late January to early May in the Southern Hemisphere), we hire additional third-party contract scientists to assist AgroFresh in the execution of experiments involving Harvista, SmartFresh and ActiMist technologies. Most of the regional research and development facilities focus on business aligned research and development initiatives to develop line extensions and create new products. Research and development makes use of core competencies in a number of technical areas including post-harvest physiology, analytical chemistry, regulatory sciences, regulatory affairs, formulation science, formulation process development, organic chemistry and delivery systems. Initiatives focused on next generation solutions utilize expertise in material science, molecular biology, post-harvest pathology, diagnostics and sensor technology.
Intellectual Property

We are a technology-based solutions provider and, as such, rely on a combination of important intellectual property strengths, including licenses, patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, service providers and vendors that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential including, but not limited to, information related to our proprietary manufacturing process and SmartFresh service model. In the normal course of business, we provide our intellectual property and/or our products protected by our intellectual property to third parties through licensing or restricted use agreements.
Today a majority of our SmartFresh applications use SmartFresh ProTabsTM, an application method patented through 2022. Harvista formulations are patent protected through at least 2027. We continue to invest in application technologies as a means to provide our customers with the most relevant, convenient and effective solutions for their specific operations. Our impressive portfolio of intellectual property underpins our global go-to-market strategy and totals more than 500 granted patents in over 30 countries. 
Regulation and Compliance

We are subject to extensive national, state and local government regulation, and the Company has a regulatory team that we believe is best in class, which leverages a global network of highly-experienced regulatory consultants. Through this network, we have successfully obtained registrations for SmartFresh, Harvista and LandSpring in every country where the review process has been completed, and the registration process for Harvista continues in many additional countries. We have completed more than 400 comprehensive international health and environmental tests that have shown the AgroFresh family of products, including SmartFresh and Harvista, are safe for consumers, workers and the environment. 1-MCP, the active ingredient in the AgroFresh products, is metabolized by the natural processes in apples and other fruits and leaves no residue. The products have been approved by over 50 authorities including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission. We do not anticipate any significant problems in obtaining future required licenses, permits or approvals that are necessary to expand our business. We leverage our regulatory capabilities as we expand the fungicide product lines into new countries.
