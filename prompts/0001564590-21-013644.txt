Company Overview
 Surgalign Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “our” or “us”), (formerly known as RTI Surgical Holdings, Inc. (“RTI”)) is a global medical technology company focused on advancing the science of spine care by delivering innovative solutions, including the application of digital technologies, to drive superior patient outcomes. We have a broad portfolio of spinal hardware implants, including solutions for fusion procedures in the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine, motion preservation solutions for the lumbar spine, and a minimally invasive surgical implant system for fusion of the sacroiliac joint. We also have a portfolio of advanced and traditional orthobiologics, or biomaterials. In addition to our spinal hardware and biomaterials portfolios, we are developing an Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence digital surgery platform called ARAITM   (referred to “ARAI”) to enable digital spine surgery, which we believe is one of the most advanced artificial intelligence technologies being applied to surgery. ARAI is designed to automatically segment, identify, and recognize patient anatomy to autonomously assist the surgeon throughout the surgical procedure. This proprietary artificial intelligence-based platform system is an intelligent anatomical mapping technology designed to assist surgeons by allowing them to remain in safe anatomical zones, and to enhance surgical performance. We plan to leverage our digital surgery platform to improve patient outcomes and drive adoption of our spinal hardware implants and biomaterials products. We are developing a pipeline of new innovative technologies that we plan to integrate with our digital surgery platform. We currently market and sell products to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and healthcare providers in the United States and in more than 40 countries worldwide. We are headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, with commercial, innovation and design centers in San Diego, CA; Marquette, MI; Wurmlingen, Germany; and Warsaw, Poland.
 
OEM Disposition
 On July 20, 2020, we completed the disposition of our original equipment manufacturer businesses (“OEM Businesses”), and became a business focused on spinal implants and technology. We divested the OEM Businesses pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Equity Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 13, 2020, as amended by that certain First Amendment to the Equity Purchase Agreement dated as of March 6, 2020, that certain Second Amendment to the Equity Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 27, 2020 and that certain Third Amendment to the Equity Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 8, 2020 (as amended the “OEM Purchase Agreement”), by and between us and Ardi Bidco Ltd. (“Ardi” or the “Buyer”), an entity owned and controlled by Montagu Private Equity LLP, and the agreements ancillary to the OEM Purchase Agreement (the “Transactions”). As a result of the disposition, among other things, our OEM Businesses and business related to processing donated human musculoskeletal and other tissue and bovine and porcine animal tissue in producing allograft and xenograft implants using BIOCLEANSE®, TUTOPLAST® and CANCELLE® SP sterilization processes were sold to the Buyer and its affiliates for a purchase price of $440 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Further, pursuant to the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, we sold to the Buyer and its affiliates all of the issued and outstanding shares of RTI OEM, LLC (which, prior to the Transactions, was converted to a corporation and changed its name to “RTI Surgical, Inc.”), RTI Surgical, LLC (which, prior to the Transactions, was converted to a corporation and changed its name to “Pioneer Surgical Technology, Inc.”), Tutogen Medical (United States), Inc. and Tutogen Medical GmbH. The Transactions were previously described in the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed by us with the SEC on June 18, 2020. Subsequent to the consummation of Transactions, our name was changed to Surgalign Holdings, Inc., operating as Surgalign Spine Technologies. Where obvious and appropriate from the context, references herein to we, or us refer to the Company including the disposed OEM Businesses.
 The OEM Businesses met the criteria within Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205-20 – Discontinued Operations, to be reported as discontinued operations because the Transactions were a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our 
 1


operations and financial results. Therefore, we are reporting the historical results of the OEM Businesses including the results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations, and related assets and liabilities were retrospectively reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. Unless otherwise noted, applicable amounts in the prior year have been recast to conform to this discontinued operations presentation. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” of this Exhibit for additional information. Unless otherwise indicated, the following information relates to continuing operations. A more complete description of our business prior to the Transactions is included in Item 1. “Business”, in Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on June 8, 2020.
 
Acquisition 
 On October 23, 2020 we completed the acquisition of Holo Surgical Inc. (“Holo Surgical”) pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2020 (the “Holo Surgical Purchase Agreement”), by and among us, Roboticine, Inc. (the “Seller”) and the other parties signatory thereto. Holo Surgical is a private technology company that is developing ARAI digital surgery platform to enable digital spine surgery. As consideration for the transactions contemplated by the Holo Surgical Purchase Agreement, at closing, we paid to the Seller $30 million in cash and issued to the Seller 6,250,000 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $12.3 million. In addition, the Seller will be entitled to receive contingent consideration from us valued in an aggregate amount of $50.6 million as of October 23, 2020, which must be first paid in shares of our common stock (in an amount up to 8,650,000 shares) and then paid in cash thereafter, contingent upon and following the achievement of certain regulatory, commercial and utilization milestones by specified time periods occurring up to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the closing. The number of shares of common stock issued as contingent consideration with respect to the achievement of a post-closing milestone, if any, will be calculated based on the volume weighted average price of the common stock for the five (5) day trading period commencing on the opening of trading on the third trading day following the achievement of the applicable milestone. In connection with the contingent consideration, we have agreed not to take certain actions that could affect the ability to achieve the milestones related to the contingent consideration.
 

COVID-19
 The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the corresponding governmental response, has had significant negative effects on the majority of the U.S. economy and has adversely affected the entire spine market. The consequences of the outbreak and impact on the economy continues to evolve and the full extent of the impact is uncertain as of the date of this filing. The outbreak has already had, and continues to have, a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and has significantly disrupted our operations.
 At times throughout 2020, many hospitals and other medical facilities canceled elective surgeries, reduced and diverted staffing and diverted other resources to patients suffering from COVID-19 and limited hospital access for non-patients, including our direct and indirect sales representatives. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgeons and their patients have been required, or are choosing, to defer procedures in which our products would be used, and many facilities that specialize in the procedures in which our products would be used have closed or reduced operating hours. These circumstances have negatively impacted the ability of our employees and distributors to effectively market and sell our products. In addition, even after the pandemic subsides and/or governmental orders no longer prohibit or recommend against performing such procedures, patients may continue to defer such procedures out of concern of being exposed to COVID-19 or for other reasons.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused adverse effects on general commercial activity and the global economy, which has led to an economic slowdown and recession, and which has adversely affected our business, operating results or financial condition. The adverse effect of the pandemic on the broader economy has also negatively affected demand for procedures using our products, and could cause one or more of our distributors, customers, and suppliers to experience financial distress, cancel, postpone or delay orders, be unable to perform under a contract, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business. This could impact our ability to provide products and otherwise operate our business, as well as increase our costs and expenses.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to and could continue to lead to severe disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase our cost of future capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets in the future.
 In response to the COVID-19 novel coronavirus pandemic and the resulting federal and local guidelines, we furloughed or reduced the hours of a majority of its U.S.-based employees during the second quarter of 2020. While our employees have since returned to work, we cannot predict when its operations will return to pre-pandemic levels and we will continue to carefully monitor the situation and the needs of the business.
 The above and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Although vaccines have recently been made available, it remains uncertain when our business will return to normal operations. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business will 
 2


depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including the possibility that new adverse information may emerge concerning COVID-19 and additional actions to contain it or treat its impact may be required.
 Going Concern
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that we will continue in operation one year after the date these financial statements are issued, and we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $44.0 million and an accumulated deficit of $485.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a loss from continuing operations of $194.2 million. We have incurred losses from operations in the previous two fiscal years and did not generate positive cash flows from operations in fiscal year 2020. 
 On February 1, 2021, we closed a public offering and sold a total 28,700,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.50 per share, less the underwriter discounts and commissions. We received net proceeds of $40,467,000 from the offering after deducting the underwriting discounts and commission of $2,583,000. 
 We project we will continue to generate significant negative operating cash flows over the next 12-months and beyond.  In consideration of i) COVID-19 uncertainties, ii) negative cash flows that are projected over the next 12-month period, iii) the income taxes to be paid related to the gain on sale associated with the OEM Businesses, iv) uncertainty regarding potential settlements related to ongoing litigation and regulatory investigations, and v) approximately $9 million of the total contingent consideration of $50.6 million are expected to become due to the former owners of Holo Surgical if regulatory approval in the US is obtained in 2021, which would paid through combination of common stock and cash; we have forecasted the need to raise additional capital in order to continue as a going concern.  The Company’s operating plan for the next 12-month period also includes continued investments in its product pipeline which will necessitate additional debt and/or equity financing in addition to the funding of future operations through 2021 and beyond. 
 In consideration of the inherent risks and uncertainties and the Company’s forecasted negative cash flows as described above, management has concluded that substantial doubt exists with respect to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Management is planning to raise additional equity financing and will attempt to curtail discretionary expenditures in the future, if necessary, however, in consideration of the risks and uncertainties mentioned, such plans cannot be considered probable of occurring at this time.  
 The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company’s ability to meet its funding requirements on a continuous basis, to maintain existing financing and to succeed in its future operations. The Company’s financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.
 
Segments
 Prior to the disposition of the OEM Businesses, the Company operated two reportable segments: Spine and OEM. Subsequent to the disposition, the Company operates one reportable segment: Spine.
Strategy
 Our goal is to establish ourselves as a global innovator of novel and proprietary technologies and become a leader in the spine market. To achieve our goal, we are pursuing the following strategies: 

• | Leverage our digital surgery platform to improve patient outcomes and drive adoption of our spine implants and biomaterials products. We believe ARAI is one of the most advanced artificial intelligence technologies being applied to surgery, designed to autonomously assist the surgeon throughout the surgical procedure by generating an augmented reality in the surgical field and real-time useful perioperative information such as alerts to ensure the correct operative plan is being followed, which we believe will decrease surgical complications, reduce surgical times, and improve patient outcomes. If we receive regulatory clearance for ARAI, we believe the highly innovative nature of the technology will provide us with access to a broader surgeon customer base and may enhance our overall brand awareness as an innovative spine surgery company. We also believe that surgeon adopters of our ARAI platform may broadly adopt our spinal hardware and biomaterials products.

dedicated engineers and scientists with expertise in product design and development. We plan to continue to deepen our relationships with thought-leading surgeons to develop clinically validated procedures and products that deliver better patient outcomes. We also plan to create seamless integration between our products and procedures and our digital surgery platform.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Validate our innovative products with clinical evidence. We have a history of investing in clinical efficacy and outcomes studies to validate our products with peer-reviewed clinical evidence. There are over 100 peer-reviewed clinical publications spanning our portfolio, including Coflex, HPS 2.0, TETRAfuse, and our ARAI digital surgery platform. We are investing in building a larger research and clinical affairs team that will bolster our clinical evidence. We plan to gather real-world clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of our new innovative products. We plan to continue collaborating with our surgeon customers and key opinion leaders to share clinical data analyses through peer-reviewed scientific publications and conference presentations to the spine surgery and medical community. We believe such clinical data will bring increased awareness of our products and technologies and attract surgeon and patient interest.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow our international business. We have strong commercial and research and development infrastructure outside the United States. We plan to focus our international commercial efforts on certain key markets that we believe represent a current annual market opportunity of $1.0 billion. We have a direct sales channel in several markets including Germany, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. We maintain a hybrid sales channel in other key markets throughout Europe and Asia where we plan to evaluate the potential for conversion to direct sales channels in order to enhance our market penetration. To facilitate continued growth of our international business, we plan to introduce multiple new innovative products to our surgeon customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategically pursue acquisition, license, and distribution opportunities. We have experience identifying acquisition, license, and distribution opportunities and integrating new technologies to complement our product portfolio. We plan to strategically use these business development activities to supplement our internal innovations and fill key product portfolio needs. For example, in October 2020 we acquired Holo Surgical Inc., a private technology company developing a differentiated digital spine surgery platform to address the limitations of current computer-assisted spine surgery and robotics systems.

Industry Overview
 The global spine surgery industry can be broken into various markets that align with the treatment procedures for patients suffering with back-related pain and other conditions. The most prevalent markets are spine implants, composed of implantable devices to aid in both fusion and motion preservation procedures and the biomaterials market consisting of human-derived and synthetic bone growth substitute products. Spine Implants 
 The global spine implants annual market opportunity was estimated at $9.9 billion in 2019, with most revenues being generated from spinal fusion devices. Fusion devices are designed and developed to aid in the restoration of spinal alignment and to provide fixation during the fusion process. Conversely, motion preservation devices are designed predominantly to stabilize the spine and allow for motion of the segments. Spine implants can be surgically applied via traditional open surgery or via minimally invasive surgery. We provide devices in both segments of the spine implant market and via both surgical methodologies. 
Biomaterials 
 The global biomaterials annual market opportunity was estimated at $2.8 billion in 2019. The biomaterials segment covers a large range of bone growth substitutes, including growth factors, cellular allografts, DBMs, traditional allografts, and synthetic bone graft substitutes. Biomaterials are utilized during spine surgery procedures to promote fusion by substituting or augmenting the normal regenerative capacity of bone. 
Enabling Technologies 
 A relatively new and emerging segment to the spine surgery market is enabling technologies. These technologies are designed to aid surgeons in the treatment of spinal conditions by providing information and tools to enhance treatment planning and execution. Major categories within this segment include surgical navigation systems, robotic targeting devices and pre-surgical planning software. 
Our Products 
 We have a broad portfolio of spine implants, including solutions for fusion procedures in the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine, motion preservation solutions for the lumbar spine, and a minimally invasive surgical implant system for fusion of the sacroiliac joint. We also have a broad portfolio of biomaterial products. 
Spine Implants 
 Most of our revenues related to the spine implants portfolio are generated from spinal fusion devices. Fusion devices are designed and developed to aid in the restoration of spinal alignment and to provide fixation during the fusion process. Conversely, motion preservation devices are designed to stabilize the spine and allow for motion of the segments. Sacroiliac joint fusion implant systems are designed to relieve sacroiliac joint pain. We provide devices in each of these three segments of the spinal hardware implant market. 
 
ThoracoLumbar and Cervical Spine Fusion Devices 
 We offer a broad portfolio of cervical, thoracic and lumbar interbody (e.g., Fortilink TETRAfuse cages) and fixation (e.g., Streamline MIS/Degen/OCT pedicle screws) devices for conventional spine fusion procedures including Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF), Posterior Cervical Fusion (PCF), Posterior LumbarInterbody Fusion (PLIF), Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF), Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (ALIF) and Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion (LLIF).
Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Devices 
 We are a market-leader in the sacroiliac joint, or SI, fusion segment of the spinal hardware implant market. Our SImmetry System allows for minimally invasive SI joint fusion surgery that eliminates the movement of the joint in two ways: 

1. | True SI joint fusion – The surgeon decorticates the joint surfaces with special instruments, in accordance with orthopedic principles, to create the appropriate environment to fuse the joint.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Immediate fixation – By placing an implant across the joint, the joint is instantly immobilized, allowing fusion.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Two-year data from the EVoluSIon study showed high rates of joint fusion and statistically significant decreases in opioid use, pain and disability scores, as well as the possibility of faster recovery times.

Motion Preservation Devices 
 Our motion preservation portfolio includes the Coflex Interlaminar Stabilization device, the only FDA PMA-approved implant for the treatment of moderate to severe lumbar spinal stenosis in conjunction with direct decompression. Coflex is the first and only posterior lumbar motion preservation solution with Level I evidence, the highest possible level of clinical data, from two prospective, randomized studies against two treatment options—decompression alone and decompression with fusion—across two countries, the United States and Germany. Coflex has demonstrated long-term clinical outcomes for durable pain relief and stability. The device has been implanted in more than 163,000 patients worldwide. 
Biomaterials 
 We have a significant portfolio across the biomaterials market for spinal fusion procedures. Our portfolio of biomaterials includes products ranging from innovative tissue-based solutions to advanced synthetic bone graft substitutes for a range of surgical applications. Our biomaterials products complement our spine implants product line with the synergistic goal to improve fusion rates. 
Cellular Allograft 
 The ViBone family of products, supplied by Aziyo Biologics, Inc. (“Aziyo”), is a next-generation viable cellular allograft bone matrix processed using a proprietary method optimized to protect and preserve the health of native bone cells to potentially enhance new bone formation. 
Demineralized Bone Matrices 
 DBM formulations are designed to provide naturally occurring bone proteins and other growth factors at varying stages of the bone healing process. We offer a broad DBM portfolio, which includes putty, strip and boat configurations for various surgical applications to provide a natural scaffold for bone ingrowth and osteoinductive potential to facilitate fusion. 
Synthetic Bone Growth Substitutes 
 Our synthetic bone growth substitutes (“BGS”) portfolio, includes the nanOss family of products supplied by RTI Surgical, Inc., which provide osteoconductive nano-structured HA and an engineered extracellular matrix bioscaffold collagen carrier to provide a natural bone growth solution. 
 
ARAI Platform 
 Our ARAI platform is an advanced digital surgery guidance platform that combines 3D visualization, data analytics, and machine learning designed to improve patient outcomes, reduce operation time and decrease surgical complications. It is currently being developed and prepared for regulatory submission, and we believe it will be one of the most advanced artificial intelligence technologies being applied to surgery, designed to automatically identify and segment patient anatomy for autonomously assisting surgeons with spine surgery navigated guidance. 
 The ARAI platform is an intelligent anatomical mapping technology designed to assist surgeons by allowing them to remain in safe anatomical zones while enhancing surgical performance to facilitate improved patient outcomes. We plan to make an FDA 510(k) premarket submission in the first quarter of 2021 and submit a CE mark application in Europe in 2022. 
 The ARAI platform is designed for an ergonomic and comfortable augmented reality experience for the 3D visualization of internal anatomy without soft-tissue exposure. The platform leverages imaging technology to display and visualize the patient’s internal anatomy in real-time. The visualization of the virtual internal anatomy responds and adapts to the surgeon’s 3D perspective and is displayed directly onto the surgical field consistent with the surgeons’ training and workflow. The platform also leverages artificial intelligence-based algorithms to autonomously identify, label, segment, and analyze bony, soft tissue, solid organ, vascular, and nervous system anatomy without any human intervention. ARAI has been designed with a unique setup process of quickly establishing the synchronization between virtual images and the patient’s real anatomy, a process called registration. Many computer-assisted spine surgery and robotics systems have long setup requirements and registration times that can delay the surgical procedure, leading to inefficiencies cited as a major reason why surgeons have not yet widely adopted navigation and robotic technology. The machine-learning algorithms provide suggestions for optimal implant placement for automatic presurgical planning and aid the surgeon in executing a plan with intraoperative guidance including recommendations and alerts.

Research and Development
 Since the launch of Surgalign in July 2020, we have focused on returning to a legacy of innovation, quality, and clinical validation in the design and development of our products. Instrumental to this focus is creating an R&D organization centralized in San Diego, California. This new center of excellence will continue to be supported by our strong capabilities in Wurmlingen, Germany. We have new capabilities in Poland, acquired through the Holo Surgical acquisition, that bring us expertise in augmented reality, machine learning, and software development. We have also maintained our strategic partnership with RTI Surgical, subsequent to the disposition of our OEM Businesses, to support our spine implants and biomaterials businesses. 
 Our short-term product development efforts will focus on initiatives to enhance our interbody cage offerings, fill focused gaps in our biomaterials portfolio and develop a new flagship posterior fixation system. We believe that doing so will allow us to better compete at the procedural level. We will also continue to work on developing differentiated technologies and generating the necessary clinical data to drive demand and support appropriate reimbursement. 
 Aligning with our recent acquisition of Holo Surgical and our commitment to leading in digital surgery, we will also focus on bringing the Holo Surgical technology to market. Future priorities for building out a world-class digital surgery platform include seamless integration with our hardware portfolio, the expansion into additional therapies, and the reimagination of procedural planning and workflow execution. This will position us to differentiate our company in the enabling technologies space and give surgeons access to better information, faster, to translate into enhanced treatments and patient care. 
 In fall of 2020, we received regulatory clearance for a family of 3D printed titanium Interbody implants which we are planning to launch in the U.S. and international markets in early 2021. In 2019, we launched new implants and product enhancements in spine developed by our research and development teams. January 2018 marked the first clinical use of the Fortilink-TS and Fortilink-L product systems, which were followed by the full commercial launch of the Fortilink-TS system in May 2018. The Fortilink systems are the second and third in a family of devices to incorporate our TETRAfuse 3D Technology, the first 3D printed polymer-based implant material designed to participate in fusion. Additionally, in 2018 we introduced and launched ViBone Viable Bone Matrix for exclusive distribution in the United States. Early in 2020, we extended the TETRAfuse 3D Technology into the ALIF space with the release of the Fortilink-A interbody device. In November of 2020, we and Aziyo expanded our distribution agreement and announced the line extension of ViBone Moldable with handling improvements for better operating room experience. Enhancements were made to the Streamline OCT system, continuing to improve our features and options; performance improvements were made to our synthetic biomaterials line with the release of nanOss 3D Plus. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our business depends upon the significant know-how and proprietary technology we have developed and curated. To protect this know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of trade secret laws, patents, licenses, trademarks and confidentiality agreements. The intended effect of these intellectual property rights is to define zones of exclusive use of the covered intellectual property. The duration of patent rights generally is 20 years from the date of filing of priority application, while trademarks, once registered, generally have a term of 10 years but can be renewed so long as the trademarks continue to be used. Our trademarks and service marks provide our company and our products with a certain degree of brand recognition in our markets.  However, we do not consider any single patent, trademark or service mark material to our business strategy, financial condition or results of operations.  Further, we have also entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies.  
 Our U.S. and foreign holdings include, without limitation, patents, patent applications and trade secrets relating to or covering certain synthetic bone graft substitutes; interbody fusion and motion implants; spinal and orthopedic plates; spinal rods, cables and screws and spinal fixation systems and related instrumentation.  
 As part of the Holo Surgical acquisition, we acquired intellectual property and technologies that relate to digital surgery. As of December 31, 2020, the intellectual property of the Holo Surgical business included, among other things, one issued U.S. patent, one granted European patent, eleven U.S. pending patent applications, and ten pending European patent applications. We do not know whether our current patent applications, or any future patent applications that we may file, will result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, or at all, or whether any patents we may receive will be challenged or invalidated. The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. The expected years of expiration for these patents and any patents that issue from such pending applications range from 2037 to 2040. The ARAI platform is an autonomous anatomical mapping technology designed to assist surgeons and physicians to diagnose, treat, and manage patients with neurosurgical and orthopedic conditions. The ARAI platform is capable of advanced, real-time analytics, autonomous presurgical planning, and autonomous intraoperative guidance, potentially enhancing surgical performance with the goal of facilitating improved patient outcomes.
 The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. As the number of entrants into our market increases, the risk of an infringement claim against us, as well 
 7


as the risk of a third party infringing on our patents, grows. While we attempt to ensure that our implants and methods do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary rights, our competitors or other third parties may assert that our implants, and the methods we employ, are covered by patents held by them. In addition, our competitors and other third parties may assert that future implants and methods we may employ infringe their patents. If third parties claim that we infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected implant. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We are currently and have in the past been, and may in the future be, involved in litigation relating to intellectual property. For more information regarding the risks related to intellectual property, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

 We currently market and sell our products in the United States and in more than 40 countries globally. Our U.S. Commercial organization includes Professional Education, Corporate Accounts, and field-based Area Sales Directors and Regional Product Specialists supported by an extensive network of independent spine and biomaterial distributors. Our international sales organization consists of a direct sales force in several European countries and stocking distributors in the rest of the world. 
 We anticipate adding additional independent distributors and plan to invest in additional marketing and surgeon education & training to support this expansion. We believe the expansion of our U.S. and international sales efforts will provide us with significant opportunity for future growth as we launch our digital technology platform, expand our product portfolio, and seek to penetrate existing and new markets.
 Surgeon Education and Training 
 We devote significant resources to educate surgeons on the proper use of our technologies and techniques. The successful use of our products and technologies depends, in part, on the training and skills of the surgeon performing the procedure. We are developing a state-of-the-art cadaver operating theater and training facility in our San Diego Innovation Center, to help drive adoption of our products. 
 We believe our success has been, and will continue to be, partially dependent on our ability to differentiate, with clinically validated products and procedures, the quality of our products and reputation within the spine surgeon community. We have a strong commitment to conducting collaborative research with surgeons and we intend to continue working with surgeons and other healthcare professionals in clinical research to further advance our pipeline of novel, innovative technology, and product offerings.
 International Operation 
 Internationally, we market and distribute our implants through a direct distribution organization and a network of independent distributors. International revenues accounted for approximately 16% of our 2020 global revenues. 
 Our international business is based in Wurmlingen, Germany. With our presence in the region, we can rely on the large local network of spine manufacturers and the wider “Medical Valley Community” of spine and medical device experts and talent. Our international warehousing and logistics have been outsourced to a qualified third-party logistics provider based in the Netherlands that has scalable biomaterials and hardware capabilities and operations. We received MDR certification in the EU in October 2020, which will provide us opportunities for future expansion. 
 A significant addition to our international presence is the acquisition of Holo Surgical in Poland which will allow us to harness new capabilities in digital surgery with artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. 
 
Competition
 Competition in the medical implant industry is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. Companies within the industry based on compete design of related instrumentation, efficacy of implants, service and relationships with the surgical community, depth of range of implants, scientific and clinical results and pricing.  Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, with much greater resources. In some cases, our customers compete with us in multiple product categories.
 We consider our principal competitors in the spine implant and biomaterials markets to include Medtronic, Zimmer, plc. DePuy Synthes NuVasive, Inc., Stryker Corporation, Global Medical, Inc., Alphatec Holdings Inc., SeaSpine Holdings Corporation, and Orthofix Medical Inc.

Government Regulation and Corporate Compliance
 Government Regulation
 Government regulation plays a significant role in the design and distribution of allograft tissue implants and medical devices. We procure, where applicable, process/manufacture, and market our allograft tissue implants and medical devices worldwide. Although some standardization exists, each country in which we do business has its own specific regulatory requirements. These requirements are dynamic in nature and, as such, are continually changing. New regulations may be promulgated at any time and with limited notice. While we believe that we are in material compliance with all existing pertinent international and domestic laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in governmental administrations and regulations, or their interpretation or application, will not adversely affect our operations. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, inability to market current products, criminal prosecution, and/or refusal of the government to authorize the marketing of new products.
 We currently market and distribute allograft implants that are processed from human tissue, which are processed by third-party suppliers who are responsible for satisfying local regulatory requirements and who ship the implants directly to our customers. We believe that worldwide regulation of allografts is likely to intensify as the international regulatory community focuses on the growing demand for these implants and the attendant safety and efficacy issues of citizen recipients. 
 Our research, development, and clinical programs, as well as our marketing and commercial operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our implants distributed in the United States are subject to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The regulations that cover our implants and facilities vary widely based on implant type and classification both in the United States, and from country to country. The amount of time required to obtain approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities also differs from country to country. 
 Unless an exemption applies, most of the medical devices that we commercially distribute in the United States are covered by premarket notification (“510(k)”) clearance from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II. Manufacturers of most Class II medical devices are required to obtain 510(k) clearance prior to marketing their devices. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in technological and performance characteristics to another legally marketed 510(k)-cleared “predicate device.” By regulation, the FDA’s performance goals are to clear or deny a 510(k) premarket notification within 90 FDA review days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance may take longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a lengthy premarket approval application (“PMA”) process. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval through the PMA process. 
 Class III medical devices are required to undergo the PMA approval process in which the manufacturer must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will typically conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations (21 CFR Part 820) (“QSR”). FDA reviews of PMA applications generally can take between one and three years, or longer. We have one FDA PMA approved device: The Coflex Interlaminar Stabilization device. Coflex is currently the only FDA PMA-approved implant for the treatment of moderate to severe lumbar spinal stenosis in conjunction with decompression. 
 The medical devices that we develop, manufacture, distribute, and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals to develop and market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. While we believe that we have obtained, or will be able to obtain, all necessary clearances and approvals for the manufacture and sale of our implants and that they are, or will be, in material compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue such compliance. After an implant is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements may include, as applicable: product listing and establishment registration; QSRs, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; labeling regulations (including unique device identification (“UDI”) requirements), and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses or indications; clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major 
 9


change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and notices of corrections or removals. 
 We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with FDA’s QSR and other regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public Warning Letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities outside the United States have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The EU has nationally transposed regulations based on the European Commission (“EC”) Medical Device Directives (“MDD”) for the control of medical devices with which manufacturers must comply. New Medical Device Regulations (“MDR”) were slated to replace the medical device directives effective May 26, 2020 in the EU. As of April 23, 2020, implementation of the EU MDR has been delayed until May 26, 2021. Manufacturers must have received Conformitè Europèene (“CE”) certification from a “notified body” to be able to sell products within the member states of the EU. Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a CE mark. Products covered by the EC directives that do not bear the CE mark cannot be sold or distributed within the EU. All products that we distribute in the EU have received CE certification. 
 All medical devices currently distributed in the EU under MDD are likely impacted by the upcoming implementation of MDR. MDR may also include products, such as human tissue, not traditionally considered medical devices in the EU. Additionally, MDR, among other things, increases regulatory requirements for several medical device groupings applicable to our implants distributed in the EU, including strengthening notified body oversight for Class I reusable surgical instruments, and up-classifying spinal devices in contact with the spinal column. We received MDR certification in October 2020. 
 Our products may be reimbursed by third-party payers, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Third-party payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policy holder’s healthcare insurance benefits are limited. Also, third-party payers may challenge the medical necessity and prices paid for our products and services. 
 The False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, as well as state and international anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation, regulate the conduct of medical device companies’ interactions with the healthcare industry. Among other things, these laws and others generally: (1) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, (including Medicare and Medicaid); (2) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; and (3) prohibit inappropriate payment to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We maintain a compliance program that incorporates the seven fundamental elements as set forth by the Office of the Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This facilitates our compliance with requirements regarding the prohibition of inappropriate transfers of value in exchange for referrals or obtaining or retaining foreign business engagements, prohibition regarding the submission of inappropriate claims for reimbursement to federal healthcare programs, as well as generally ensuring ethical interactions with the healthcare industry both domestically and internationally. 
 Under Section 6002 of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act) and similar state and international transparency reporting legislation, we are required to collect and report data regarding payments or other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and other persons in the healthcare industry. Our compliance program ensures all such payments and transfers of value are appropriate per the requirements of applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption legislation and that all required data is reported to relevant U.S. and International governmental entities as called for by applicable transparency reporting legislation. 
 In addition, U.S. federal, state, and international laws protect the confidentiality of certain health and other personal information, in particular individually identifiable information such as medical records and other protected health information (“PHI”), and restrict the use and disclosure of such information. In administering our employee health plan, we comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). In our dealing with customers such as health care providers 
 10


or hospitals, we are not a Covered Entity or Business Associate as defined by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but we voluntarily incorporate applicable HIPAA standards in our corporate policies regarding handling of PHI we receive. We are also subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act. At the international level, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (“GDPR”) applies to our processing of personal data of EU residents. This law regulates and protects the collection, use, processing, and disclosure of personal information, including by imposing privacy and security requirements and penalties for violations. We comply with this regulation for both general personal data as well as the higher sensitivity standards for health and financial data and are implementing the standards of this regulation as part of our corporate policy for processing personal data from all U.S. and international jurisdictions.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 197 employees of which 81 were employed outside of the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. We believe a strong employee culture and a commitment to improving patient lives by advancing the standard of spine care will help foster a shared sense of engagement and purpose among our employees and provide us with a competitive advantage. Our culture and employees are driven by our five values: being relentless, gritty and tenacious; acting with speed; being customer-focused and patient-minded; leading with integrity; and being bold and acting courageously. We intend to attract and retain the best talent in the industry by offering competitive pay, annual incentive awards, equity opportunities, health, wellness and retirement benefits, and a work environment that enables our employees to fully utilize their potential and deliver long-term stockholder value. We also believe having a diverse workforce, including diversity of personal characteristics and experience, is important for us to succeed as we transform our legacy business into Surgalign: a leading stand-alone spinal implant company. 
Seasonality
 Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopedic implant surgeries and elective procedures generally declines during the summer months and our increases in the fourth quarter.
