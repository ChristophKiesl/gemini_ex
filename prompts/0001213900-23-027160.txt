See Note 1, Description of the Business to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.



Platform



Brand



The FaZe brand began as a gaming-specific brand, but as the business and industry have evolved, we have transformed into what we believe to be one of the most well-known youth culture and lifestyle brands. We believe that the FaZe brand is among the most recognized and engaged brands across both Esports and traditional sports. The strength of our brand is instrumental in driving audience growth, attracting new talent, brand sponsors and collaborators to the FaZe platform and supporting business expansion into new markets.



We have differentiated our brand through our long tenure in the industry, the authenticity of our brand and community, and our reach beyond gaming. We were an early mover in online video game and youth culture, which we believe gives us a longer track record in the industry than many of our peers and a leading role in shaping the industry as it exists today. Our pioneering role in the video game content industry has allowed us to expand our focus to broader youth culture as the games industry grew and became a core part of youth and online culture. Our long history of success in the industry and investment in building a long term sustainable platform has established our credibility to interact with our audience with authenticity.



Talent Network



FaZe has established a diverse and culturally relevant talent roster of over 118 core personalities across content creation, Esports and celebrity affiliates as of December 31, 2022. Our founding members, Thomas Oliveira (“FaZe Temperrr”), Richard Bengtson II (“FaZe Banks”), Nordan Shat (“FaZe Rain”), Sabastian Diamond (“FaZe Cbass”) and Yousef Abdelfattah (“FaZe Apex”) are recognized as pioneers and trend setters in the industry and remain active members of FaZe. As we have grown our talent roster, we have made sure to not rely on any single individual to carry the brand, but rather have worked to develop a broad talent base, where each person is able to establish and grow their own personal brand and following within the overall FaZe platform. We work with our talent to create new content and connect with new audiences, leading to growth in our overall reach. Each member of our roster serves as an important piece in the puzzle of FaZe’s big picture content platform and most of our fans engage with multiple members of our talent roster.



Our content creators are individuals that create gaming and lifestyle-related content for people to watch on platforms such as YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. The content we create is generally unscripted and includes game and non-game based content, livestreams and vlogs. Our content creators maintain a high level of engagement with their audiences through the comments and chat function of the video platforms and by maintaining an active social media presence. Many of our content creators livestream content over 300+ days a year. With their continual creation of content and daily interactions with fans, our content creators are one of the strongest touchpoints between the FaZe brand and our audience.



Our talent agreements generally follow a standard form that provides: (i) for an initial term of two years, subject to month-to-month automatic renewal thereafter; (ii) that FaZe shall be the sole and exclusive manager of the talent, providing facilities and certain mutually agreed upon resources such as sales personnel, opportunities to create and share content on FaZe channels and platforms and advice on promotional and business relations and practices; and (iii) that the talent shall post to social media, participate in FaZe social media interactions, engage in productions with FaZe, generally support FaZe and its projects and split revenue generated by such activities with FaZe. For the year ended December 31, 2022, one content creator accounted for approximately 18% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the same content creator accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenue, of which approximately 8% represented a one-time payment to FaZe for the sale to a third party of a five-year exclusive license with respect to certain historical content posted to YouTube by the content creator prior to March 2021. This content creator or other FaZe talent may generate significant revenue in the future as a result of similar one-time sales of licenses to third parties with respect to certain content or as a result of participation in other one-time or limited events.

As of December 31, 2022, we have over 47 Esports/gaming professionals who are members of one of our ten professional Esports teams that compete regionally and globally for Esports championships and prize pools. Our Esports and gaming professionals compete globally in Apex Legends, Counter Strike Global Offensive, Call of Duty, Fortnite, PUBG, PUBG Mobile, Halo, FIFA, FIFA Online 4, Rainbow Six Siege, Super Smash Bros, Valorant, and Rocket League. Generally, our Esports professionals focus on professional competitions rather than content creation. However, a few of our Esports professionals are also content creators, such as Mongraal, who has over 16 million fans across Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Twitch Our integrated platform allows us to offer our Esports professionals the opportunity to become content creators once their professional playing career is over, which we believe not many of our competitors have the infrastructure to facilitate. Our ability to transition Esports professionals to content creation helps FaZe retain talent and the audience we have built up, provides continuity on the platform and also elongates the lifespan of a professional gamer, offering new ways to bring in revenue for themselves as well as the Company.



As FaZe has grown as an organization and attained broader mainstream appeal in recent years, celebrities, athletes, and musicians who are also passionate gamers expressed interest in joining the FaZe community and partnering with us. We saw an opportunity to expand our talent roster to include these people that loved gaming and wanted to be a part of FaZe Clan. To date, we have partnered with celebrity collaborators including musical artists Lil Yachty and Offset (from Migos), NFL star Kyler Murray and basketball prospect LeBron James Jr. These celebrities play games and interact with content creators and take part in creating lifestyle and games content videos. We believe that FaZe’s affiliation with these celebrities is mutually beneficial, as the celebrities receive exposure to a broad, young audience and a platform for monetizing their interest in games and youth culture. Meanwhile, we are able to further elevate the FaZe brand and expand our audience by accessing the celebrities’ fanbases. These relationships have further legitimized our position as a brand which consumers look to for lifestyle advice and new trends, as well as a place where our audience can interact with some of the world’s best athletes. All the celebrity talent with whom we have collaborated originated as fans of the brand before they collaborated with FaZe. As celebrity talent helps grow our brand awareness, we believe these collaborations will support a natural talent acquisition pipeline and improve our overall relationship retention.



Audience



We have cultivated a strong and engaged fanbase by engaging with our audience across the most popular digital platforms. As of December 31, 2022, we had a Total Reach of approximately 528 million fans across Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Twitch and 136 million Aggregate YouTube Subscribers, representing a 17% growth of Aggregate YouTube Subscribers compared to December 31, 2021. Many of our fans have been following the brand since its inception over ten years ago, and they look to FaZe as a curator of culture. Our target audience are members of the Millennial and Generation Z generations globally, and according to our analysis of YouTube data, 81% of our audience is between the ages of 13-34 years old. The younger generations that make up our core audience will continue to grow in terms of spending power and importance to the global economy. Our core audience came of age in a highly-connected, digital world and have consumption preferences that we believe make them difficult to reach for established, large-scale brands and traditional media platforms. For additional information on the terms Total Reach and Aggregate YouTube Subscribers, as well as our other key performance indicators, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Indicators.” Our typical audience member engages with FaZe across three different platforms. We track impressions across social media platforms, which represents the number of times a piece of content is displayed on social media, no matter if it is clicked or not and engagements, as described in section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We also track certain metrics across our YouTube and Twitch platforms, including views and subscriptions. In 2022, we reached 1.2 billion+ YouTube cumulative lifetime views and over 1.9 billion Instagram cumulative lifetime views solely on the main FaZe Instagram account. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we saw growth of approximately 2% in our cumulative YouTube views and growth of approximately 76% in our cumulative Instagram views.



We believe the FaZe platform can be a facilitator for other brands that want to reach our core consumers and, more broadly, serve as a conduit between the digital and real world.



Monetization



Brand Sponsorships



The FaZe platform provides brands and advertisers with the ability to reach and engage with our young and engaged audience base. We work with brands to provide targeted solutions that meet their needs by leveraging our breadth of sponsorship inventory that includes sponsorship of FaZe Esports teams, branded content featuring popular FaZe content creators, livestreaming within a gaming destination where millions tune in to watch their favorite streamers, social activation across our footprint of approximately 528 million Total Reach on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Twitch, and media amplification to provide increased reach to brands own content. We believe that, as the reach of the FaZe brand expands, our value proposition to advertisers will also continue to improve. We continue to explore new solutions for brands and advertisers to capitalize on significant demand to access both being associated with the FaZe platform and our audience.



The primary brand sponsorship products that we offer to advertisers are brand deals and talent deals. Brand deals comprise the largest portion of our Brand Sponsorship business and typically present strong unit economics for us. Brand deals are made through the FaZe sales team and provide the brand with category exclusivity across the FaZe platform, including the full roster of FaZe talent. Brand deals account for the largest individual deals we enter into and are generally with larger, blue chip sponsors and are at least one year in duration. Talent deals are typically smaller in size than brand deals and are made directly with individual FaZe talent to promote a brand or product within content created by the selected talent. For example, FaZe Rug had a smaller scale deal with G Fuel LLC in addition to FaZe’s broader brand deal that expired in February 2022. Talent deals are often from niche sponsors and on a month-to-month basis.

As we have grown our audience and recognition of the FaZe platform, we have broadened our sponsorship portfolio from primarily sponsors endemic to gaming to mass-market sponsors across the food and beverage, auto, and technology industries, including, most recently, well-known sponsors DraftKings, McDonalds, Ghost Energy and DoorDash. In July 2022, we launched a virtual dining experience, FaZe Subs, exclusively available on DoorDash, featuring FaZe Clan inspired sandwiches, sauces, sides and desserts available to order on DoorDash. We have also recently expanded our sponsorship portfolio to include sponsors in new industries, including MoonPay, a global crypto payments infrastructure provider. We have consistently expanded our sponsor base with limited turnover, growing to nine Significant Sponsors as defined in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Increased segmentation and specialization within markets has expanded our available advertising and sponsorship inventory by increasing the number of different categories, providing additional opportunities for brands to associate with the FaZe brand, while also enabling us to increase the density of the FaZe sponsorship footprint. Going forward, we do not expect any individual sponsorship agreement to generate 10% or more of our total revenue.



Content



Currently, FaZe’s content is most prevalent across social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook, where we produce mostly short-form digital content. We release our content at the brand level through our owned pages and channels and oversee the content our talent releases on their own accounts to form a broad and diverse content network. Our content network primarily generates revenue through digital advertising, but also indirectly benefits our other businesses by growing our brand awareness and our audience. We utilize search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! to direct a significant amount of traffic to the social media platforms we use.



We are transforming our content production business by leveraging our talent and audience to grow, reach new platforms and create content across genres. In 2021, we expanded our content capabilities to include music, podcasts, documentaries, films and series and plan to continue expanding across formats and genres. With our expansion into new formats and creation of new distributor relationships, FaZe has the opportunity to improve unit economics and monetization. As we prepare for the next phase of our content growth, we are highly focused on owning and operating our intellectual property, creating a diversified content library and diversifying into different content verticals across a wide array of platforms.



In January 2022, we announced a new series, “FaZe 1: Powered by Moonpay,” which had 20 finalists livestreamed on Twitch 24 hours a day for 15 days in a reality show-based setting as they compete for a spot on the FaZe roster and a cross-promotional signing bonus. The winner was announced on May 26, 2022.



We currently generate a portion of our revenue from our produced content primarily in the form of advertising on other platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. We also receive a share of the digital advertising money generated by our owned channels and our content creators’ channels on third-party platforms. In addition, we have generated revenue by licensing FaZe content to third parties. For example, on October 1, 2022, FaZe entered into a Content License Agreement (the “Content License Agreement”) with Tailfin Fund I, LLC (the “Licensee”), pursuant to which FaZe received a one-time fee of $1.2 million for granting to Licensee an exclusive, non-transferrable right and license for a term of five years to collect all advertising revenues generated from views of content posted to the YouTube channel of one content creator from November 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022. Additionally, for the duration of the term and three months thereafter, FaZe granted to Licensee a right of first refusal and Licensee granted to FaZe a matching right with respect to offers to monetize, license, sell or assign any FaZe content not covered by the Content License Agreement initially. We currently expect these revenue opportunities to continue in the future. As our content business continues to evolve, we believe our monetization will expand to new avenues as well. With increasing longer-form content and access to distribution media, we believe we will have an opportunity to generate revenue from our intellectual property and created shows, live events, podcasts, and docuseries.

Consumer Products



We leverage our brand, talent and audience to drive consumer product sales across a variety of categories and distribution channels. We design and sell merchandise, apparel and consumer products, and have strong direct-to-consumer relationships through our website, www.fazeclan.com, where we predominantly make our sales and fans can easily select and purchase their favorite products.



We currently sell consumer products across FaZe-branded, player lines, and collaboration categories. FaZe-branded products are goods or apparel displaying the FaZe logo. FaZe-branded products are developed in response to our Esports success, content offerings, and expansion of the FaZe brand in order to meet demand from our expanding audience. These products are similar to offerings from other professional sports teams and are available through our digital storefront on our website to give fans consistent access to FaZe products. Player lines feature specific brands of certain FaZe talent members. Player lines have expanded as we develop and sign additional talent and carry talent-specific branding, such as “Nuke Squad,” a group of our content creators who frequently collaborate together.



Collaborations are created through partnerships with lifestyle and culture brands. We have a strong history of collaborations that have expanded the reach and staying power of the FaZe brand. Our collaborations are typically partnerships or co-branding releases with other well-known brands that drop or release for a limited amount of time and with scarce quantity to create high levels of excitement and exclusivity. Our collaboration strategy has proven effective, as it has exposed us to new audiences and reinforced our status as a premier lifestyle brand, with consumer product drops often selling out in a matter of minutes or hours. Our collaborations and drops are selected with extreme care to ensure the strength of the FaZe brand and provide products that excite our audience.



FaZe’s first collaboration was with Champion in 2018, which provided cross-audience exposure to both brands. In 2019, we expanded our collaboration ambitions across additional premium culture brands and teamed up with Clot, Kappa, and Lyrical Lemonade on consumer product drops. In 2020, we expanded our reach across top culture brands with collaborations with rapper Juice WRLD, Be@rbrick and Anti Social Social Club and across mainstream sports with Manchester City and the NFL. Our collaborations in 2020 produced several highlights including our Be@rbrick product selling out in less than a minute, Sports Illustrated generating 131 million media impressions to date and Juice WRLD selling $1.7 million+ of merchandise in 24 hours as our most successful collaboration to date. This momentum carried forward into 2021, evidenced by our collaboration with Takashi Murakami, which sold $1.2 million+ of merchandise in less than 4 hours and crashed our licensing and manufacturing vendor NTWRK’s app. In September 2021, our collaboration with DC Comics for a FaZe Batman issue was announced, further enhancing the cross-platform and genre appeal of FaZe’s talent and content. In May 2022, we announced collaborations to date, including a line of apparel featuring a reimagined, digitized version of Mickey Mouse, “Mickey On The Grid,” designed in partnership with Disney, and a merchandise collaboration with Naruto Shippuden, a well-known anime series, selling $0.2 million and $0.7 million respectively. Our carefully crafted consumer products strategy has allowed us to engage with our fans and grow the FaZe brand through limited drops that maintain excitement for our goods. One area that we are considering, which has the potential to considerably increase the reach of our consumer products business, is entering into retail, where we could distribute a selection of products through traditional physical retail outlets. In addition, we have the opportunity to expand the types of consumer products we sell, branching into areas such as computer peripherals, which offer natural crossover with our audience’s demand and strong unit economics.



It is imperative that we expand our market share and take steps to maintain our premium brand position. To accomplish this, we are exploring bifurcated product lines across scaled production and premium items. We envision that mass-produced items would be widely available and improve our brand awareness, while premium items would have limited stock and maintain our status as an exclusive brand. We believe this would allow us to maintain exclusive and limited distribution of key items and continue to bolster the FaZe brand through select collaborations.

Esports and Gaming



FaZe has competed professionally in Esports for over ten years, and we continue to develop and recruit premiere talent to drive strong tournament results and our overall engagement. Our elite Esports teams compete at the highest level across ten popular video game titles and have won 36 championships as of December 31, 2022.



In addition to the revenue it generates, our Esports and Gaming business serves as an important tool to continue to build and reinforce the FaZe brand, particularly in international markets where Esports are widely followed. The success of our thirteen teams across Apex Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, EA SPORTS FIFA 23, FIFA Online 4, Fortnite, Halo Infinite, PUBG: Battlegrounds, PUBG mobile, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Valorant, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, draws new fans into the FaZe ecosystem and serves as a means of cost-effective marketing for the FaZe brand. Single events in the space can create broad ripple effects, such as the 2022 CSGO Tournament PGL Antwerp, which generated 25 million impressions and 0.7 million engagements for FaZe across all of our social media networks and channels.



Our Esports and Gaming business generates revenue across several verticals including prize money, digital items, league participation and transfers. Due to strong team success, tournament winnings currently makes up the largest portion of Esports/Gaming revenue. League participation revenue is generated as revenue share from closed leagues that FaZe participates in. Transfers represent one-off revenue payments when transferring a player to a peer organization and are dependent on player performance and roster construction.



We constantly evaluate opportunities to expand our Esports and Gaming platform through producing content by playing new games and sharing content in new geographies. When selecting new games, we consider game popularity, ability to compete with similar titles of the same genre, league structure, game publisher, profitability and revenue potential, among other things. We prefer mainstream games with global audiences to maximize the exposure our brand gains from fielding a team. Games with strong international audiences provide us with a chance to tap into new markets and expand our global presence. We prioritize winning first and foremost in order to maintain our status as a premiere Esports organization, and we will only enter a league if we believe we are able to put together and maintain a consistently competitive roster. We have generally preferred open leagues instead of closed leagues in order to minimize upfront capital required and risk, but we evaluate closed leagues with particularly attractive characteristics across other aspects, such as competition in extremely popular games. The credibility of game publishers is also important, as we need to trust them to maintain and grow the game and Esports ecosystem. When evaluating the profitability and revenue potential of a game, we focus on the availability of branded digital items, potential for expansion of under-monetized media rights, and competitive prize money opportunity primarily with consideration for additional upsides such as franchise value appreciation.



Competition



We compete against a vast variety of fragmented firms across multiple industries, including well-established lifestyle brands, long-standing players in the media industry, traditional sports leagues, and new entrants challenging our position in the Esports and gaming industry. We face significant competition from both online and offline competitors primarily on brand awareness, content quality and breadth, and the speed at which we can continue to keep pace with the evolving preferences of our target consumers. While we believe that we compete favorably across these factors taken as a whole, new competitors will likely continue to emerge, and these competitors may have greater financial resources or brand awareness than we do.
Intellectual Property



The recognition of the FaZe brand is an important component to our success. We have obtained a set of intellectual property registrations and applications, including for the FaZe brand, throughout the world.





5







We police our trademark portfolio globally, including by monitoring trademark registries around the world and investigating digital, online and common law uses in order to learn as soon as possible whether the relevant parties engage in or plan to engage in conduct that would violate our valuable trademark rights. We monitor registries through the use of robust international subscription watch services, supplemented by periodic manual review.



We typically discover or are informed of infringing uses of our trademarks through our internal policing system or by our employees.



We investigate and evaluate each instance of infringement to determine the appropriate course of action, including cease and desist letters, administrative proceedings, cybersquatting actions or infringement actions, if any. Wherever possible, we seek to resolve these matters amicably and without litigation.



In an effort to ensure that registries in countries where we operate or intend to operate remain clear of infringing trademark registrations, we frequently file opposition actions, cancellation actions and other administrative proceedings around the world.



Human Capital Resources




As of December 31, 2022, we had 112 total employees, including 108 full-time employees, as well as 98 independent contractors



As part of our plans to become a more cost-efficient company, on February 16, 2023, we announced a reduction in by approximately 20%, which, included streamlining our team structure in support of our business priorities. Following these reductions, we had 90 employees and 48 independent contractors, as of March 10, 2023.
Regulatory Matters



The digital content and entertainment industry and the markets in which we operate are new and developing and, as such, are not heavily regulated at this time. There are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with operating in new and developing industries and markets, especially as the laws and regulations regarding these industries and markets are also developing and changing. Although we are not currently subject to significant government regulation, the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us in the future are uncertain and may be conflicting in different jurisdictions in which we operate; as a result, we may come under increased regulatory scrutiny which may restrict the digital content and entertainment industry and associated markets, including with respect to talent management, rights of publicity, intellectual property, consumer protection electronic commerce, advertising, targeted, electronic or telephonic marketing, competition, data protection and privacy, data localization, anti-corruption and bribery, content regulation, taxation, labor and employment, securities regulation, financial reporting and accounting and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistent with our current policies and practices and in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations may be uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industries in which we operate, and new laws or adverse findings of law regarding the characterization of the type of business FaZe operates could alter our legal and regulatory burden.



Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours that conduct business through the internet and mobile devices. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations may be high and are likely to increase in the future, particularly as the degree of regulation increases, our business grows and our geographic scope expands. Further, the impact of these laws and regulations may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to our peers in the technology sector that have greater resources. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities or penalties, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.





6







Although we are not heavily regulated at this time, we rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses relevant to the content we produce and make available on various third-party platforms, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), the Communications Decency Act (the “CDA”) and the fair-use doctrine in the U.S., and the Electronic Commerce Directive in the E.U. However, each of these laws is subject to uncertain or evolving judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. If the rules, doctrines or currently available defenses change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply protections similar to those that are currently available in the U.S. or the E.U., or if a court were to change the application of those rules to us and the third party services upon which we rely, we and such third parties could be required to expend significant resources to try to comply with the new rules or incur liability, and our business, revenue and financial results could be harmed.



Non-compliance with any applicable laws and regulations could result in penalties or significant legal liability. We take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and will continue to do so as our regulatory burden changes, but there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action, including fines, in the event of an incident. We or our third-party service providers could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our third-party service providers’ business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers’ business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, government authorities outside the U.S. may also seek to restrict or block access to our content, platform or website, or to application stores or the internet generally, or require a license therefor, and to the hosting, production or streaming of certain content or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of our content in that jurisdiction for a period of time or indefinitely. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal Proceedings and Regulatory Matters.”
