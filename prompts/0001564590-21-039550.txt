 Steel Processing
 Steel Processing consists of the Worthington Steel business unit, and our consolidated joint ventures, Samuel, Spartan, TWB, and WSP.  For fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, the percentage of our consolidated net sales generated by Steel Processing was approximately 65%, 61% and 65%, respectively.
 
Worthington Steel is one of the largest independent intermediate processors of flat-rolled steel in the United States.  It occupies a niche in the steel industry by focusing on products requiring exact specifications.  These products cannot typically be supplied as efficiently by steel mills to the end-users of these products.
 
As of May 31, 2021, Steel Processing, including Spartan, TWB, Samuel and WSP, operated 22 manufacturing facilities located in Ohio (8), Michigan (4), Tennessee (2), Alabama (1), Indiana (1), Kentucky (1), New York (1), Canada (1) and Mexico (3). As noted above, Steel Processing acquired four additional facilities in June of 2021 (one in Kentucky being operated by the Worthington Steel business unit; and two in Ohio and one in Michigan being operated by TWB).
 
Steel Processing serves approximately 760 customers in many markets including automotive, aerospace, agricultural, appliance, construction, container, hardware, heavy-truck, HVAC, lawn and garden, leisure and recreation, office furniture, and office equipment.  The automotive industry is one of the largest consumers of flat-rolled steel, and thus the largest end market for Steel Processing.  For fiscal 2021, Steel Processing’s top three customers represented approximately 30% of the operating segment’s total net sales.
 
Steel Processing buys coils of steel from integrated steel mills and mini-mills and processes them to the precise type, thickness, length, width, shape and surface quality required by customer specifications.  Computer-aided processing capabilities include, among others:
 
 
• | cold reducing, which achieves close tolerances of thickness;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | configured blanking, which mechanically stamps steel into specific shapes;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | coil fed laser blanking, which uses lasers to cut coils of steel, aluminum and other metals into specific shapes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cutting-to-length, which cuts coils into sheets of exact length;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | dry-lube, the process of coating steel with a dry, soap-based lubricant;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hot dip coating, which coats steel with either zinc, zinc alloy or aluminum and silicon through a hot dip process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hydrogen annealing, a thermal process that changes the hardness and certain metallurgical characteristics of steel;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | laser welding, which joins steel or aluminum blanks with different thicknesses, coatings or material strength;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3

 
• | pickling, a chemical process using an acidic solution to remove surface oxide which develops on hot-rolled steel;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | slitting, which cuts steel coils or steel sheets to specific widths;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | oscillate slitting, a slitting process that spools together several narrow coils welded end-to-end into one larger coil;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | temper rolling, which is the process of light cold-rolling steel;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | tension leveling, a method of applying pressure to achieve precise flatness tolerances; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | non-metallic coating, including acrylic and paint coating.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Steel Processing also toll processes steel for steel mills, large end-users, service centers and other processors.  Toll processing is different from typical steel processing in that the mill, end-user or other party retains title to the steel and has the responsibility for selling the end product.  Toll processing enhances Worthington Steel’s participation in the market for wide sheet steel and large standard orders, a market generally served by steel mills rather than by intermediate steel processors.
 The steel processing industry is fragmented and highly competitive.  There are many competitors, including other independent intermediate processors.  Competition is primarily on the basis of price, product quality and the ability to meet delivery requirements.  Technical service and support for material testing and customer-specific applications enhance the quality of products (see the Technical Services section below).  However, the extent to which technical service and support capability has improved Steel Processing’s competitive position has not been quantified.  Steel Processing’s ability to meet tight delivery schedules is, in part, based on the proximity of our facilities to customers, suppliers and one another.  The extent to which plant location has impacted Steel Processing’s competitive position has not been quantified.  Processed steel products are priced competitively, primarily based on market factors, including, among other things, market pricing, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs, and overall economic conditions in the United States and abroad.
 Pressure Cylinders
 Pressure Cylinders consists of the Worthington Cylinders business unit.  The percentage of our consolidated net sales generated by Pressure Cylinders was approximately 35%, 37% and 32% in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.  
 Pressure Cylinders manufactures and sells filled and unfilled pressure cylinders, tanks, hand torches, tools, well water and expansion tanks, along with various accessories and related products for diversified end-use market applications.  The following is a description of these markets:  
  
• | Industrial Products: This market sector includes high pressure and acetylene cylinders for industrial gases, refrigerant and certain propane gas (LPG) cylinders, alternative fuel cylinders and other specialty products. Cylinders in this market sector are generally sold to gas producers, cylinder exchangers and industrial distributors. Industrial gas cylinders hold fuel for uses such as cutting, brazing and soldering, and semiconductor production. Refrigerant gas cylinders are used to hold refrigerant gases for commercial, residential and automotive air conditioning and refrigeration systems. LPG cylinders hold fuel for barbeque grills, recreational vehicle equipment, residential and light commercial heating systems, industrial forklifts and commercial/residential cooking (the latter, generally outside North America). Alternative fuel cylinders include composite and steel cylinders used to hold CNG and hydrogen for automobiles, buses, and light-duty trucks. Specialty products include a variety of fire suppression, life support and chemical tanks. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Consumer Products: This market sector includes propane-filled cylinders for torches, camping stoves and other applications, hand-held torches, Balloon Time® helium-filled balloon kits, well water tanks and expansion tanks and specialized hand tools and instruments. These products are sold primarily to mass merchandisers, retailers and distributors. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While a large percentage of Pressure Cylinders sales are made to major accounts, this operating segment served approximately 4,400 customers during fiscal 2021.  Sales to one customer represented approximately 10% of net sales for Pressure Cylinders during fiscal 2021.  
 
As of May 31, 2021, Pressure Cylinders operated 13 manufacturing facilities located in Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio (3), Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Austria, Germany, Poland, and Portugal.  
 
For sales in the United States and Canada, high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders are primarily manufactured in accordance with United States Department of Transportation and Transport Canada specifications.  Outside the United States and Canada, cylinders are manufactured according to European norm specifications, as well as various other international standards.  Other products are produced to applicable industry standards including, as applicable, those standards issued by the American Petroleum Institute, ASME and UL.
 
Worthington Cylinders has one principal domestic competitor in the low-pressure LPG cylinder market, and there are a number of foreign competitors in the LPG cylinder market and in the non-refillable refrigerant market.  We believe that Worthington Cylinders has the largest market share in its domestic low-pressure cylinder markets.  In the other cylinder markets, there are several competitors.  Worthington Cylinders is a leading supplier to the European markets for both the high-pressure cylinders and the low-pressure non-refillable cylinders.  Worthington Cylinders generally has a strong competitive position for its industrial, energy, retail and specialty products, but competition varies on a product-by-product basis.  As with our other operating segment, competition is based upon price, service and quality.
 
Pressure Cylinders uses the trade names “Worthington Cylinders”, “AMTROL”, “Alfa”, “General”, “Garden Weasel”, and “PacTool” to conduct business.
 The Company uses the registered trademark “Balloon Time®” to market helium-filled balloon kits; the registered trademark “BERNZOMATIC®” to market certain fuel cylinders and hand-held-torches; the trademark “WORTHINGTON PRO-GRADE” to market certain LPG cylinders, hand torches and camping fuel cylinders; the registered trademark “Coleman®” to market certain camping fuel cylinders; the registered trademarks “MAP-PRO®” and “Pro-Max®” to market certain hand torch cylinders; the registered trademark “Mag-Torch®” to market certain hand-held torches; the registered trademarks General®, Garden-Weasel® and Pactool International® to market certain tools; the registered trademarks “Therm-X-Trol®” and “Extrol®” to market thermal expansion tanks; the registered trademarks “Well X Trol®”, “Champion®”, and “Wel-Flo and Design®” to market well tanks; and the registered trademarks “Hydromax®” and “Boilermate®” to market indirect fired water heaters.
 Each registered trademark has an original duration of 10 to 20 years, depending on the date it was registered and the country in which it is registered, and is subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period upon continued use and appropriate application.  The Company intends to continue using the trade names and trademarks described above and to timely renew each of its registered trademarks that remains in use.
 Other
 The Other category includes the results of the Company’s former Engineered Cabs operating segment, on a historical basis through November 1, 2019, when the Company contributed substantially all of the related net assets to a then newly-formed joint venture, Taxi Workhorse Holdings, LLC (the “Cabs joint venture”) in which the Company owns a 20% non-controlling interest.  The deconsolidated net assets included the two primary manufacturing facilities of the Engineered Cabs business located in Greeneville, Tennessee and Watertown, South Dakota.  The remaining non-core assets of the Engineered Cabs business, including the fabricated products facility in Stow, Ohio, and the steel packaging facility in Greensburg, Indiana, were retained and have since been exited.

Segment Financial Data
 Financial information for the reportable business segments is provided in “Note P – Segment Data”.  
 Suppliers 
 The primary raw material purchased by Worthington is steel.  We purchase steel in large quantities at regular intervals from major primary producers of steel, both domestic and foreign. The amount purchased from any particular supplier varies from year to year depending on a number of factors including market conditions, then current relationships and prices and terms offered.  In nearly all market conditions, steel is available from a number of suppliers and generally any supplier relationship or contract can and has been replaced with little or no significant interruption to our business.  During fiscal 2021, we purchased approximately 2.45 million tons of steel (74.0% hot-rolled, 14.3% cold-rolled and 11.7% galvanized) on a consolidated basis.  
 Steel is primarily purchased and processed based on specific customer orders for Steel Processing, while Pressure Cylinders purchases steel to meet production schedules.  For certain raw materials, there are more limited suppliers -- for example, helium and zinc, which are generally purchased at market prices.  Since there are a limited number of suppliers in the helium and zinc markets, if delivery from a major supplier is disrupted due to a force majeure type occurrence, it may be difficult to obtain an alternative supply.  Raw materials are generally purchased in the open market on a negotiated spot-market basis at prevailing market prices.  Supply contracts are also entered into, some of which have fixed pricing and some of which are indexed (monthly or quarterly).  During fiscal 2021, we purchased steel from the following major suppliers, in alphabetical order: Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; NLMK USA; North Star BlueScope Steel, LLC; Nucor Corporation; Steel Dynamics, Inc.; and United States Steel Corporation (“U.S. Steel”).  Major suppliers of aluminum to Pressure Cylinders in fiscal 2021 were, in alphabetical order:  Arconic Inc.; DK Resources Limited; Geumsan Tech; Horizon; Meyer Aluminum; Norsk Hydro; Novelis Corporation; and Shanghai Everskill.  Major suppliers of zinc to Steel Processing in fiscal 2021 were, in alphabetical order: Considar Metal Marketing Inc. (a/k/a HudBay); Glencore Ltd.; Teck Resources Limited; and Trafigura Trading LLC.  Approximately 44.13 million pounds of zinc and 3.37 million pounds of aluminum were purchased in fiscal 2021.  We believe our supplier relationships are favorable. 
Technical Services 
 We employ a staff of engineers and other technical personnel, and we maintain fully-equipped laboratories to support operations.  These facilities enable verification, analysis and documentation of the physical, chemical, metallurgical and mechanical properties of raw materials and products.  Technical Service personnel also work in conjunction with the sales force to specify components and materials required to fulfill customer needs. Laboratory facilities also perform metallurgical and chemical testing as dictated by International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ASTM International, and other customer and industry specific requirements.  
Seasonality and Backlog
 Demand for most of our products remained strong throughout fiscal 2021, but sales are generally strongest in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as our operating segments are generally operating at seasonal peaks.  Historically, sales have generally been weaker in the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to reduced activity in the building and construction industry as a result of inclement weather, as well as customer plant shutdowns, particularly in the automotive industry, due to holidays.  We do not believe backlog is a significant indicator of our business.
Employees
 As of May 31, 2021, we had approximately 9,000 employees, including those employed by our unconsolidated joint ventures.  Approximately 8% of our consolidated labor force is represented by collective bargaining units.  Worthington believes it has good relationships with its employees, including those covered by collective bargaining units.
Joint Ventures
 As part of our strategy to selectively develop new products, markets and technological capabilities and to expand our international presence, while mitigating the risks and costs associated with those activities, as of May 31, 2021, we participated in four consolidated and five unconsolidated joint ventures.

 Government Regulations
 Our manufacturing facilities, generally in common with those of similar industries making similar products, are subject to many federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of our employees and the environment.  We examine ways to improve safety, reduce emissions and waste, and to decrease costs related to compliance with environmental and other government regulations.  The cost of compliance or capital expenditures for environmental control facilities necessary to meet regulatory requirements are not anticipated to be material when compared with overall costs and capital expenditures and, accordingly, are not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, or on the competitive position of Worthington or any particular business segment.
Human Capital Management
 Culture
 
In line with our people-first Philosophy, our employees have always been, and will always be, our most important asset. Worthington operates under a set of core values that are rooted in our long-standing Philosophy, which emphasizes the Golden Rule.  These core values guide us as a company, including in our approach to human capital management. As such, we are continually focused on creating and maintaining a strong Company culture. Our culture provides employees with opportunities for personal and professional development, as well as community engagement, all of which we believe contribute to the Company’s overall success. We have repeatedly been recognized as a top place to work and we offer our employees competitive pay and above-market benefits, as compared to others in our industry, all while focusing on safety, wellness, and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture.
Employee Base
 
As of May 31, 2021, we had approximately 9,000 employees, including those employed by our unconsolidated joint ventures.  Approximately 8% of our consolidated labor force is represented by collective bargaining units.  Worthington believes that our open-door policy has created an environment which fosters open communication and serves to cultivate the good relationships we have with our employees, including those covered by collective bargaining units, which is evidenced by the results of recent employee engagement surveys. For example, in the fall of 2020, 71% of employees, excluding those employed by our unconsolidated joint ventures – nearly 4,300 people worldwide – participated in our engagement survey, and the Company’s results exceeded both manufacturing and global benchmarks in a number of categories, such as Employee Engagement (74%), Safety (89%), and Manager Effectiveness (74%). 
Safety, Health and Wellness
 
We have always made the safety and well-being of our people a top priority, and we have regularly maintained an industry-leading safety record.  For us, safety is about engagement, and our employees have adopted a culture where safety is everyone’s responsibility, and not just the safety of our employees, but the safety of everyone who enters our facilities. We also provide our employees and their families with access to above-market benefits, as compared to others in our industry, including a parental leave benefit that offers all new parents the opportunity for paid time off.  Worthington has a broad array of other employee centered-benefits and programs, including a medical center, a pharmacy, chiropractic care, on-site fitness centers, free health screenings, health fairs, and other company-wide and location-specific wellness events and challenges. We believe our investments in safety, health and wellness are key to supporting and protecting our most important asset, our people.

Diversity, Inclusion and Equity
 
We believe that diversity, of all types, contributes to our success. Worthington is committed to increasing the diversity of our employee base at all levels of our organization because we believe our differences make us better and that diverse thought and experiences drive innovation and produce better results.  With our Philosophy as our foundation, we are building an environment where diversity is valued, and where all employees feel they belong and are empowered to do their best work.

To further such efforts, we have established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council (“Council”) chaired by our Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. The Council has developed a strategy where our diversity, inclusion and equity efforts are focused on strengthening four primary pillars: workforce, workplace, community and partnership. These pillars serve as a foundation for continually building and fostering an inclusive culture. We are also working to establish employee resource groups (“ERGs”) that will each have executive sponsors. These ERGs will not only be tasked with raising awareness, but will also offer mentoring and development opportunities to their members.
 
Talent Development and Retention
 
Our ability to successfully operate, grow our business and implement our business strategies is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain talented personnel at all levels of our organization. As a result, we offer our employees competitive compensation and benefits, as compared to others in our industry, which include opportunities to participate in profit sharing plans. We also strive to provide our employees with continuous opportunities to learn the skills necessary to maximize their performance, and develop new skills that allow them to maximize their potential.
