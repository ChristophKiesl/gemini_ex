BUSINESS
Overview
Zovio Inc is an education technology services company that partners with higher education institutions and employers to deliver innovative, personalized solutions to help learners and leaders achieve their aspirations. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Ashford, is a regionally accredited academic institution, which delivers programs primarily online.
In March 2005, we acquired Ashford, whose mission is to provide high-quality, accessible, affordable, and innovative educational programs that meet the diverse needs of individuals pursuing advancement in their lives, professions, and communities. We believe Ashford is helping to define the modern college experience by providing the flexibility and effectiveness of online learning. The institution offers associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree programs primarily online. Ashford is comprised of five colleges: the Forbes School of Business and Technology™, the College of Education, the College of Health, Human Services and Science, the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Doctoral Studies. As of December 31, 2019, Ashford had a total of 34,722 students enrolled.
Ashford is committed to providing a high-quality educational experience to its students, and its online delivery models, weekly start dates, commitment to affordability and transferability of credits make its programs highly attractive and accessible. Ashford's online platform has been designed to deliver a quality educational experience while offering the flexibility and convenience that many students require, particularly working adults. Ashford has a comprehensive curriculum development process and employs qualified faculty members with significant academic and practitioner credentials. Ashford conducts ongoing faculty and student assessment processes and provides a broad array of student services. We are also focused on providing innovative technologies to enhance the student experience and support faculty and student engagement.
Ashford is accredited by WASC Senior College and University Commission (“WSCUC”). For additional information regarding accreditation, see “Regulation — Accreditation” below. Ashford maintains a website at www.ashford.edu, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, or in any way a part of, this report.
On April 1, 2019, we acquired Fullstack Academy, Inc, (“Fullstack”) and on April 3, 2019, we acquired TutorMe.com, Inc. (“TutorMe”), which became our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Fullstack is an innovative web development school offering immersive technology bootcamps, whereas TutorMe is an online education platform that provides 24/7 on-demand tutoring and online courses. The operating results of Fullstack and TutorMe have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of income (loss), subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Although Fullstack and TutorMe are not yet material to our operations, both are contributors to the strategy of Zovio becoming a best-in-class education technology services company.
Enrollment
The following table summarizes period-end enrollment for Ashford as of each of the periods presented:

 | December 31, 2019 | | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | | 
Doctoral | 816 | 2.4 | % | 729 | | 1.9 | % | 841 | 2.1 | %

Bachelor's | 26,833 | 77.2 | % | 29,604 | | 77.6 | % | 32,153 | 78.9 | %
Associate's | 1,027 | 3.0 | % | 1,323 | | 3.5 | % | 1,263 | 3.1 | %
Other* | 622 | 1.8 | % | 693 | | 1.8 | % | 818 | 2.0 | %
Total | 34,722 | 100.0 | % | 38,153 | | 100.0 | % | 40,730 | 100.0 | %

* Includes students who are taking one or more courses at Ashford but have not declared that they are pursuing a specific degree.
Ashford defines period-end enrollment as the number of active students on the last day of the financial reporting period. A student is considered active if the student has attended a class within the prior 15 days or is on an institutionally-approved break not to exceed 45 days, unless the student has graduated or provided notice of withdrawal, or for new students who have completed their third week of attendance, and posted attendance in the fourth week.
As of December 31, 2019, approximately 69% of Ashford's students were female, 54% identified themselves as minorities and the average age was 35. Ashford has online students throughout the United States and students in 22 different countries.
Graduation
As of December 31, 2019, approximately 129,000 students have graduated from Ashford. The total number of credits required to obtain a degree for online programs varies based on the type of degree: an associate's degree requires a minimum of 64 credits; a bachelor's degree requires a minimum of 120 credits; a master's degree requires a minimum of 30 credits; and a doctoral degree requires a minimum of 59 credits.
Many students have previously completed some postsecondary education and have credits they would like to transfer to a new degree program. We believe students should receive credit for their prior work and Ashford works closely with its accrediting agency to obtain the right to accept transfer credits.
Tuition and Fees
The price of Ashford's courses varies based upon the number of credits per course (with most courses representing three credits), the degree level of the program and the discipline. Refer to the academic catalog for the relative price per credit for undergraduate and graduate courses.
Revenue realized from tuition is reduced by the amount of scholarships awarded to students. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded $144.5 million, $119.1 million and $103.8 million, respectively, for institutional scholarships awarded to students.
Student Financing
Students finance their education at Ashford through a combination of the various financing options:
Title IV programs
If a student attends any institution certified as Title IV eligible by the Department and meets applicable student eligibility standards, that student may receive grants, loans, or both grants and loans to help fund their education under programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act (“Title IV”). An institution participating in federal student financial aid programs authorized by Title IV (“Title IV programs”) must ensure that all program funds are accounted for and disbursed properly. To continue receiving program funds, students must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress toward the completion of their program of study.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, Ashford derived 72.4% of its cash revenues from Title IV program funds.
Federal Direct Loans
The Federal Direct Loan Program (the “Direct Loan Program”) consists of two types of loans: Stafford loans, which are either subsidized or unsubsidized, and PLUS loans, which are made available to graduate and professional students, as well as parents of dependent undergraduate students. For a Direct Subsidized Loan, the federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and during grace periods and any approved periods of deferment, until the student's obligation to repay the loan begins. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are not based on financial need and are available to students who do not qualify for a Direct Subsidized Loan, or in some cases, in addition to a Direct Subsidized Loan. Loan funds are paid to Ashford, which in turn credits the student's account for tuition and fees and disburse any requested amounts in excess of tuition and fees to the student.
Interest rates are established each year for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and PLUS loans for which the first disbursement is on or after July 1 of that year through the following June 30. The interest rate, once established, will be fixed and apply for the life of the loan. With respect to loans for which the first disbursement was on or after July 1, 2019 but before July 1, 2020, the interest rates are (i) 4.5% for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students, (ii) 6.1% for Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate/professional students and (iii) 7.1% for Direct PLUS loans.
Federal Pell Grant Program
Under the Federal Pell Grant Program, the Department makes grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. Beginning with the 2012-2013 award year, a student's eligibility to receive a Pell Grant was reduced from 18 semesters (or its equivalent) to 12 semesters (or its equivalent). The funding for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations is part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which is subject to change annually. The maximum funding amount for Pell Grant award year 2019-2020 increased to $6,195.
Non-Title IV funding sources
Other funding sources consist primarily of payments made in cash by individuals, private loans from third parties, reimbursement from corporate affiliates and government tuition assistance programs for military personnel, including veterans. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, Ashford derived 27.6% of its cash revenues from these other funding sources.
Financial aid processing
Ashford has dedicated staff that provide call center and transactional processing services for the online financial aid student populations, including services related to disbursement eligibility review and Title IV fund returns. We believe this improves student financing outcomes and enhances efforts to comply with Title IV rules and regulations.
Curricula and Scheduling
Ashford is committed to providing their students with a rigorous and rewarding academic experience that gives them the knowledge and experience necessary to be contributors, educators and leaders in their chosen professions. Ashford seeks to maintain a high level of quality in curriculum, faculty and student support services, all of which contribute to the overall student experience. The curricula are reviewed periodically to ensure that content is refined and updated as necessary. Ashford provides extensive student support services, including academic, administrative and technology support, to help maximize the success of its students. Additionally, Ashford monitors the success of the educational delivery processes through periodic faculty and student assessments. Ashford believes their commitment to quality is evident in the satisfaction and demonstrated proficiency of their students, which is measured at the completion of every course.
As of December 31, 2019, Ashford offered approximately 1,210 courses and approximately 90 degree programs through its five various colleges. Ashford's online courses are offered with weekly start dates throughout the year, except for two weeks total in late December and early January. Courses typically run five to six weeks and all courses are offered in an asynchronous format so students can complete their coursework as their schedule permits. Online students typically enroll in one course at a time. This focused approach to learning allows the student to engage fully in each course. Doctoral students are required to participate in periodic seminars and to compose and defend a dissertation on an approved topic.
Program Development
Ashford designs its academic offerings to meet the needs of a broad cross-section of prospective students. In addition to adding programs in high-demand disciplines, Ashford enhances its programs through the addition of specializations. Specialization areas are comprised of a select number of courses within an existing program that supplement that program's required courses. Specializations are used to create an offering that is tailored to the specific objectives of a student population and, therefore, is more attractive to potential students interested in a particular program. We believe the addition of specializations represents a cost-effective way to both expand our market and further enhance the differentiation of programs in that market. Ashford continues to place increased emphasis on the growth of our graduate student population through master and doctoral level programs that represent those subjects and disciplines most in demand by our student population. This is consistent with Ashford's commitment to a quality academic offering, and to pursue increased graduate student enrollments because we believe graduate students represent an attractive segment of the market.
Ashford seeks to offer programs in disciplines in which we believe there is strong demand for education and significant opportunity for employment. Ashford's current program portfolio includes offerings at the associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels in the disciplines of business, education, psychology, social sciences and health sciences. Ashford follows a defined process for identifying new degree program opportunities that incorporates student, faculty and market feedback, as well as macro trends in the relevant disciplines, in order to evaluate the expected level of demand for a new program prior to developing the content and marketing it to potential students.
Potential new programs and specializations are determined based on proposals submitted by faculty and staff and an assessment of overall market demand. Ashford's faculty and academic leadership work in collaboration with our marketing team to research and select new programs that are expected to have strong demand and that can be developed at a reasonable cost. Programs are reviewed by Ashford and must also receive approval through the normal governance process at the relevant institution. Once a program is selected for development, one or more subject matter experts are assigned to work with curriculum development staff to define measurable program-level student learning objectives. Each course in a program is designed to include learning activities that address the program objectives, foster student engagement and assess learning outcomes. All courses undergo extensive internal and external third-party quality assurance reviews before they are offered to students, and the new program is reviewed for approval through the appropriate governance processes. Following approval, an online program is conformed to the standards of our online learning management system and our marketing department creates 
a marketing plan for the program. In most cases, the time frame to identify, develop and internally approve a new program is approximately six months, not including the external regulatory approvals required before a program can be offered to students.
Comprehensive Assessment
Ashford has developed and implemented a comprehensive assessment plan focused on student learning and effective instruction. The plan stipulates assessment of learning outcomes at the course, program and institutional levels. Learning outcomes are unique to the institution and demonstrate the skills that graduates should be able to demonstrate upon completion of their respective programs. With the assistance of our dedicated assessment team, Ashford's faculty routinely evaluates and revises courses and learning resources based upon outcomes and institutional research data. Using direct and indirect measurements, student performance is assessed on an ongoing basis to help ensure student success.
We utilize Waypoint Outcomes, our proprietary assessment platform, which is an innovative, web-based assessment system of interactive rubrics, to gather data from specific learning activities. Data results from Waypoint Outcomes are shared with the student and are also accessible by the faculty and program administrators.
In addition to course and program assessments, faculty instructional performance is continuously assessed by institutional deans and instructional specialists and through the results of student surveys at the completion of each course. The results of all our assessment practices are reviewed by an assessment team, including faculty, and based on their conclusions, recommendations may be made to add to or modify programs.
Branding and Marketing
We have invested significant resources in developing processes and implementing technologies that allow us to effectively identify, recruit and retain qualified students. We develop and participate in various marketing activities to generate leads for prospective students and to build the Zovio and Ashford brands.
For Ashford's online student population, we align ourselves with working adults, many of whom have already completed some postsecondary courses and are seeking an accessible, affordable education from a quality institution. The admissions policies that require a minimum age for online students at Ashford are focused on attracting students with a greater commitment to completing their degrees.
The Ashford branding campaigns utilize digital channels to communicate their message, and leads are generated from online sources. We also purchase keywords from search providers to generate online leads directly, rather than acquiring them solely through aggregators. Additionally, we have a team internally who focuses on generating online leads through search engine optimization techniques.
Recruiting and Admissions
Ashford employs teams who facilitate all aspects of enrollment and integration of a prospective student into a program of study. These teams consist of enrollment service advisors, financial services advisors and academic advisors. This structure promotes internal accountability among employees involved in identifying, recruiting, enrolling and retaining new students.
Prospective student leads are managed through a customer relations management (“CRM”) system, which directs a lead for a prospective student to a recruiting team and assigns an enrollment service advisor within that team to serve as the primary liaison for that prospective student. Once contact with a prospective student is established, the enrollment service advisor, along with the academic and financial services advisors, begins an assessment process to determine if Ashford's program offerings match the student's needs and objectives. Additionally, enrollment service advisors communicate other criteria, including expected duration and cost of the program, to the prospective student.
The enrollment service advisors go through a comprehensive training program that addresses Ashford's academic offerings, financial aid options and the regulatory environment in which we operate, including the restrictions imposed by regulations on the admissions process. We place significant emphasis on regulatory requirements and demand an environment of strict compliance.
Ashford has a presence in both military and corporate channels. Our military and academic outreach teams work with military education services officers, as well as with the military students we serve, to demonstrate the quality, impact and value that Ashford's programs provide to individuals in those organizations. Military students may frequently change locations or seek to complete a program intermittently over the course of several years. 
In the corporate channel, we have the Education Partnerships program. These corporate partnership programs provide companies with the opportunity to allow their employees to pursue and complete a college degree while incurring little to no 
student debt. We believe employers value Ashford's affordability, which allows employer tuition reimbursements to be used more efficiently.
The admissions process is designed to offer access to prospective students who seek the benefits of a postsecondary education. Ashford undergraduate students may qualify in various ways, including by having a high school diploma or a GED equivalent. Graduate level students at Ashford are required to have an undergraduate degree from an accredited college and may be required to have a minimum grade point average or meet other criteria to qualify for admission to certain programs. Doctoral students are required to have a master’s degree from a regionally or approved nationally accredited institution with a graduate-level cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher, or an earned Doctoral degree from a regionally or approved nationally accredited institution.
Retention
Once a student enrolls in an Ashford online program, the institution provides consistent, ongoing support to assist the student in acclimating to the online environment and to address challenges that arise in order to increase the likelihood that the student will persist through graduation.
Providing a superior learning experience is a key component in retaining students at Ashford. We believe that our team-based approach to recruitment and the robust student services we provide enhance retention because of the quality of each student's interaction with his or her team and the accountability inherent in the team structure. We also incorporate a systematic approach to contacting students at key milestones during their experience at Ashford, providing encouragement and highlighting their progress. There are frequent personal interactions between academic advisors and students, which we view as a key component to our retention strategy. Ashford has a team that monitors performance metrics and other key data to analyze student retention rates, as well as the causes of and potential risks for student drops. 
Our dispute resolution department serves as a neutral third-party for students to raise any concerns or complaints. Such concerns and complaints are then elevated to the appropriate department.
Ashford has various programs focused on academic quality and student success that we believe help students succeed in their courses, help retain higher quality students and ultimately increase student retention. Ashford has a free two-week orientation course that is mandatory for all incoming students who have not earned any previous college credits. The orientation is designed to provide students with a complete overview of the online classroom experience, prepare them for success in their courses and help them self-evaluate their readiness to succeed in an online college setting. The experience provides a realistic, up-front overview of expectations so that students are aware of what is expected of them as they prepare for their studies. Students also gain an understanding of how to access and navigate within the online classroom, so they can feel confident when they move to their first course in their respective programs. For students taking the orientation course, successful completion of the orientation is required before they can begin their first class.
Ashford also offers the “Ashford Promise,” which allows a student to experience the first three weeks of their first class before incurring any financial obligation. After the first three weeks, students who do not demonstrate satisfactory academic progress, or those who simply opt out, will not be admitted as students. These individuals will not be responsible for any tuition or fees, and therefore will not incur any debt. We believe the Ashford Promise initiative helps increase student retention while reducing the financial risk to the student.
Technology
We have created a scalable technology system that we believe is secure, reliable and redundant, and permits courses and support services to be offered online.
Online course delivery and management
Ashford utilizes the Canvas learning management system provided by Instructure, Inc. (“Instructure”), a third-party software and services provider. Canvas is a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform that enables us to develop and deliver the latest in engaging online learning experiences. As a native cloud platform, Canvas software and data are hosted by Amazon Web Services, providing for a fast, secure and readily scalable experience for Ashford's students and faculty. Additionally, students and faculty will have greater flexibility to learn and teach from anywhere, anytime and on any iOS or Android device.
Internal administration
Ashford utilizes a CRM application from Campus Management Corp. for lead management, workflow, analytics, reporting and a complete view of our students. This tool enables Ashford to view the entire student history from the lead to 
graduation, individually or in cohorts, and to respond appropriately. Additionally, Ashford utilizes online application portals to accept, integrate and process student applications.
Ashford utilizes CampusVue, a student information system provided by Campus Management Corp., to manage student data (including grades, attendance, status and financial aid) and to generate periodic management reports. This system interfaces with our online learning management system.
Constellation
Constellation is an innovative suite of interactive educational materials that increases the educational quality for online students at Ashford. Constellation is our proprietary learning platform that takes the best features of traditional textbooks and combines them with the best features of the internet to create a premium student experience. We developed Constellation as an alternative to third-party textbooks with digital course materials. Constellation gives students access to their digital course materials across platforms without sacrificing time-tested studying tools like highlighting and note taking. Constellation includes customized content geared to courses and students, combined with a robust set of features that make course materials engaging and accessible to students of various learning styles and abilities. Constellation is cloud-based and is compatible across operating systems, browsers and mobile technologies, including web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices. We have developed Constellation-enabled courses primarily in core classes to attempt to reach as many students as possible.
The Constellation team includes editors with extensive experience at leading textbook publishing firms. Highly qualified subject matter experts are recruited to author content that addresses course and institutional outcomes. Constellation digital texts are organized around accelerated courses.
Waypoint Outcomes
Waypoint Outcomes is our proprietary assessment software which provides learning and assessment tools to Ashford. The software combines classic rubric grading scales with easy, efficient technology to help educators teach writing, critical thinking and cognitive skills. Its sophisticated grading palette frees teachers to focus on meaningful, personalized feedback for students by automating repetitive tasks.
Mobile application technology
Ashford offers mobile applications compatible with most web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices in order to increase the accessibility of the student learning experience. The applications enable students to use their mobile device to contact support staff, complete discussion posts and review important information regarding their academic status. We have received positive feedback from students indicating that these mobile applications further their learning experience, and we have incorporated feedback received into the periodic updates to these mobile applications.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, Ashford had approximately 100 full-time faculty roles, including programs chairs, as well as approximately 2,590 active adjunct faculty. Adjunct faculty members are part-time employees engaged on a course-by-course basis and are compensated based upon a fixed amount per course, which varies among faculty members based on each individual's experience and background. In addition to teaching assignments, adjunct faculty members may also be asked to serve on student committees, such as comprehensive examination and dissertation committees, or assist with course development.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company and its institution also employed approximately 1,730 combined non-faculty staff in the areas of university services, academic advising and academic support, enrollment services, university administration, financial aid, information technology, human resources, corporate accounting, finance and other administrative functions. None of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with us.
Competition
The education technology services market is fairly new, with no individual company representing a significant market share. For Ashford specifically, the postsecondary education market is also highly fragmented and competitive, with no private or public institution representing a significant market share. Ashford competes primarily with public and private degree-granting regionally accredited colleges and universities. Many colleges and universities enroll working adults, in addition to traditional 18 to 24-year-old students. Many of those colleges and universities offer a variety of distance education and online initiatives. We believe that competitive factors in the postsecondary education market include the reputation of an institution among students and employers, the number of qualified and experienced faculty, the program costs, the relevant and accredited program offerings, the regulatory approvals, the convenient, flexible and dependable access to programs and classes, the 
relative marketing and selling effectiveness, the time necessary to earn a degree and the level of student support services. We expect to encounter increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including traditional colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions. We also own the domain name rights for Ashford, as well as other words and phrases important to our business. In addition, we have applied for domestic and international patents for certain technology developed by us. We also have registered copyrights for exemplary business course materials. In many instances, Ashford's course content is produced by faculty and other content experts under work-for-hire agreements pursuant to which we own the course content in return for a fixed development fee. In certain limited cases, course content is licensed from third parties on a royalty fee basis.
Environmental Matters
We believe our facilities are in material compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. For additional information on our environmental, social and governance programs and initiatives located on our website at http://www.zovio.com/our-story/corporate-social-responsibility.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate our business in one reportable segment and we have no significant foreign operations or assets located outside of the United States. For information about our revenues from external customers, measures of profits and losses, and total assets, see our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Proposed Changes in the Structure of our Operations
We plan to undertake a conversion transaction pursuant to which Ashford will separate from the Company through a series of conversion and merger transactions ultimately resulting in Ashford being owned and operated by AU NFP, a California nonprofit public benefit corporation that was formed for the purpose of the conversion transaction and is independent of the Company (“AU NFP”). Following the proposed conversion and separation of Ashford, we will continue to operate as an education technology services provider that would provide certain services to AU NFP, and potentially, in the future, to other customers. The services to AU NFP would be provided pursuant to a Service Agreement (as defined below) with the Company. The transactions described above are collectively hereinafter referred to as the “Conversion Transaction.” The Company and the trustees of Ashford and AU NFP have taken steps, including Ashford’s formation of a special independent negotiating committee, to protect Ashford’s and AU NFP’s independence in considering the Conversion Transaction in order to enable Ashford and AU NFP to act in the best interests of Ashford and its students.
In furtherance of the Conversion Transaction, on December 30, 2019, the Company and AU NFP entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the “LOI”) contemplating that the Company, Ashford and AU NFP would enter into an agreement and plan of conversion pursuant to which the Company, in exchange for $1.00 and entry into the Services Agreement (as defined below), would cause Ashford to separate from the Company through a series of conversion and merger transactions ultimately resulting in Ashford (inclusive of all of the operations and assets constituting Ashford) being independently owned and operated by AU NFP. The Company would retain the assets and contracts related to, and continue to operate, its educational technology and services business, including all employees and assets necessary to perform the services contemplated by the Services Agreement. The parties also contemplate entering into a transition services agreement, pursuant to which the Company would provide identified services to AU NFP for a period of up to five years in exchange for which AU NFP would pay to the Company its direct cost charges incurred in providing such services.
In connection with the Conversion Transaction, the Company would enter into a services agreement with AU NFP and Ashford (the “Services Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company would provide certain defined services to AU NFP, including recruiting services, student finance and financial aid advising services, student program and retention advising services, institutional support services, information technology services, and support services for academics. In exchange for providing the services under the Services Agreement, AU NFP would pay to the Company (i) AU NFP’s direct cost charges incurred in providing the services, plus (ii) a share of AU NFP’s revenue from tuition and fees. The LOI contemplates that AU NFP’s revenue from tuition and fees would be shared approximately 80.5% in favor of AU NFP and 19.5% in favor of the Company. During the first 10 years of the Services Agreement, the services fees payable by Ashford would be adjusted 
downward in an amount necessary for Ashford to achieve a composite score (as calculated by the Department) of 1.6 and an operating margin of 1.5% (provided, that the latter target would be calculated based on Ashford limiting increases in its cost per enrollment to no more than 2% per year). Any such fee adjustments (with limited exceptions for certain adjustments in the first year of the agreement) would be restored to the Company in years in which Ashford exceeds those two targets. The Company’s performance of the services under the Services Agreement would be subject to certain mutually agreeable key performance indicators and related remedies. The parties contemplate that the Services Agreement would have an initial term of 15 years, subject to renewal options, although AU NFP would have the right to terminate the agreement after 10 years.
The Company anticipates that the parties will simultaneously enter into and close the transaction (the “Closing”) on or before June 1, 2020. The Closing is subject to a number of closing conditions, and no assurance can be given that the Conversion Transaction will ultimately be completed. The Company anticipates the Department completing its review of the Conversion Transaction following the Closing. Customarily such review and notification of approval from the Department can take approximately 18 months following the Closing, but the Company could receive such approval prior to or after that time-period.
As previously disclosed, on October 7, 2019, the Company announced that in connection with the Conversion Transaction, the Department indicated that it would require AU NFP to post an irrevocable letter of credit with the Department within 10 days of the Conversion Transaction for approximately $103 million, representing the Department’s determination of 25% of the Title IV funding in fiscal year 2018 (the “25% LOC”). In entering the LOI with AU NFP, the Company contemplated having to guarantee, on AU NFP’s behalf, the 25% LOC and the Company is currently planning to obtain financing through a $103 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Facility”) in order to collateralize the 25% LOC. The Company anticipates that the Facility will be structured through the use of an insurance trust.

REGULATION
Ashford is an accredited institution of higher education that is subject to extensive regulation by a variety of agencies, including WSCUC (the agency that accredits Ashford), educational licensing authorities in states where it is physically located or conducts certain operations, and by the Department due to our participation in Title IV programs. Institutions that participate in Title IV programs are subject to an extensive set of laws and regulations. To participate in Title IV programs, a school must maintain authorization by the state education agency or agencies where it is physically located, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department and be certified by the Department as an eligible institution. Accrediting agencies provide an independent assessment of educational quality. The laws, regulations and standards of WSCUC, the Department and state agencies affect the vast majority of Ashford's operations.
Accreditation
Prior to being institutionally accredited by WSCUC in July 2013, Ashford had been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1950. WSCUC is one of seven regional accrediting agencies that accredits colleges and universities in the United States. Most traditional, public and private non-profit, degree-granting colleges and universities are accredited by one of these seven agencies.
Accreditation by WSCUC is recognized by the Department and by prospective students as a reliable indicator of educational quality. Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of an educational institution and its programs and an institution's effectiveness in carrying out its mission in areas including integrity, student performance, curriculum, educational effectiveness, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, financial stability and governance. To be recognized by the Department, an accrediting agency, among other things, must adopt specific standards to be maintained by educational institutions, conduct peer-review evaluations of institution's compliance with those standards, monitor compliance through periodic institutional reporting and the periodic renewal process and publicly designate those institutions that meet the agency's criteria. An accredited institution is subject to periodic review by its accrediting agency to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity, quality and other standards required for accreditation. An institution that is determined not to meet the standards of accreditation may have its accreditation revoked or not renewed.
Accreditation is important to Ashford as it establishes comprehensive criteria designed to promote educational quality and effectiveness. Accreditation also represents a public acknowledgment by a recognized independent agency of the quality and effectiveness of Ashford and its programs. It also facilitates the transferability of educational credits when students transfer to or apply for graduate school at other regionally accredited colleges and universities. The Department relies on accreditation as an indicator of educational quality and effectiveness in determining an institution's eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, as do certain corporate and government sponsors in connection with tuition reimbursement and other student aid programs.
We believe that regional accreditation is viewed favorably by certain students when choosing a school, by other schools when evaluating transfer and graduate school applications, and by certain employers when evaluating the credentials of candidates for employment.
WSCUC Accreditation of Ashford University
In July 2013, WSCUC granted Initial Accreditation to Ashford for five years, until July 2018. In December 2013, Ashford effected its transition to WSCUC accreditation and designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus and its Clinton, Iowa campus as an additional location. As part of the WSCUC Institutional Review Process a Reaffirmation of Accreditation Visit was conducted by an evaluation team April 3-5, 2019. At its meeting June 26-28, 2019, the Commission acted to reaffirm Ashford’s accreditation through Spring 2025. 
WSCUC also visited Ashford on May 1, 2019 to conduct its federally mandated, six-month post-implementation review, due to the merger of University of the Rockies and into Ashford which was finalized on October 31, 2018. WSCUC has verified that Ashford has met all post-implementation requirements related to the merger of the two entities.
In a separate action, Ashford submitted a change of control and legal status application (the “Change of Control Application”) related to the Conversion Transaction. On July 12, 2019, WSCUC notified Ashford that it had approved the Change of Control Application for the Conversion Transaction. The approval is subject to certain conditions which must be met prior to the close of the Conversion Transaction, including divestiture of financial and ownership interest in the Company by all Ashford officers and related parties and submission of a revised services agreement with respect to the Conversion Transaction, including the incorporation of key performance indicators into that agreement. WSCUC is also requiring a post-implementation site visit of Ashford within six months of the close of the Conversion Transaction.
U.S. Department of Education Abbreviated Preacquisition Review Letter
On October 7, 2019, the Company announced that in connection with the Conversion Transaction, the Department has provided a response (the “Abbreviated Preacquisition Review Letter”) to the request for review made on July 15, 2019. The request for an abbreviated preacquisition review was made in accordance with Department procedures pursuant to which the Department provides information about conditions it intends to impose in connection with the continued participation in federal Title IV student financial aid programs by the applicant following a change in ownership.
In the Abbreviated Preacquisition Review Letter, along with other conditions, the Department indicated that it would require the posting of the “25% LOC.” The 25% LOC would require coverage for 12 months, unless extended or replaced as determined by the Department. The Department is expected to conduct a post-closing review of Ashford following the change of control resulting from the Conversion Transaction consistent with the Department’s procedures during which the Department makes a determination on the institution’s request for recertification from the Department following the change of control, including whether to impose an increase in the letter of credit requirement or place other conditions or restrictions on Ashford.
Licensure by California BPPE
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. Ashford is approved by the California BPPE to operate as an accredited institution. As a result, Ashford is subject to laws and regulations applicable to private, postsecondary educational institutions located in California, including reporting requirements related to graduation, employment and licensing data, certain changes of ownership and control, faculty and programs, and student refund policies. Ashford also remains subject to other state and federal student employment data reporting and disclosure requirements.
Negotiated Rulemaking and Other Executive Action - State Authorization
On July 31, 2018, the Department published a notice in the Federal Register announcing its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee (the “Rulemaking Committee”) to prepare proposed regulations for the Federal Student Aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. In September 2018, interested parties commented at three public hearings on the topics suggested by the Department in the notice, and suggested additional topics for consideration for action by the Rulemaking Committee.
The Rulemaking Committee met from January 2019 through March 2019 on topics related to accreditation, competency-based education, state approval of online programs (commonly known as “state authorization”), and distance learning. The Rulemaking Committee reached consensus on all topics and the Department issued proposed regulations based on that consensus on June 12, 2019. On October 31, 2019, the Department issued final regulations on accreditation and state authorization to be effective on July 1, 2020.
The new regulations, among other things: (i) define the roles and responsibilities of accrediting agencies, States, and the Department in oversight of institutions participating in the Federal Student Aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (Title IV, Higher Education Act programs); (ii) establish “substantial compliance” as the standard for agency recognition; (iii) modify “substantive change” requirements to provide greater flexibility to institutions to innovate and respond to the needs of students and employers, while maintaining strict agency oversight in instances of more complicated or higher risk changes in institutional mission, program mix, or level of credential offered; (iv) clarify the Department’s accrediting agency recognition process, including accurate recognition of the geographic area within which an agency conducts business; and (v) modify the requirements for state authorization.
The new regulations provide for early implementation of select pieces of the state authorization component. However, Ashford has not chosen early implementation in this area.
For additional information regarding negotiated rulemaking, see also “Gainful employment” and “Defense to repayment” sections below. For additional information regarding state authorization, see the “State authorization” section below.
Authorization by Congress of Title IV Programs
Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program through the budget and appropriations process. In 2008, the Higher Education Act was reauthorized through September 2014 and on December 13, 2017, the House of Representatives’ Committee on Education and the Workforce passed H.R. 4508, the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act (“PROSPER Act”). No date has been set for consideration by the full House on the legislation, nor has a companion Higher Education Act reauthorization bill been introduced in the U.S. Senate. The Higher Education Act's programs will continue year-to-year without explicit reauthorization as long as Congress appropriates funds for the programs. Congress may propose and pass 
revisions to the Higher Education Act between reauthorizations by using other legislative vehicles such as budget bills and appropriations bills, which could impact funding for student financial aid programs.
Department Regulation of Title IV Programs
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must comply with the Higher Education Act and the regulations thereunder that are administered by the Department. Among other things, the law and regulations require that an institution (i) be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located, (ii) maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized for such purposes by the Department and (iii) be certified to participate in Title IV programs by the Department. Ashford's participation in Title IV programs allows for extensive oversight and review pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department. Those regulations are subject to revision and amendment from time to time by the Department. The Department's interpretation of its regulations likewise is subject to change. As a result, it is difficult to predict how Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances.
An institution must periodically seek recertification from the Department to continue to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department prior to seeking recertification.
On April 23, 2018, Ashford received an updated Program Participation Agreement (“PPA”) from the Department. Based on the updated PPA, Ashford is provisionally certified to participate in Federal Student Financial Aid Programs until March 31, 2021. Ashford is required to submit its reapplication for continued certification by December 31, 2020.
During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it may be subject to adverse action with fewer due process rights than those afforded to other institutions, and it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings, or the addition of certain programs.
The 90/10 rule
Under the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV program funds for two consecutive fiscal years, as calculated in accordance with Department regulations. This rule is commonly referred to as the “90/10 rule.” Any institution that violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. In addition, an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year is placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures. In September 2016, the Department issued new audit standards, for financial statement audits of proprietary institutions for fiscal years ending June 30, 2017 or later, which include a requirement that institutions must determine Title IV and non-Title IV revenue on a student by student basis. Based on this calculation, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Ashford derived 72.4% and 78.6%, respectively, of its respective cash revenues from Title IV program funds.
Revenue derived from government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, is not considered federal student aid for purposes of calculations under the 90/10 rule. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 27.4% of Ashford's students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive government tuition assistance that may be used to pursue postsecondary degrees.
Cohort default rate
For each federal fiscal year, the Department calculates a rate of student defaults over a three-year measuring period for each educational institution, which is known as a “cohort default rate.” An institution may lose eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program if, for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years, 30% or more of its students who became subject to a repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year defaulted on such obligation by the end of the following federal fiscal year.
The most recent official three-year cohort default rates for Ashford for the 2016, 2015 and 2014 federal fiscal years were 13.7%, 13.5% and 14.9%, respectively.
Financial responsibility
The Higher Education Act and Department regulations establish standards of financial responsibility that an institution must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. The Department evaluates compliance with these standards annually upon receipt of an institution's annual audited financial statements and when an institution applies to the Department to reestablish its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs following a change in ownership. One financial responsibility standard is based on the institution's composite score, which is derived from a formula established by the Department. The 
composite score is a number between negative 1.0 and positive 3.0. It must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further Department financial oversight. In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, meet all its financial obligations (including required refunds to students and any Title IV liabilities and debts), be current in its debt payments and not receive an adverse, qualified or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements. If an institution fails to satisfy the Department’s financial responsibility requirements, it could be limited in its access to or lose Title IV program funding, or it may be required to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department and possibly accept other conditions to its continued participation in Title IV programs.
For the prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the consolidated composite score calculated was 2.2, satisfying the composite score requirement of the Department's financial responsibility test. We expect the consolidated composite score for the year ended December 31, 2019 to be 0.7 and below the composite score requirement as a result of non-recurring restructuring and acquisition related charges. The Department has historically calculated Ashford’s composite score based on Zovio’s consolidated audited financial statements rather than Ashford’s stand alone audited financial statements. However, the deadline to submit audited financial statements to the Department is June 30, 2020, by which date we expect that Ashford will have been separated from Zovio as a result of the Conversion Transaction currently scheduled to close on or before June 1, 2020. Following separation and closing, and given that Ashford will no longer be owned by Zovio, Ashford will submit its stand-alone audited financial statements to the Department for the purpose of calculating the institution’s composite score. We expect Ashford’s composite score, based on its standalone audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, to be at least 1.6 and above the Department’s requirement for a composite score of 1.5 or greater.
If the Conversion Transaction is not completed as scheduled or the Department calculates Ashford’s composite score based on Zovio’s consolidated financial statements, the institution’s composite score for the period ended December 31, 2019 would be below the required composite score of at least 1.5. In such event, to continue participation in Title IV programs, Ashford would unless the Department accepts a previously submitted letter of credit toward the requirement, either need to: (1) submit a letter of credit equal to at least 50% or more of the Title IV Program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year; or (2) at the discretion of the Department, submit a letter of credit equal to at least 10% or more of the Title IV Program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year and accept additional conditions (including, but not limited to, a provisional certification, compliance with monitoring requirements, remain current on debt payments, meet certain financial obligations, agree to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than the Department’s standard advance funding arrangement, and agree to pay Title IV credit balances due to students before submitting a request for funds to the Department). The Department typically conducts its calculation of the composite score and its determination of any requirements arising from the composite score during the period after the institution submits audited financial statements to the Department. The institution is required to submit by the regulatory deadline of June 30, 2020. Therefore, we anticipate any potential letter of credit arising from the composite score would be due to the Department no earlier than the second half of 2020.
Substantial misrepresentation
The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. Under the Department's rules, a “misrepresentation” is any false, erroneous or misleading statement an institution, one of its representatives or any ineligible institution, organization or person with whom the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs or marketing, advertising, recruiting or admissions services makes directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, a state agency or the Department. The Department's rules define a “substantial misrepresentation” as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. For-profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).
On December 10, 2015, Ashford received a request for information from the Multi-Regional and Foreign School Participation Division of the Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid (“FSA”) for (i) advertising and marketing materials provided to prospective students regarding the transferability of certain credit, (ii) documents produced in response to the CFPB's August 10, 2015 Civil Investigative Demand related to the CFPB's investigation to determine whether for-profit postsecondary education companies or other unnamed persons have engaged in or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices related to the advertising, marketing or origination of private student loans, (iii) certain documents produced in response to subpoenas and interrogatories issued by the Attorney General of the State of California and (iv) records created between 2009 and 2012 related to the disbursement of certain Title IV funds. The FSA is reviewing representations made by Ashford to potential and enrolled students, and has asked us and Ashford to assist in its assessment of Ashford's compliance with the 
prohibition on substantial misrepresentations. We, together with Ashford, intend to provide the FSA with our full cooperation with a view toward demonstrating the compliant nature of our practices.
Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw
If a student who has received Title IV funds withdraws, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV program funds the student has earned pursuant to applicable regulations. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any payment period (which, for our undergraduate online students, is typically a 20-week term consisting of four five-week courses), the amount of Title IV funds that the student has earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds the student received or for which the student would otherwise be eligible for the payment period. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student is deemed to have earned 100% of the Title IV funds received. If the student has not earned all the Title IV funds disbursed, the institution must return the unearned funds to the appropriate lender or the Department in a timely manner, which is generally no later than 45 days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew. If an institution's annual financial aid compliance audit in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years determines that 5% or more of such returns were not timely made, the institution may be required to submit a letter of credit in favor of the Department equal to 25% of the amount of unearned Title IV funds the institution was required to return for its most recently completed fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, Ashford did not exceed the 5% threshold for late refunds sampled.
Gainful employment
In October 2014, the Department published gainful employment regulations impacting programs required to prepare graduates for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The gainful employment regulations became effective July 1, 2015, with certain institutional disclosure requirements which became effective early 2017. 
On July 1, 2019, the Department then published a final rule rescinding the Department’s 2014 gainful employment regulations. The Higher Education Act requires that regulations affecting programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act be published in final form by November 1, prior to the start of the award year (July 1) to which they become effective. This section also permits the Secretary of Education to designate any regulation as one that an entity subject to the regulations may choose to implement earlier, as well as conditions for early implementation. The Department designated the regulatory changes for early implementation, and an institution that early implements the rescission must document its early implementation internally. Ashford has chosen and documented early implementation.
Institutions that have early implemented the rescission of the gainful employment rule are not required to report gainful employment data to the National Student Loan Data System. Additionally, those that have early implemented are not required to include the disclosure template, or a link thereto, in their gainful employment program promotional materials and directly distribute the disclosure template to prospective students. Those that have early implemented should remove the template and any other gainful employment disclosures from their web pages.
Defense to repayment
On October 28, 2016, the Department published borrower defense to repayment regulations to change processes that assist students in gaining relief under certain provisions of the Direct Loan Program regulations. The defense to repayment provisions then in effect allowed a student to assert as a defense against repayment of federal direct loans any commission of fraud or other violation of applicable state law by the school related to such loans or the educational services for which the loans were provided. The borrower defense to repayment regulations were to become effective July 1, 2017.
On June 14, 2017, the Department announced a postponement of the 2016 defense to repayment regulations and its intention to resubmit the regulations through the negotiated rulemaking process. The Department announced an additional postponement on October 24, 2017. On February 14, 2018, the Department announced that it was postponing the effective date of this rule until July 1, 2019, so that it could complete the negotiated rulemaking process and develop the new regulations. Because the negotiated rulemaking committee did not reach consensus, the Department published a proposed regulation through a notice of proposed rulemaking (“NPRM”), took public comment, and planned to issue final regulations by November 1, 2018, effective July 1, 2019. This did not occur.
In September and October of 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a series of orders and opinions holding these procedural delays by the Department to be improper. The Court reinstated the 2016 repayment regulations as of October 16, 2018.
The 2016 defense to repayment regulations allow a borrower to assert a defense to repayment on the basis of a substantial misrepresentation, any other misrepresentation in cases where certain other factors are present, a breach of contract or a favorable nondefault contested judgment against a school for its act or omission relating to the making of the borrower’s loan or 
the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided. In addition, the financial responsibility standards contained in the new regulations establish the conditions or events that trigger the requirement for an institution to provide the Department with financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or other security against potential institutional liabilities. Triggering conditions or events include, among others, certain state, federal or accrediting agency actions or investigations, and in the case of publicly traded companies, receipt of certain warnings from the SEC or the applicable stock exchange, or the failure to timely file a required annual or quarterly report with the SEC. The new regulations also prohibit schools from requiring that students agree to settle future disputes through arbitration.
On March 15, 2019, the Department issued guidance for the implementation of parts of the regulations. The guidance covers an institution's responsibility in regard to reporting mandatory and discretionary triggers as part of the financial responsibility standards, class action bans and pre-dispute arbitration agreements, submission of arbitral and judicial records, and repayment rates. We will continue to monitor guidance on or changes to these 2016 regulations that are currently in effect subject to the early implementation of the 2019 regulations described below.
On August 30, 2019, the Department finalized the regulations derived from the 2017-2018 negotiated rulemaking process and subsequent public comments. This version of the borrower defense regulations applies to all federal student loans made on or after July 1, 2020, and, among other things: (i) grants borrowers the right to assert borrower defense to repayment claims against institutions, regardless of whether the loan is in default or in collection proceedings; (ii) allows borrowers to file defense to repayment claims three years from either the student's date of graduation or withdrawal from the institution; and (iii) gives students the ability to allege a specific amount of financial harm and to obtain relief in an amount determined by the Department, which may be greater or lesser than their original claim amount. It also includes financial triggers and other factors for recalculating an institution's financial responsibility composite score that differ from those in the 2016 regulations.
The regulations will take effect July 1, 2020; however, the regulations relating to financial responsibility are available for early implementation. Ashford has chosen and documented early implementation in this area.
Potential sanctions for noncompliance with Title IV regulations
The Department can impose sanctions for violating the statutory and regulatory requirements of Title IV programs, including:
•transferring an institution from the advance method or the heightened cash monitoring level one method of Title IV payment, each of which permit the institution to receive Title IV funds before or concurrently with disbursing them to students, to the heightened cash monitoring level two method of payment or to the reimbursement method of payment, each of which delay an institution's receipt of Title IV funds until student eligibility has been verified by the Department;
•imposing a monetary liability against an institution in an amount equal to any funds determined to have been improperly disbursed or not to have been properly returned upon student withdrawal;
•requiring an institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department as a condition for continued Title IV eligibility;
•initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate an institution's participation in Title IV programs;
•referring a matter for possible civil or criminal investigation;
•failing to grant an institution's application for renewal of its certification, or revocation of an institution's provisional certification, to participate in Title IV programs, or imposing conditions on its participation in Title IV programs; or
•taking emergency action to suspend an institution's participation in Title IV programs without prior notice or a prior opportunity for a hearing.
Compliance reviews, audits and reports
Ashford is subject to reviews in connection with periodic renewals of certification to participate in Title IV programs, as well as announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the Department and the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”). The Department periodically reviews institutions participating in Title IV programs for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The OIG is responsible for promoting the efficiency, effectiveness and integrity of the Department's programs and operations, including through the performance of general audits of institutions' administration of federal funds and investigations of fraud, abuse or other wrongdoing by institutions.
State licensing agencies, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and accrediting bodies may also conduct audits and reviews of a similar fashion. In addition, as part of the Department's ongoing monitoring of institutions' administration of Title IV programs, the Higher Education Act requires institutions to submit to the Department an annual Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accounting firm. Each institution must also annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and Department regulations to enable the Department to make a determination of an institution's financial responsibility.
Department of Education Open Program Review of Ashford
In July 2016, Ashford was notified by the Department that an off-site program review had been scheduled to assess Ashford’s administration of the Title IV programs in which it participates. The off-site program review commenced in July 2016 and covered students identified in the 2009-2012 calendar year data previously provided by Ashford to the Department in response to a request for information received from the Multi-Regional and Foreign School Participation Division of the Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid (the “FSA”) in December 2015, but may be expanded if the Department deems such expansion appropriate.
In December 2016, the Department informed Ashford that it intended to perform an on-site program review. The on-site program review commenced in January 2017 and initially covered the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 award years, but may be expanded if the Department deems such an expansion appropriate. To date, we have not received a draft report from the Department.
GI Bill Benefits
In May 2016, the Iowa Department of Education (“Iowa DOE”), which is the Iowa State Approving Agency (“SAA”), informed the Company that, as a result of the planned closure of the Clinton Campus, the Iowa DOE would no longer continue to approve Ashford’s programs for GI Bill benefits after June 30, 2016, and recommending Ashford seek approval through the SAA for any location that met what the Iowa DOE determined to be the definition of a “main campus” or “branch campus.” Ashford began the process of applying for approval through the California SAA (“CSAAVE”).
In June 2016, the Iowa DOE issued a stay of its intended withdrawal of approval of Ashford’s programs for GI Bill benefits effective until the earlier of (i) 90 days from June 20, 2016, or (ii) the date on which CSAAVE completed its review and issued a decision regarding the approval of Ashford in California. CSAAVE subsequently indicated that additional information and documentation would be required before Ashford’s application could be considered. Ashford then withdrew the CSAAVE application and continued working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) and the Iowa DOE to obtain continued approval of Ashford’s programs for GI Bill benefits and to prevent any disruption of educational benefits to Ashford's veteran students.
In June 2016, Ashford filed suit in the Iowa District Court for Polk County challenging the Iowa DOE’s announced intention to withdraw Ashford’s approval as a GI Bill eligible institution. In September 2016, the Iowa District Court entered a written order (“Order”) staying the Iowa DOE’s announced intention to withdraw the approval of Ashford as a GI Bill eligible institution. That suit has been appealed to the Iowa Supreme Court and remanded to the Iowa District Court for Polk County, but the Order remains in place. The suit is currently set for a hearing on the merits in the Iowa District Court for Polk County on March 13, 2020.
On July 6, 2017, Ashford received approval from the Arizona State Approving Agency (“ASAA”) to provide GI Bill benefits to its students. On November 9, 2017, the VA informed Ashford that the ASAA had not provided sufficient evidence to establish that it has jurisdictional authority over Ashford’s online programs. The VA stated an intention to suspend payment of educational assistance and approval of new student enrollments and student re-enrollments for Ashford’s online programs in 60 days unless corrective action was taken.
On November 17, 2017, Ashford filed a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit challenging the VA’s actions. The VA agreed to stay the announced suspensions for the duration of the Federal Circuit litigation, on the condition that Ashford request and submit an application for approval to CSAAVE on or before January 8, 2018. Ashford submitted an application to CSAAVE for approval on January 5, 2018. CSAAVE, however, declined to act on that application. At the VA’s request, Ashford submitted another approval application to CSAAVE on November 19, 2018. CSAAVE likewise declined to act on that application.
On September 6, 2019, the VA announced that effective October 1, 2019, the VA would be assuming the functions of the SAA for California, based on its negative assessment of CSAAVE’s performance during the preceding three years. On October 14, 2019 Ashford submitted an application for approval in California to the VA. On February 14, 2020 Ashford received notice from the VA, serving as CSAAVE, that Ashford meets the criteria for approval for Veterans education under the provisions of 
Title 38, United States Code, Section 3675, and that the VA had approved substantially all of Ashford’s programs that students and potential students could pursue using their GI Bill benefits, retroactive to July 1, 2019.
The parties completed all briefing for the Federal Circuit petition for review on May 3, 2019 and the Court held oral argument on October 2, 2019. The Court has not yet issued a ruling.
Adding teaching locations and implementing new educational programs
The requirements and standards of accrediting agencies, state education agencies and the Department limit Ashford's ability in certain instances to establish additional teaching locations or implement new educational programs. WSCUC and state education agencies that may authorize or accredit Ashford or its programs, generally require institutions to notify them in advance of adding certain new locations or implementing certain new programs, and may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial, academic and other qualifications of the institution. In addition, if an institution participating in Title IV programs plans to add a new location or educational program, the institution must apply under certain circumstances to the Department to have the new location or educational program designated as within the scope of the institution's Title IV eligibility.
On April 23, 2018, Ashford received an updated Program Participation Agreement (“PPA”) from the Department. Based on the updated PPA, Ashford is provisionally certified to participate in Federal Student Financial Aid Programs until March 31, 2021. Ashford was previously eligible to participate on a month-to-month basis while its reapplication for certification was pending with the Department. As a result of the updated PPA, Ashford’s previously pending educational programs have been approved and Ashford is required to submit its reapplication for continued certification by December 31, 2020. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change, including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings or the addition of certain programs.
Change in ownership resulting in a change of control
The Department and most state and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes of control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or operations. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control may include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution's common stock and significant changes in the composition of an institution's governing board. The types of thresholds for such reporting and approval vary among the states and among accrediting agencies. The Department regulations provide that a change of control occurs for a publicly traded corporation if either (i) a person acquires such ownership and control of the corporation so that the corporation is required to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing a change of control or (ii) the corporation's largest stockholder who owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation, ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder owning at least 25% of the total stock. A significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by the Department to be a change of control under this standard. In such event, the regulatory procedures applicable to a change in ownership and control would have to be followed in connection with the transaction. Similarly, if such a disposition were deemed a change of control by the applicable accreditor or state educational licensing agency, any required regulatory notifications and approvals would have to be made or obtained.
Privacy of student records
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”) and the Department's FERPA regulations require educational institutions to, among other things, protect the privacy of students' educational records by limiting an institution's disclosure of a student's personally identifiable information without the student's prior written consent. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, the Department may require the institution to take corrective action or may terminate the institution's receipt of federal funds. Educational institutions are also obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), which requires an institution to, among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective action, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the FTC, and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC.
State authorization
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. An institution is legally authorized by a state if, among other things, it meets one of the following sets of requirements:
•the state establishes the institution by name as an educational institution through a charter, statute, constitutional provision or other action issued by an appropriate state agency or state entity and is authorized to operate educational programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate; the institution complies with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements, except that the state may exempt the institution from any state approval or licensure requirement based on the institution's accreditation by one or more accrediting agencies recognized by the Department or based upon the institution being in operation for at least 20 years; and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution including the enforcement of state laws;
•the institution is established by the state on the basis of an authorization to conduct business in the state or to operate as a nonprofit charitable organization; the institution, by name, is approved or licensed by the state to offer programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate; and the institution is not exempt from the state's approval or licensure requirements based on accreditation, years in operation, or other comparable exemption; and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution including the enforcement of state laws; or
•the institution is exempt from state authorization as a religious institution under the state constitution or by state law, and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution and to enforce applicable state laws.
The Department has stated that it will not publish a list of states that meet, or fail to meet, the above requirements, and it is unclear how the Department will interpret these requirements in each state.
The regulations also provide that if an institution is offering postsecondary education through distance or correspondence education to students in a state in which it is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state, the institution must meet any state requirements to legally offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education to students in that state. Additionally, upon request by the Department, an institution must be able to document that it has the applicable state approval. For additional information, see “Negotiated Rulemaking and Other Executive Action – State Authorization” above and “State Education Licensure and Regulation” below.
State Education Licensure and Regulation
California, Arizona, Iowa and Colorado
The Higher Education Act requires Ashford to be legally authorized in the states in which it is physically located to participate in Title IV programs, and Department regulations impose Title IV program requirements for an institution to be considered legally authorized by a state.
Ashford had designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus for Title IV purposes. Ashford timely submitted to California BPPE an application to renew its approval to operate as an accredited institution on May 7, 2018. Ashford remains authorized in the state of California by California BPPE while the renewal application is pending review and approval. For additional information, see “Regulation - Licensure by California BPPE” above.
Ashford also has physical locations in Arizona, Colorado and Iowa. Ashford is authorized to operate an administrative center in Arizona by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education (“State Board”) until June 30, 2020. To maintain its Arizona authorization, the university must comply with applicable requirements under Arizona statutes and rules. Ashford is authorized to operate as a place of business in Colorado by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. To maintain its Colorado authorization, the university must comply with applicable requirements under Colorado statutes and rules. Ashford timely submitted to Iowa College Student Aid Commission (“ICSAC”) an application to renew its registration as a postsecondary school on November 14, 2019. Ashford remains authorized in the state of Iowa by ICSAC while the renewal application is pending review and approval. To maintain its Iowa registration, Ashford must comply with applicable requirements under Iowa statutes and rules.
Additional state regulation
Most state education agencies impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries. Several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over out-of-state educational institutions offering online programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state but have some activity in the state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. In addition to California, Arizona, Iowa and Colorado, we have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the applicable state education agency, and we have obtained state education agency approvals in certain states as determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities. We review state licensure requirements on a regular basis to determine whether our activities in those states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization. Because we enroll students throughout the United States, we may have to seek licensure or authorization in additional states in the future.
