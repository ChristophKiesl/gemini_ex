ITEM 1.    Business
Overview
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, primarily operates, franchises, and develops casual dining restaurants in North America famous for serving more than two dozen craveable, high-quality burgers with Bottomless Steak Fries® in a fun environment welcoming to Guests of all ages. 
We opened the first Red Robin® restaurant in Seattle, Washington in September 1969. In 1979, the first franchised Red Robin restaurant was opened in Yakima, Washington. In 2001, we formed Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and consummated a reorganization of the Company. Since that time, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. has owned, either directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding capital stock or membership interests, respectively, of Red Robin International, Inc. and our other operating subsidiaries through which we operate our Company-owned restaurants. Unless otherwise provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to "Red Robin," "we," "us," "our", or the "Company" refer to Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries.
As of the end of our fiscal year on December 27, 2020, there were 546 Red Robin restaurants, of which 443 were Company-owned and 103 were operated by franchisees. Our franchisees are independent organizations to whom we provide certain support. See "Restaurant Franchise and Licensing Arrangements" for additional information about our franchise program. As of December 27, 2020, there were Red Robin restaurants in 44 states and one Canadian province.
The Company operates its business as one operating and one reportable segment. Financial information for our operating segment is included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company's fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the last Sunday of the calendar year. We refer to our fiscal years as 2020, 2019, and 2018 throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal years, fiscal year end dates, and the number of weeks in each period are summarized in the table below:

Business Strategy
We entered 2020 with accelerating business momentum due to the implementation of our transformation strategy. The strategy was developed based on comprehensive Guest-led studies that provided data driven and actionable information on how to align the Red Robin brand with our Guests. Our Guests are every-day people seeking time with friends and family across a robust, diverse, and multi-generational demographic with a large majority falling into the Gen X, Millennial, and Centennial generations. We believe our broad demographic appeal positions us well for future growth.
With the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, the Company entered an unprecedented time for our business and industry. While the pandemic brought forth complex challenges, it also enabled us to intensely focus on improving our operating and financial model. The material improvements made to our business enabled us to resume our transformation strategy in an even stronger position. Our transformation strategy includes the following four fundamental elements:
•Recapture our Soul.    
Our differentiated brand promise is to deliver memorable moments connecting family, friends, and fun. We engage with our Guests by delivering burgers and other mainstream favorites in a casual, playful atmosphere. We feature the highest quality burgers with a creative take on traditional, shareable foods like Donatos® pizza and wings, milkshakes, beer, and our signature all-you-can-eat Bottomless Steak Fries®. A visit to our restaurant encourages Guests to determine the pace of their experience based on their occasion and connect with the people around the table, providing them "The Gift of Time".

•Deliver the Promise.    
We are accountable for consistently delivering our brand promise to our Guests. We accelerated the implementation of our new hospitality model, Total Guest Experience ("TGX"), during 2020 as dining rooms reopened. TGX combines technology and improved service coverage to deliver an elevated and more attentive Guest experience. TGX improved speed of service (including decreased ticket and window times), increased cleanliness scores, and contributed to highest ever product quality and overall Guest satisfaction scores. TGX enables our servers to stay in their section the majority of the time to engage with Guests while server partners deliver food, beverages, refills, and clear dishes. Restructuring our restaurant management labor model has also created greater flexibility during peak times. Our restructured labor model benefits both our Guests and our Team Members, as it supports our hospitality model improvements while also creating a structured and clear career path for Team Members. Both TGX and the new restaurant management labor model are contributing to our highest ever Guest satisfaction scores.
Pivoting to off-premise only at the onset of the pandemic required our Team Members to focus on improving the execution of our off-premise channel. We leveraged technology and process enhancements to provide a seamless and frictionless off-premise experience to our Guests. We also implemented a triple check accuracy program, ensuring every order goes through three checks before being handed to the Guest. Our improvements resulted in approximately a 40% increase in order accuracy, and a 50% increase in overall off-premise Guest satisfaction scores, even as off-premise sales more than doubled compared to the prior year. We believe these technological and operational improvements in conjunction with additional enhancements underway in 2021 will enable Red Robin to generate and maintain off-premise sales levels well above those generated prior to the pandemic. We believe that delivering on our brand promise will drive growth in Guests visits and brand advocacy.
•Tell Our Story.    
We launched our "All the Fulls" brand campaign in the third quarter of 2019. The campaign emphasizes the emotional appeal of our brand promise of driving memorable moments of connection, connecting Guests where and how they consume media, and reinforcing key aspects of our brand, including our quality burgers and shareable mainstream favorites, in a family friendly atmosphere. This has transformed the emphasis of our messaging from price to highlighting the value our brand provides.
Our core Guest is generally younger than that of the casual dining category and more active in the digital space, which has allowed us to further leverage digital marketing strategies that are more effective and cost efficient. We also enhanced segmentation and targeting in our over nine million member Red Robin RoyaltyTM program, bringing loyalty engagement to best-ever levels. Our marketing strategy has driven improved engagement with our Guests, and we expect it to continue to drive engagement with our brand in the future.
•Accelerate Profitable Growth
We seek to accelerate profitable sales growth through selective focus on fewer and more impactful initiatives that will drive significant top and bottom-line results. During the pandemic, Red Robin permanently reduced costs with the expectation to deliver more than 100 basis points of permanent incremental enterprise-level margin improvement once we return to pre-COVID-19 sales volumes. Additionally, we launched Red Robin last-mile delivery in 2020 which provides Guests the ability to utilize our unique loyalty program when ordering off-premise. Further, in 2020, we announced our partnership with Donatos®, a high-quality pizza brand "nested" inside of Red Robin restaurants, that we expect to drive incremental top-line sales and gross margin and give Guests another reason to choose Red Robin. At the end of 2020, we resumed the implementation of Donatos® bringing the total of number of Company-owned restaurants that offer it to 79. In 2021, we plan to add Donatos® to approximately 120 Company-owned restaurants, bringing the total number of Company-owned restaurants that offer Donatos® to approximately 200 by the end of the year. We believe Donatos® will generate annual Company pizza sales of more than $60 million and profitability of more than $25 million by 2023, when we expect to have completed our rollout to approximately 400 Company-owned restaurants. 
As the Company emerges from the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic, and we adapt to operating in a post-pandemic environment within the casual dining space, we are preparing our Team Members with a prescriptive "Ready-Set-Reopen" playbook, guiding best practices for operating our indoor dining rooms at 100% capacity. We believe pent up demand, coupled with our record high Guest satisfaction scores, positions us well to welcome our Guests back to Red Robin with frequency.

Restaurant Concept
The Red Robin brand has many desirable attributes, including a range of high-quality menu items, a strong Guest-focused culture, and a strong value proposition, where our Guests experience memorable moments of connection with family, friends, and fun.
We pride ourselves on our Gourmet Burgers and other mainstream favorites served in a casual, playful atmosphere. Our menu features our signature product, a line of Gourmet Burgers made from premium quality, fresh ground beef. To complement our best-selling Gourmet Burgers, we offer an everyday-value line of Red's Tavern Double® burgers, and Red Robin's Finest line made with premium toppings. We also offer burgers made with other proteins including chicken breasts (grilled or fried), turkey patties, as well as a proprietary vegetarian patty and the Impossible™ plant-based burger patty. We offer a selection of buns, including gluten free, sesame, whole grain, and lettuce wraps, with a variety of toppings, including house-made sauces, crispy onion straws, sautéed mushrooms, several cheese choices, and a fried egg. All of our burgers are served with our all-you-can-eat Bottomless Steak Fries® or Guests may choose from other side options. We specialize in customizing our menu items to meet our Guests' dietary needs and preferences and have received recognition from experts in the allergen community. In addition to burgers, which accounted for 59% of food sales in 2020, Red Robin serves an array of other mainstream favorites that appeal to our Guests. These items include a variety of shareable foods like Donatos® pizza and wings, salads, soups, seafood, and other entrees. We also offer a range of single-serve and shareable desserts as well as our milkshakes. Our beverages include signature alcoholic and non-alcoholic specialty drinks, cocktails, wine, and a variety of national and craft beers.
We strive to give our Guests the choice of the pace of their experience based on their occasion, from accommodating time-pressured meals to offering a place to relax and connect with friends. Red Robin also has an extraordinary approach to Guest service, and we have cataloged thousands of stories of Red Robin Team Members who live our values. Many examples can be found on our website, www.redrobin.com. Note that our website and the information contained on or connected to our website are not incorporated by reference herein, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.
We also strive to provide our Guests with exceptional dining value and the ability to customize their experience. In 2020, we had an average check per Guest of $13.26 including beverages. Average Guest check decreased compared to 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic restricting indoor dining resulting in a higher off-premise sales mix. We believe our price-to-value relationship, featuring our innovative array of quality burgers, differentiates us from our casual dining competitors and allows us to appeal to a broad base of middle income, multi-generational consumers.
Human Capital Management
We strive to ensure our employees, whom we refer to as Team Members, are Better for Being Here through our core B.U.R.G.E.R values: Bottomless Fun, Unwavering Integrity, Relentless Focus on Improvement, Genuine Spirit of Service, Extraordinary People, and Recognized Burger Authority. Each of these values work to empower and develop our Team Members and has created a Company culture that we collectively take pride in every day. We reward and incentivize our Team Members with competitive pay, recognition and rewards, and benefit programs. We also provide our Team Members the opportunity to grow and develop, promote health and safety, and value inclusion, diversity, and engagement.
As part of our human capital management strategy, we focus on the following areas:
Our Team Members
As of December 27, 2020, we had 21,374 Team Members consisting of 20,968 Team Members at Company-owned restaurants and 406 restaurant support center and field-based Team Members. We are currently 99% staffed at the restaurant manager level, and our restaurant Team Member turnover rate is approaching industry best-in-class targets. We focus on General Manager tenure in restaurants and its positive link to Guest traffic, overall Guest satisfaction, and Team Member turnover trends. Our General Manager turnover during 2020 was 19.3%, and 74% of General Managers have been managing their current restaurant for a year or more. None of our Team Members is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our Team Member relations to be good, and we have not experienced any significant work stoppages during 2020.

Competitive Compensation and Benefits
We support our Team Members by offering market-competitive wages and benefits for eligible Team Members. We pay competitive, prevailing wages, and our only positions paid below minimum wage at the restaurant level are our tipped Team Members who are paid at the state tip credit rate or state minimum wage rate. All other positions are paid at or above minimum wage, and we ensure tipped positions make more than minimum wage when including tips. Our benefits programs include medical and other insurance, employee assistance programs, shift meals, Red Robin meal discounts, paid time off, 401(k) with employer match, tuition reimbursement, an employee stock purchase plan, and equity-based awards for eligible restaurant support center and operations Team Members, generally, at the director level and above. The Red Robin Perks program also provides discounts on a wide range of products and services, including cell phone bills, technology purchases, movie tickets, gym memberships, and vacation packages. Additionally, we motivate and support healthy work/life balance and flexible working arrangements for restaurant support center Team Members.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented an emergency sick pay policy for Team Members in all states. While our restaurants were closed or on reduced capacity, we provided assistance to Team Members looking for additional hours. We partnered with grocery stores, an online retailer, restaurant delivery drivers, and a technology partner in order to provide early visibility to available jobs, streamlined applications, and interviews.
Our compensation and performance evaluation systems are carefully designed to maintain pay equity by focusing pay decisions on experience and performance to ensure the Company retains a highly productive workforce to operate our business while providing a high level of service to our Guests.
Health and Safety
We have traditionally been a leader in health and safety and have implemented new practices during the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with that leadership position. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to navigate an unprecedented time for our business and industry. We operate with the health, safety, and well-being of Red Robin's Team Members, Guests, and communities in mind with strict adherence to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state, and local guidelines as our top priority.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we require that Team Members take temperature checks prior to entering the restaurant and wear a face mask at all times while in the restaurant except when eating, and we provide personal protective equipment for our restaurant Team Members. We also have implemented a six-foot distancing playbook that allows managers to maintain a six-foot distance from others while performing their daily tasks, one-on-one meetings, Team Member interactions, orientations, and interviews. We provided COVID-19 testing coverage for our restaurant Team Members through our benefit plans before it was required, and we plan to continue offering testing.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we immediately instituted telecommuting policies at the restaurant support center to support working from home and will not bring Team Members back to the office before it is deemed safe by public health officials. Through the Leading from a Distance workshop, we taught skills to restaurant support center and restaurant Team Members in supervisor positions that helped to continue to drive performance during a time where face-to-face interaction was limited. These workshops focused on creating engagement, communication, and accountability. We began offering these workshops before the COVID-19 pandemic, so our Team Members in supervisor positions were able to use these skills to aid in a smooth transition into the COVID-19 operating environment. We are assessing opportunities for a more permanent remote work force at the restaurant support center.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
At Red Robin, we value diversity and inclusion. We have a successful Women's Excellence program, a Company-wide resource group to support and inspire Team Members through development, networking, leadership, and other resources while fueling a culture of opportunity and diversity, and we continue to partner with the Women's Foodservice Forum, which has been instrumental in providing valuable resources and insights to help the advancement of our female leaders. During 2020, we also began holding focus groups on the topics of social and economic inequality. These informal focus groups include Team Members from all levels of the Company led by a key leader trained as a moderator to facilitate a discussion about social and economic inequality and how we as a Company can work together towards building a more equitable and just society.
We recently launched an initiative with the assistance of a diversity consultant to identify areas of opportunity for expanded diversity and inclusion practices in our Company and to support the development and execution of a comprehensive long-term diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy for Red Robin.

Restaurant Management
Our typical restaurant management team consists of a general manager, an assistant general manager, one to two associate managers, and additional shift supervisors depending on restaurant sales volumes. With our restaurant management restructuring completed in 2020, we will be able to fluctuate supervision needs more easily to better adjust to sales volumes in our restaurants. This improves our ability to manage effectively by placing more management and supervision in the restaurants during peak times. It also expanded our talent pipeline with additional capacity for entry-level restaurant managers. This provides a structured and clear career path for our Team Members and allows us to broaden our external candidate pool beyond individuals with full service dining experience. 
The management team of each restaurant is responsible for the day-to-day operation of that restaurant, including hiring, training, and coaching of Team Members, as well as operating results. Our typical restaurant employs approximately 55 Team Members, most of whom work part-time on an hourly basis.
Learning and Development
We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the training and development of Team Members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to Team Member performance, Guest satisfaction, food and beverage preparation, and the maintenance of our restaurants. Each restaurant maintains a group of certified learning coaches, including a head learning coach, who collectively are tasked with preparing new Team Members for success by providing on-the-job training leading up to a final skills certification for their position. Team Members seeking advancement have the opportunity to join our management development program as a Shift Supervisor. We continue to focus on hiring, training, and retaining our Team Members as we believe this is key to maintaining quality and consistency in each of our restaurants.
Shift Supervisors complete an in-depth training curriculum that develops their ability to supervise all aspects of shift execution, including, but not limited to, food safety, food production, Team Member coaching, creating memorable moments of connection with our Guests, ensuring Guest satisfaction, and financial aspects of the business. The Shift Supervisor program is an important steppingstone for hourly Team Members who desire a career in restaurant management.
New restaurant managers participate in our eight-week Management Foundations training program. This program hones each manager's skills, specifically in two areas: flawless shift execution and effective coaching of Team Members.
Through these learning and development practices at the restaurants, the majority of current restaurant management Team Members have been promoted from within.
Providing our restaurant teams the support and resources they need to be successful requires dedication, an of-service attitude, and the utmost professionalism on the part of our restaurant support center team. We ensure the restaurant support center Team Members have what they need to meet these demands by offering several avenues to enhance their professional development, including but not limited to, an in-house leadership library of over 400 titles, more than 40 remote learning development opportunities, one-on-one career coaching, and the opportunity to attend conferences in their field.
Team Member Engagement
We regularly collect feedback to better understand and improve Team Member experience and identify opportunities to strengthen our culture. We welcome open, candid feedback to ensure Team Members feel heard and engaged and to better support the values important to each of our Team Members. We accomplish this through a variety of programs and forums, including town halls, virtual open forums, Heart Checks, one-on-one coaching meetings, Discovery cards, Quality Circles, and Team Member Voice. Heart Checks are performed at the beginning of restaurant team monthly performance meetings and allow for restaurant Team Members to candidly share their thoughts and feelings about Red Robin with members of the restaurant's leadership team. During Discovery card sessions, a Team Member reviews a set of theme cards with statements such as, "I feel valued at my company and my opinions matter". The Team Member then interprets each card and places the cards in one of three columns, strengths, opportunities, and neutral, based on their opinion of each Discovery card statement. The session leader then asks the Team Member in a one-on-one setting to elaborate on why they placed each card in the respective columns. Quality Circles are informal meetings including Team Members from all levels of the Company led by a key leader who facilitates a discussion about current events and issues affecting the Company and our Team Members. Team Member Voice is an annual anonymous survey taken by every Team Member in the Company where they can respond to statements on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The statements included on the survey cover topics such as satisfaction with their supervisor, direction of the Company, intention to remain at Red Robin, and receiving the tools necessary to succeed in their position. Results are separated between restaurant support center Team Members and restaurant Team Members, and then results are shared with Team Members in a supervisor position. In addition to these structured programs and forums, we maintain an open-door policy at all levels of the Company. Our Company remains committed to offering Team Members numerous opportunities to have their voices heard because we believe our Team Members are our most valuable resource.

Food Safety and Purchasing
Our food safety and quality assurance programs help manage our commitment to quality ingredients and food preparation. Our systems are designed to protect our food supply from product receipt through preparation and service. We provide detailed specifications for our proprietary food ingredients, products, and supplies to our suppliers. We qualify and audit on an annual basis all of our food and beverage suppliers, as well as growers. Their certifications must comply with the Global Food Safety Initiative, if applicable. Our restaurant managers are certified in a comprehensive safety and sanitation course by the National Restaurant Association's ServSafe program. Strict food safety protocols, including safe cooking temperature requirements, food handling procedures, cooling procedures, and frequent temperature and quality checks, ensure the safety and quality of the food we serve in our restaurants. In order to provide the freshest ingredients and products and to maximize operating efficiencies between purchase and usage, each restaurant's management team determines the restaurant's daily usage requirements for food ingredients, products, and supplies, and accordingly, orders from approved suppliers, and distributors. The restaurant management team inspects deliveries to ensure that the products received meet our safety and quality specifications. Additionally, we engage an independent auditing company to perform unannounced comprehensive food safety and sanitation inspections up to four times a year in all Company-owned and franchised restaurants.
To maximize our purchasing efficiencies and obtain the best possible prices for our high-quality ingredients, products, and supplies, our centralized purchasing team negotiates supply agreements that may include fixed price contracts that can vary in term or formula-based pricing agreements that can fluctuate on changes in raw material commodity pricing. Of our total cost of goods in 2020, ground beef represented approximately 17%, potatoes represented approximately 13%, and poultry represented approximately 10%. We monitor the market for the primary commodities we purchase and extend contract positions when applicable in order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability. However, certain commodities, primarily cheese and ground beef, have historically been subject to market price fluctuations. We continue to identify competitively priced, high quality alternative manufacturers, suppliers, growers, and distributors that are available should the need arise; however, to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain. As of December 27, 2020, approximately 60% of our estimated annual food and beverage purchases were covered by fixed price contracts, most of which are scheduled to expire at various times through the end of 2021.
Restaurant Development
Red Robin has grown its restaurant base prudently, considering a number of factors, including general economic conditions, expected financial performance, availability of appropriate locations, competition in local markets, and the availability of teams to manage new locations. Our site selection criteria focuses on identifying markets, trade areas, and specific sites that are likely to yield the greatest density of desirable demographic characteristics, retail traffic, and visibility. Based on these factors and the effects of COVID-19 on our business, we did not have new corporate unit growth in 2020.
In 2020, we announced our partnership with Donatos®, a high-quality pizza brand "nested" inside of Red Robin restaurants. Through this partnership, our restaurants will prepare and serve Donatos® branded pizzas to our dine in and off-premise Guests. Pursuant to a licensing arrangement, we will pay royalties on sales of Donatos® pizza products to Donatos®. As of December 27, 2020, we have introduced Donatos® pizzas to 79 restaurants. We plan to introduce Donatos® to approximately 120 restaurants in 2021 and expect to complete our rollout to approximately 400 Company-owned restaurants by 2023.
During 2021, we will continue to execute our long-term growth strategy which includes opportunities to broaden our reach and execute sustainable growth initiatives that deliver value to our stockholders. The Company is expecting to open one new restaurant during 2021. Beyond 2021, we plan to resume investing in restaurant refreshes and remodels that we suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Restaurant Franchise and Licensing Arrangements
As of December 27, 2020, our franchisees operated 103 restaurants in 16 states and British Columbia, Canada. Our two largest franchisees own 43 restaurants located in Michigan, Ohio, and Eastern and Central Pennsylvania. In 2020, we opened one new franchise restaurant. We do not expect our franchisees to open any new restaurants in 2021. 
Franchise Compliance Assurance
We actively work with and monitor our franchisees' performance to help them develop and operate their restaurants in compliance with Red Robin's standards, systems, and procedures. During the restaurant development phase, we review the franchisee's site selection and provide the franchisee with our prototype building plans. We provide trainers to assist the franchisee in opening the restaurant for business. We advise the franchisee on all menu items, management training, and equipment and food purchases. We also exchange best operating practices with our franchisees as we strive to improve our operating systems while attaining a high level of franchisee participation. 
Table of Contents

In response to COVID-19's effect on our franchise operations, we temporarily abated franchise royalty payments and advertising contributions during 2020. During periods of abated payments, franchise revenue was not recognized or collected from our franchisees. Abated royalty payments and advertising contributions will not be collected by the Company. Additionally, we provided assistance to our franchisees to onboard their restaurants onto our online ordering platforms, enabling them to more effectively capture off-premise sales during the pandemic.
Information Technology
We rely on information systems in all aspects of our operations, including, but not limited to, point-of-sale transaction processing in our restaurants, operation of our restaurants, management of our inventories, collection of cash, payment of payroll and other obligations, and various other processes and procedures.
Our restaurant support center and Company-owned restaurants are enabled with information technology and decision support systems. In our restaurants, these systems are designed to provide operational tools for sales, inventory, and labor management. This technology includes industry-specific, off-the-shelf systems such as tools designed to optimize food, beverage, and labor costs. These systems are integrated with our point-of-sale systems to provide daily, weekly, and period-to-date information that is important for managers to run an efficient and effective restaurant. We also use technology to interact with our Guests. This includes our website, loyalty platform, online ordering tools, and Guest feedback systems, which provide actionable insights on Guest service, food quality, and atmosphere to each of our restaurants.
We utilize centralized financial, accounting, and human resource management systems to support our restaurant support center and Company-owned restaurants. In addition, we use an operations scorecard that integrates data from our centralized systems and distributes information to assist in managing our restaurants. We believe these combined tools are important in analyzing and improving our operations, profit margins, and other results.
In 2020, we invested in infrastructure that modernized and upgraded the capacity of our restaurant systems, stabilized the hand-held point-of-sale devices system wide to prepare for the launch of our new Total Guest Experience service model, and continued work on new, Guest facing digital experiences that support in-restaurant and off-premise dining. In 2021, we plan to continue our investments in building innovative digital experiences for our Guests and to improve our ability to manage our technology infrastructure through investments in infrastructure, automation, and advanced monitoring.
We accept electronic payment cards from our Guests for payment in our restaurants. We also receive and maintain certain personal information about our Guests and Team Members. We have systems and processes in place that focus on the protection of our Guests' credit card information and other private information we are required to protect, such as our Team Members' personal information. We have taken a number of steps to prevent the occurrence of security breaches in this respect. Our systems have been carefully designed and configured to protect against data loss or compromise. For example, because of the number of credit card transactions processed in our Company-owned restaurants, Red Robin is required to maintain compliance per the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) for our networks and systems both at our restaurant support center and Company-owned restaurants. Red Robin not only meets the requirements but also maintains a higher-level designation as a Merchant and Service Provider. These PCI compliance standards, set by a consortium of the major credit card companies, require annual assessment to ensure certain levels of system security and procedures are in place to protect our Guests' credit card and other personal information.
We also engage security assessors and consultants to review and advise us on our other data security practices with respect to protection of other sensitive personal information that we obtain from Guests and Team Members.
Marketing and Advertising
We build brand equity and awareness through a media strategy with tailored content by channel and target. We leverage digital media (including search, website, paid digital, over-the-top, online video, and social media), email, SMS, and public relations initiatives. These programs are funded primarily through cooperative creative development and national media advertising funds. In addition, we supplement national media with targeted local media across offline and online channels.
In recent years, we have undertaken significant market research initiatives to gain a deep understanding of our Guests, our brand promise, and what we must do to deliver that promise. Additionally, we gain feedback and perceptions in order to inform our business decisions. Among other things, we use a Guest satisfaction tool in all restaurants that provides feedback from Guests on their experiences. Restaurant managers use this information to help identify areas of focus to strengthen restaurant performance and track progress. We also continually monitor our performance relative to peers and test potential business drivers among both current and potential Guests. We leverage our over nine million member Red Robin RoyaltyTM database to gain insights and track the frequency and purchase behavior of our Guests.

Our "All the Fulls" brand campaign, which highlights our distinctive positioning and emotional connection with Guests, will feature new creative content in 2021. We will also continue marketing support for our growing off-premise business which includes carryout, catering, and delivery. In 2020, we began increasing our focus on digital marketing, which has proven effective in reaching our core Guests where and how they consume media, and more cost effectively. This digital marketing strategy has led to increased Guest engagement with our brand.

Competition
The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and our Guests may choose to purchase food at supermarkets or other food retailers. Although, for some occasions, we compete against other segments of the restaurant industry, including quick-service and fast-casual restaurants, our primary competition is with other sit-down, casual dining restaurants within the full service dining segment. In addition, we compete to attract Guests for off-premise dining occasions, including online ordering, delivery, to-go, and catering. The number, size, and strength of competitors vary by region, concept, market, and even restaurant. We compete on the basis of taste, quality, price of food and related Guest value, Guest service, ambiance, location, and overall dining experience.
We believe our Guest demographics, strong brand recognition, gourmet burger concept, family friendly atmosphere, attractive price-value relationship, and the quality of our food and service enable us to differentiate ourselves from our casual dining competitors. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. Our competitors include well-established national chains which have more substantial marketing resources. We also compete with many other restaurant and retail establishments for Team Members.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season due to factors including our retail-oriented locations and family appeal. As a result, our quarterly operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality. Accordingly, results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year, and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease.
Trademarks
We have a number of registered trademarks and service marks, including the Red Robin®, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers®, Red Robin America's Gourmet Burgers & Spirits®, Red Robin Burger Works®, "YUMMM®", Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and BrewsTM, and Red Robin RoyaltyTM names and logos. We have registered or filed applications for trademarks for these marks, among others, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and we have applied to register various trademarks in certain other international jurisdictions. Pursuant to our licensing arrangement with Donatos®, we license the right to use the Donatos® trademark.
In order to better protect our brand, we have also registered the Internet domain name www.redrobin.com. We believe our trademarks, service marks, and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to our brand building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concept.
Government Regulation
Our restaurants are subject to licensing and regulation by state, province, and local health, safety, fire, and other authorities, including licensing requirements, regulations for the sale of alcoholic beverages and food, and public health related indoor capacity restrictions. To date, we have been able to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals. The development and construction of new restaurants is also subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. We are also subject to federal regulation and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our Team Members and affect operating costs. These laws govern minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, meal and rest breaks, unemployment tax rates, health care and benefits, workers' compensation rates, citizenship or residency requirements, child labor regulations, and discriminatory conduct. Federal, state, and local government agencies have established or are in the process of establishing regulations requiring that we disclose to our Guests nutritional information regarding the items we serve.
