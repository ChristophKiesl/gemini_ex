ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 
Photronics, Inc. (and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as "Photronics", the "Company", “we”, or “us”) is one of the world's leading manufacturers of photomasks, which are high precision photographic quartz plates containing microscopic images of electronic circuits. Photomasks are a key element in the manufacture of semiconductors and flat panel displays ("FPDs"), and are used as masters to transfer circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers and flat panel substrates during the fabrication of integrated circuits ("ICs") and a variety of FPDs and, to a lesser extent, other types of electrical and optical components. The Company currently operates principally from nine manufacturing facilities; two of which are located in Europe, three in Taiwan, one in Korea and three in the United States. In August 2016 the Company announced its plans to build a research and development and manufacturing facility in Xiamen, China, with construction commencing in 2017 and production estimated to start in late 2018. See Note 21 for additional information.

Products and Manufacturing Technology
 
The Company manufactures photomasks, which are used as masters to transfer circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers and flat panel substrates. Photomasks are manufactured in accordance with circuit designs provided to us on a confidential basis by our customers. IC and FPD photomask sets are manufactured in layers, each having a distinct pattern which is etched onto a different photomask. The resulting series of photomasks is then used to image the circuit patterns onto each successive layer of a semiconductor wafer or flat panel substrate. The typical manufacturing process for a photomask involves the receipt and conversion of circuit design data to manufacturing pattern data. A lithography system then exposes the circuit pattern onto the photomask blank. The exposed areas are developed and etched to produce that pattern on the photomask. The photomask is then inspected for defects and conformity to the customer's design data. After any defects are repaired, the photomask is cleaned using a proprietary process, any required pellicles (protective translucent cellulose membranes) are applied and, after final inspection, the photomask is shipped to the customer.
 
The Company currently supports customers across the full spectrum of IC production and FPD technologies by manufacturing photomasks using electron beam or optical (laser-based) systems, which are the predominant technologies used for photomask manufacturing, and are capable of producing the finer line resolution, tighter overlay and larger die size for the larger and more complex circuits currently being designed. Electron beam and laser generated photomasks can be used to produce the most advanced semiconductors and FPDs for use in an array of products. However, in the case of IC production, electron beam technologies fabricate the large majority of higher cost critical layer photomasks, while photomasks produced using laser-based systems are less expensive and less precise.  End markets served with IC photomasks include devices used for microprocessors, memory, telecommunications and related applications. The Company currently owns a number of high-end and mature electron beam and laser-based systems.
 
The first several layers of photomasks are sometimes required to be delivered by the Company within 24 hours from the time it receives customers' design data. The ability to manufacture high quality photomasks within short time periods is dependent upon robust processes, efficient manufacturing methods, high production yield, available manufacturing capacity and high equipment reliability. We work to meet these requirements by making significant investments in research and development, capital equipment, manufacturing, and data processing systems, and by utilizing statistical process control methods to optimize the manufacturing process and reduce cycle times.

Quality control is an integral part of the photomask manufacturing process. Photomasks are manufactured in temperature, humidity, and particulate controlled clean rooms because of the high level of precision, quality and manufacturing yield required. Each photomask is inspected several times during the manufacturing process to ensure compliance with customer specifications. The Company continues to make substantial investments in equipment to inspect and repair photomasks to ensure that customer specifications are met.
 
The majority of IC photomasks produced for the semiconductor industry employ geometries of larger than 45 nanometers. At these geometries, the Company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by our competitors that is not also available to the Company. We are also capable of producing full lines of photomasks for high-end IC and FPD applications. In the case of ICs, this includes photomasks at and below the 45 nanometer technology node and, for FPDs, at and above the Generation 8 technology node and active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) display screens. The Company holds customer qualified manufacturing capability and owns, or has access to, technology that enables it to compete in the high-end markets that serve IC and FPD applications.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
The market for photomasks primarily consists of domestic and international semiconductor and FPD manufacturers and designers. Photomasks are manufactured by independent merchant manufacturers like Photronics, and by semiconductor and FPD manufacturers that produce photomasks for their own use (captive manufacturers). In some instances, captive manufacturers also sell to other semiconductor or FPD manufacturers. Previously there was a trend towards the divesture or closing of captive photomask operations by semiconductor manufacturers and an increase in the share of the market served by independent manufacturers. This trend was driven by the increased complexity and cost of capital equipment used in manufacturing photomasks and the lack of economy of scale for many semiconductor and FPD manufacturers to effectively utilize the equipment.  However, more recently the remaining and largest captive mask facilities have started investing at faster rates than independent manufacturers to reach certain roadmap milestones, particularly in the foundry logic and memory spaces.  Nevertheless, most captive manufacturers maintain business and technology relationships with independent photomask manufacturers for ongoing support.
 
Generally, the Company and each of its customers engage in a qualification and correlation process before the Company becomes an approved supplier. Thereafter, the Company typically negotiates pricing parameters for a customer's orders based on the customer's specifications. Some prices may remain in effect for an extended period of time. In some instances, the Company enters into sales arrangements with an understanding that, as long as our performance is competitive, we will receive a specified percentage of that customer's photomask requirements. However, none of our customers have entered into significant long-term agreements with us that require them to purchase our products.
 
We conduct our sales and marketing activities primarily through a staff of full-time sales personnel and customer service representatives who work closely with the Company's management and technical personnel. The Company supports international customers through both its domestic and international facilities. We consider our presence in international markets to be an important factor in attracting new customers, as it provides global solutions to our customers, minimizes delivery time, and allows us to serve customers that utilize manufacturing foundries outside of the United States, principally in Asia. See Note 15 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the amount of net sales and long-lived assets attributable to each of the Company's geographic areas of operations.

Customers
 
The Company primarily sells its products to leading semiconductor and FPD manufacturers. The Company's largest customers (listed alphabetically) during the fiscal year ended October 30, 2016, ("fiscal 2016") included the following:

AU Optronics Corp. | MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation
-------------------------+------------------------------------
Dongbu HiTek Co., Ltd. | Micron Technology, Inc. 
Epcos AG | Nanya Technology Corporation 
Global Foundries, Inc. | ON Semiconductor Corporation 
Himax Display, Inc. | Powerchip Technology Corporation 
Infineon Technologies AG | Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. 
Innolux Corporation | STMicroelectronics N.V. 
Inotera Memories, Inc. | Texas Instruments, Incorporated 
Intel Corporation | Tower Semiconductor, Ltd. 
LG Display Co., Ltd | United Microelectronics Corp. 

 
During fiscal 2016, the Company sold its products and services to approximately 600 customers. Sales to one customer accounted for approximately 19%, 18% and 16% of the Company’s total net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and sales to another customer accounted for approximately 17%, 15% and 11% of the Company’s total net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our five largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 50%, 52% and 44% of net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. A significant decrease in the amount of sales to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the financial performance and business prospects of the Company.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company's quarterly revenues can be affected by the seasonal purchasing of its customers. We are typically impacted during our first quarter by the North American and European holiday periods, as some customers reduce their effective workdays and orders during this period. Additionally, the Company can be impacted during its first or second fiscal quarter by the Asian New Year holiday period, which also may reduce customer orders.
Research and Development
 
The Company conducts research and development activities for IC photomasks at its U.S. nanoFab, which is located in Boise, Idaho, as well as at PK, Ltd. (“PKL”), its subsidiary in Korea and Photronics DNP Mask Corporation (“PDMC”), one of its subsidiaries in Taiwan. Research and development for FPD photomasks is conducted at PKL. Additionally, the Company conducts site-specific research and development programs to support strategic customers. These research and development programs and activities are undertaken to advance the Company's competitiveness in technology and manufacturing efficiency. We also conduct application oriented research and development activities to support the early adoption of new photomask or supporting data and services technology into our customers' applications. Currently, research and development photomask activities for ICs are focused on 20 nanometer node and below and, for FPDs, on Generation 8 resolution enhancement, substrates larger than Generation 8 and more complex masks for AMOLED type displays. The Company believes these core competencies will continue to be a critical part of semiconductor and FPD manufacturing, as optical lithography continues to scale capabilities on high-end devices. We incurred research and development expenses of $21.7 million in fiscal year 2016, and $21.9 million in fiscal years 2015 and 2014. The Company believes that it owns, controls, or licenses valuable proprietary information that is necessary for its business as it is presently conducted. This includes trade secrets as well as patents. We also believe that our intellectual property and trade secret know-how will continue to be important to our maintaining technical leadership in the field of photomasks.
 
On May 5, 2016, the Company sold its investment in MP Mask to Micron for $93.1 million and recorded a gain on the sale of $0.1 million, which is included in the Company’s 2016 condensed consolidated statements of income in Interest and other income (expense), net.  On that same date, a supply agreement commenced between the Company and Micron, which provides that the Company will be the majority outsourced supplier of Micron’s photomasks and related services. The supply agreement has a one year term, subject to mutually agreeable renewals. In addition, the Company forevermore has the rights to use the technology it acquired under its prior technology license agreement.

Patents and Trademarks
 
The Company has ownership interests in approximately 40 issued U.S. patents. The subject matter of these patents, which are registered in various countries, generally relates to the manufacture of IC photomasks or the use of photomasks to manufacture other products. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2018 to 2034. The Company also has a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries.
 
While the Company believes that its intellectual property is, and will continue to be, important to its technical leadership in the field of photomasks, its operations are not dependent on any one individual patent. The Company protects its intellectual property rights and proprietary processes by utilizing patents and non-disclosure agreements with employees, customers and vendors.
 
Materials, Supplies and Equipment
 
Raw materials used by the Company generally include: high precision quartz plates (including large area plates), which are used as photomask blanks and are primarily obtained from Japanese and Korean suppliers; pellicles and electronic grade chemicals, which are used in the manufacturing process; and compacts, which are durable plastic containers in which photomasks are shipped. These materials are generally sourced from several suppliers. The Company believes that its utilization of a select group of strategic suppliers enables it to access the most technologically advanced materials available. On an ongoing basis, the Company continues to consider additional supply sources.
 
The Company relies on a limited number of equipment suppliers to develop and supply the equipment used in the photomask manufacturing process. Although the Company has been able to obtain equipment on a timely basis, an inability to obtain equipment when required could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.
 
Backlog
 
The first several layers of a set of photomasks for a circuit pattern are often required to be shipped within 24 hours of receiving a customer's designs. Because of the short period between order and shipment dates (typically from 1 day to 2 weeks) for a significant amount of the Company's sales, the dollar amount of our current backlog is not considered to be a reliable indicator of future sales volume.
International Operations
 
Sales from the Company’s non-U.S. operations were approximately 76%, 75% and 77% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe that our ability to serve international markets is enhanced by our having, among other things, a local presence in the markets that we serve. This requires significant investments in financial, managerial, operational, and other resources.
 
Operations outside of the United States are subject to inherent risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, political and economic conditions in various countries, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, longer accounts receivable collection cycles, potential restrictions on transfers of funds and potentially adverse tax consequences. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to generate sales outside of the United States and to deploy resources where they could otherwise be used to their greatest advantage and, consequently, may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. Note 15 of the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements present net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area.
 
Competition
 
The photomask industry is highly competitive and most of the Company's customers utilize multiple photomask suppliers. The Company's ability to compete depends primarily upon the consistency of its products’ quality, timeliness of delivery, as well as pricing, technical capability and service, which we believe are the principal factors considered by customers in selecting their photomask suppliers. An inability to meet these requirements could adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company also believes that proximity to customers is an important factor in certain markets where cycle time from order to delivery is critical. While some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing or other resources than the Company, we believe that we are able to compete effectively because of our dedication to customer service, investments in state-of-the-art photomask equipment and facilities, and experienced technical employees.

The Company estimates that, for the types of photomasks it manufactures (IC and FPD), the size of the total market (captive and merchant) is approximately $4.0 billion. Its competitors include Compugraphics International, Ltd., Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd (outside of Taiwan), Hoya Corporation, SK-Electronics Co. Ltd., Taiwan Mask Corporation and Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. The Company also competes with semiconductor manufacturers' captive photomask manufacturing operations that supply photomasks for internal use and, in some instances, also for external customers and foundries. The Company expects to face continued competition which, in the past, has led to pressure to reduce prices. The Company believes the pressure to reduce prices, coupled with the significant investment required in capital equipment to manufacture high-end photomasks, has contributed to the decrease in the number of independent manufacturers, and we expect such pressure to continue in the future.
 
Employees
 
As of October 30, 2016, the Company had 1,530 employees. The Company believes it offers competitive compensation and other benefits and that its employee relations are good.
