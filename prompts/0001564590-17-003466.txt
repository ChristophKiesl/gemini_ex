Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering novel therapeutics for patients based on hypoxia-inducible factor, or HIF, biology, and building our pipeline while leveraging our development and commercial expertise in renal disease. HIF is the primary regulator of the production of red blood cells, or RBCs, in the body, as well as other important metabolic functions.  Pharmacologic modulation of the HIF pathway may have broad therapeutic applications. Our lead product candidate, vadadustat, is an oral therapy in Phase 3 development, which has the potential to set a new standard of care in the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our management team has extensive experience in developing and commercializing drugs for the treatment of renal and metabolic disorders, as well as a deep understanding of HIF biology. This unique combination of HIF and renal expertise is enabling us to advance a pipeline of HIF-based therapies to address serious diseases.
 HIF, a pathway involving hundreds of genes, is responsible for orchestrating the body’s natural response to lower levels of oxygen, or hypoxia. In response to hypoxia, a coordinated adaptive response occurs resulting in both an increase in red blood cell production, a normal biological process known as erythropoiesis, and enhancement of the delivery of iron to the bone marrow to support erythropoiesis. The significance of the HIF pathway was recognized by the 2016 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award, which honored the three physician-scientists who discovered the HIF pathway and elucidated this primary oxygen sensing mechanism that is essential for survival. HIF protein is constantly being produced under normal oxygen conditions, but is quickly degraded by prolyl hydroxylases, or PH.  Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-PH’s are inhibited, allowing HIF to stimulate erythropoiesis.  These findings have opened up new possibilities for developing therapeutics, such as HIF-PHI, which have the potential to treat many diseases. 
 Our lead product candidate, vadadustat, a HIF-PH inhibitor in Phase 3 development for the treatment of anemia of CKD. Anemia is a serious medical condition in which blood is deficient in hemoglobin, which is critical for delivering oxygen to organs and tissue. Untreated anemia is associated with chronic fatigue, increased risk of progression of multiple diseases and death. Anemia is common in patients with CKD, cancer, heart failure, inflammatory diseases and other critical illnesses.
 More than 30 million people in the United States have CKD, with estimates that over 1.8 million of these patients suffer from anemia. Anemia from CKD is currently treated by injectable recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or rESAs, such as EPOGEN® and Aranesp®, as well as with iron supplementation or red blood cell transfusion. Based on the reported revenues of companies that market and sell rESAs, global sales of injectable rESAs were estimated to be between $6.5 and $7.0 billion in 2015. The vast majority of these sales were for the treatment of anemia associated with renal disease.
 rESAs deliver supra-physiological levels of exogenous erythropoietin, or EPO, to stimulate production of RBCs. While injectable rESAs may be effective in raising hemoglobin levels, they carry significant potential side effects, and need to be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) or into a vein (intravenously). In particular, injectable rESAs may lead to thrombosis, stroke, myocardial infarction and death. These safety concerns, which became evident starting in 2006, have led to a significant reduction in the use of injectable rESAs. Today, anemia is either not treated or inadequately treated in the majority of non-dialysis dependent (NDD) CKD patients. We believe that novel treatment options that address these concerns are needed and would have significant market potential. Because it mimics the body’s natural adaptive response to hypoxia, vadadustat’s HIF-PH inhibition may raise hemoglobin levels without causing supra-physiological levels of EPO. 
 Vadadustat has the potential to set a new standard of care for the treatment of anemia in CKD. Early clinical studies of vadadustat demonstrated that diurnal variation of EPO was maintained resulting in predictable increases in hemoglobin in normal human volunteers and similar results were seen in NDD-CKD. These data led us to the design of our Phase 3 clinical program. The vadadustat Phase 3 program in NDD-CKD patients with anemia, called PRO2TECT, and in dialysis dependent (DD) CKD patients with anemia, called INNO2VATE, is designed to enroll approximately 5,700 patients evaluating once daily oral dosing of vadadustat against an rESA active comparator, darbepoetin alfa. The enrollment numbers and the completion of the Phase 3 program will be driven by the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE. In December 2015 the first patient was dosed in PRO2TECT, and the first patient was dosed in INNO2VATE in August 2016. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in the second half of 2017 to evaluate three-times weekly dosing of vadadustat in approximately 300 DD-CKD patients receiving hemodialysis using the same active comparator, darbepoetin alfa. We currently anticipate submitting marketing applications for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD in the United States and Europe in 2019. 
 If vadadustat is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we plan to establish our own commercial organization in the United States while leveraging our collaboration with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., or Otsuka, and its well-established commercial organization. In Japan and other countries in Asia, we plan to commercialize vadadustat through our 
 3


collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, or MTPC, and intend to seek one or more collaborators to commercialize vadadustat in Europe and other markets. 
In addition to vadadustat, we are developing a HIF-based portfolio of product candidates that target serious diseases of high unmet need. Our portfolio includes product candidates developed internally, such as AKB-6899, as well as in-licensed product candidates, such as AKB-5169. AKB-6899 has demonstrated a robust hemoglobin response in early preclinical studies, and we plan to further investigate its potential in multiple preclinical models of anemia and assess next steps based on these data. In February 2017, we signed an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, or Janssen, for access to an extensive library of well-characterized HIF pathway compounds with potential applications across multiple therapeutic areas.  The lead compound, AKB-5169, is a differentiated preclinical compound in development as an oral treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and we intend to complete further preclinical development with the goal of an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA in 2018. 
 Our Product Pipeline

Anemia Overview
 
Anemia is a term used to describe a decrease in RBCs. RBCs contain a protein called hemoglobin that is responsible for moving oxygen throughout the body. As a result, anemia is measured by the level of hemoglobin in the blood. Patients with CKD often have anemia because the kidneys do not make enough EPO, which stimulates the body to make RBCs. Less EPO causes the body to make fewer RBCs and hemoglobin, decreasing the supply of oxygen throughout the body. Anemia is a serious medical condition that exists when hemoglobin drops below 13 g/dL in men and 12 g/dL in women and, if left untreated, is associated with chronic fatigue, increased risk of progression of multiple diseases and death. Successful treatment of anemia significantly improves patients’ quality of life and is associated with decreased cardiovascular morbidity, less frequent hospitalizations and lower mortality risk.

Chronic Kidney Disease 
 CKD, a common cause of anemia, is a condition in which the kidneys are progressively damaged to the point that they cannot properly filter the blood circulating in the body. This damage causes waste products to build up in the patient’s blood leading to other health problems, including anemia, cardiovascular disease and bone disease. CKD patients are classified by the degree of their loss of kidney function as measured by the glomerular filtration rate, or GFR, and the level of protein in the urine, referred to as albuminuria. As illustrated in the table below, CKD affects more than 30 million people in the United States, and the prevalence of anemia increases with the severity of CKD. 
 

There are many causes of CKD, including diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The prevalence and incidence of CKD is increasing in all segments of the United States population, particularly in patients over 65. Risk factors for the development of CKD include concomitant diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease), lifestyle factors (tobacco use and inactivity), family history, aging and prenatal factors (maternal diabetes mellitus, low birth weight and small-for-gestational-age status). According to a Lancet article published in May 2013, projected worldwide population changes suggest that the potential number of cases of CKD, specifically end-stage, will increase disproportionately in countries, such as Japan, China and India, where the numbers of elderly people are increasing. This effect will be enhanced further if the growth in the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes persists along with the associated increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease and access to treatment does not improve. 
 
Current Treatments Leave a Substantial Unmet Need

Injectable rESAs are currently the standard of care for treating anemia in patients with CKD and must be administered intravenously or subcutaneously along with iron supplements. In 2006, data on the risks of rESA use among these patients became available, forcing physicians to balance serious safety concerns against the efficacy of rESAs. The well-documented safety concerns1 associated with the

use of injectable rESAs include increased cardiovascular risk, and the potential for increased rate of tumor progression in patients with cancer. 
 
As a result of the safety concerns related to rESA use, patients live with lower hemoglobin levels, higher rates of RBC transfusions, and receive more intravenous iron, or IV iron, to treat anemia associated with CKD. The increased use of IV iron and RBC transfusions, also subject patients to safety risks related to these alternative treatments to injectable rESAs. The risks of RBC transfusions include the development of antibodies to foreign antigens, which may negatively impact candidacy for kidney transplantation, the potential transmission of blood-borne pathogens and iron overload with chronic transfusions. The risks of IV iron use include hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal anaphylactic-type reactions. 
 
The graph below, based on a post hoc analysis of the Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency, or CHOIR, study suggests that patients achieving higher hemoglobin levels with lower injectable rESA doses had better outcomes than patients receiving higher injectable rESA doses despite lower achieved hemoglobin levels. Therefore, higher injectable rESA doses, not the achieved hemoglobin level, appeared to be most strongly correlated with adverse outcomes.
 
Vadadustat Has the Potential to Set a New Standard of Care 
 We believe that, based on the HIF-PH inhibition mechanism of action and clinical data to date, vadadustat has the potential to set a new standard of care for the treatment of anemia secondary to CKD. Below is a summary of the clinical findings and further details are included under the “Vadadustat Clinical Development Overview” section below.

• | Vadadustat maintained a normal diurnal variation of EPO. In studies in healthy volunteers and CKD patients, vadadustat acted by simulating the body’s natural response to hypoxia and maintained a normal diurnal variation in EPO without causing supra-physiological levels of EPO.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vadadustat significantly increased and maintained hemoglobin levels. Our Phase 2 studies in CKD patients with anemia demonstrated that vadadustat significantly increased and/or maintained hemoglobin levels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Vadadustat has been studied as a once-daily or three times weekly oral dose. Phase 2 studies have shown that vadadustat can be orally dosed once daily in NDD-CKD patients over 20 weeks of dosing. In addition, a Phase 2 clinical study in DD-CKD patients demonstrated once daily or three times weekly oral dosing of vadadustat maintained stable hemoglobin levels in patients converting from ESA therapy over 16 weeks.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vadadustat improved mobilization of iron supply to the bone marrow for RBC production. In Phase 2 clinical studies, vadadustat demonstrated favorable changes in iron parameters (e.g. decrease in hepcidin and ferritin and increase in total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation) consistent with improved iron mobilization to the bone marrow to support erythropoiesis in NDD-CKD and DD-CKD patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For the above reasons, we believe that vadadustat has the potential to demonstrate a reduced risk of cardiovascular (CV) and thrombotic events compared to injectable rESAs. These CV risks have been associated with supra-physiologic increases in EPO levels and excessive hemoglobin fluctuations and/or excursions beyond the target range. The incidence of CV adverse events associated with vadadustat as compared with darbepoetin alfa, an injectable rESA, is being assessed in the global Phase 3 program. 
 HIF-PH Inhibition: A Different Mechanism of Action That Mimics the Body’s Natural Physiologic Response to Hypoxia 
 Vadadustat is designed to work by a mechanism of action that differs from injectable rESAs. This mechanism of action is referred to as HIF-PH inhibition. HIF is the primary regulator of the production of RBCs and acts by simulating the body’s natural response to lower levels of oxygen, or hypoxia. In response to hypoxia, a coordinated adaptive response occurs resulting in both an increase in RBC production and enhancement of the delivery of iron to the bone marrow, ensuring the incorporation of iron into hemoglobin necessary for new RBC production. This is very similar to the body’s natural adaptive response that is induced when a person ascends in altitude. At higher altitudes, lower levels of oxygen circulating in the blood stream lead to reduction in HIF-PH activity, which increases intracellular levels of HIFa proteins.  
 When stabilized, HIFa travels to the nucleus of the cell, where it binds to the protein HIFß. When bound together, they induce the production of EPO and iron transfer proteins. With continued stabilization of HIFa (either by staying at higher altitude or by the administration of a HIF-PH inhibitor), the level of hemoglobin and RBCs will rise in order to increase the amount of oxygen circulating in the blood. 
 Vadadustat Clinical Development Overview
 
In the 15 studies of vadadustat completed to date, the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vadadustat have been demonstrated:
  
• | nine completed Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers (CI‑0001, CI‑0002, CI‑0006, CI‑0008, CI‑0010, CI‑0012, CI‑0013, CI-0019, and CI-0020);

The results from three of these key early studies are summarized below.
 Vadadustat Clinical Development Summary
Vadadustat has been shown to maintain the normal diurnal variation in EPO levels without causing supra-physiological levels of EPO, while achieving the desired outcomes of raising and maintaining hemoglobin, and increasing iron mobilization to support erythropoiesis. Vadadustats safety profile has been consistent across Phase 1 and 2 studies completed to date. AEs identified as causally associated with vadadustat include mild to moderate nausea and diarrhea, as well as laboratory increases in uric acid levels not resulting in any further AEs.

Phase 1 Study in Normal Healthy Male Volunteers (CI-0002)
 
We have completed a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics response, and pharmacokinetics of vadadustat administered for 10 days to healthy male volunteers.  Dose responsive increases in reticulocytes, or immature RBCs, and hemoglobin levels were demonstrated in the study.  EPO levels increased by 36%, 48%, 48%, and 110% over baseline in the placebo, 500 mg/day, 700 mg/day, and 900 mg/day at 16 hours after dosing and returned to baseline by 24 hours following each dose. The frequency of adverse events (AEs) was balanced between the combined vadadustat dosing groups (76%) and the placebo group (78%), and across vadadustat dosing cohorts.  Gastrointestinal AEs occurred in 36% of subjects in the vadadustat groups and in no subjects on placebo, of which mild to moderate diarrhea was the most frequent (24%), but without a discernible dose related effect observed.  No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in this study.
 Phase 2b Study in Non-Dialysis CKD Patients (CI-0007) 
 We completed a multi-center Phase 2b study of vadadustat in subjects with anemia secondary to NDD-CKD. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of vadadustat over 20 weeks of dosing in 210 subjects (138 vadadustat and 72 placebo) with CKD categories G3-G5. Subjects were enrolled into one of three groups: (1) ESA naïve with hemoglobin ≤10.5 g/dL, (2) previously treated with ESA with hemoglobin ≤10.5 g/dL, or (3) actively treated with ESA with hemoglobin ≥9.5 and ≤12.0 g/dL, and were randomized (2:1) to once daily vadadustat or placebo. The primary endpoint was the percent of subjects with either a mean hemoglobin of ≥11.0 g/dL or an increase in hemoglobin by ≥1.2 g/dL from baseline. A protocol-defined dose adjustment algorithm was used to achieve the primary endpoint and to minimize hemoglobin excursions ≥13 g/dL. 
 The average age was 66 years, ~75% of subjects had diabetes mellitus and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, was 25 mL/min/1.73m2. 54.9% of vadadustat treated subjects compared to 10.3% of placebo treated subjects met the primary endpoint (p=0.0001). Only 4.3% of subjects in the vadadustat group had any hemoglobin excursion ≥13.0 g/dL. Group 3 placebo treated subjects experienced a decline in the mean hemoglobin within the first 2 weeks, whereas subjects randomized to vadadustat maintained a stable hemoglobin throughout the study. Increases in hemoglobin in the vadadustat group were associated with an increase in reticulocytes and total iron binding capacity, TIBC, and a decrease in serum hepcidin and ferritin. There was no difference between the vadadustat and placebo groups in vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, levels during the study.  
 A similar percentage of subjects experienced AEs in the vadadustat and placebo treatment groups (74.6% vs. 73.6%). There was an increase in renal related SAEs reported in the vadadustat-treated subjects (vadadustat 9.4% vs. placebo 2.8%); however, the number of subjects requiring dialysis, an objective measure of the severity of renal disease, was similar in the two treatment groups (vadadustat 8.0% vs. placebo 9.7%). Overall AEs for renal and urinary disorders was balanced (vadadustat 14.5% vs. placebo 13.9%). The disparity in renal SAEs was likely related to variability in reporting between investigators (reasons included proceeding to dialysis in association with a SAE that was not reported in the renal category, or proceeding to dialysis without being considered an SAE). Other differences in AEs, favoring either vadadustat or placebo, were as follows: nausea and diarrhea (vadadustat 10.1% vs. placebo 4.2%); gastrointestinal hemorrhage (vadadustat 0.0% vs. placebo 5.6%); upper respiratory tract infection (vadadustat 1.4% vs. placebo 6.9%); hyperkalemia (vadadustat 5.1% vs. placebo 0.0%); and hypertension (vadadustat 8.0% vs. placebo 2.8%). There were three deaths in vadadustat-treated subjects (two were considered to be unrelated to vadadustat and one was considered by the investigator to be possibly related because no autopsy was performed to rule out relatedness) and there were no deaths in the placebo group. 
 In summary, vadadustat achieved the desired outcomes of raising and maintaining hemoglobin and increasing iron mobilization, while minimizing hemoglobin excursions ≥13 g/dL. Pergola et al published the results of this study in Kidney International 2016. 
 Phase 2 Study in Dialysis-Dependent CKD Patients (CI-0011) 
 We have completed a multi-center, open-label, 16-week study to assess the hemoglobin response, safety, and tolerability of vadadustat in DD-CKD subjects. The study enrolled 94 hemodialysis subjects (hemoglobin 9-12 g/dL), who were maintained on ESAs prior to study entry. Subjects were converted from ESA to vadadustat, and assigned to 1 of 3 dose cohorts: 300 mg once daily (QD); 450 mg QD; or 450 mg three times weekly (TIW). For each dose cohort, the mean or average hemoglobin level at study entry was compared to the average hemoglobin level at weeks 7 and 8, and to the average hemoglobin level at weeks 15 and 16. To evaluate hemoglobin response to each of the dose regimens, during the first eight weeks of this study subjects were to remain on the prescribed starting dose, or decreased if necessary to control hemoglobin in the target range. Beginning at week eight, the dose of vadadustat could be increased or decreased to maintain hemoglobin levels as needed. Intravenous iron use was allowed. 
 The underlying patient demographics and profile of these CKD patients were well-balanced across the three cohorts, and reflective of the United States DD-CKD population as reported in the literature. Average age was 58 years, with an average time on dialysis of 4.6 years. The most common cause of end-stage renal disease was diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension. Baseline hemoglobin levels were 
 8


similar (10.4-10.6 g/dL) in all three cohorts and the serum ferritin levels indicated that the subjects were iron replete at study entry and throughout the study.
 The study achieved its primary endpoint of maintaining stable hemoglobin levels over 16 weeks, across all three cohorts of subjects converting from ESAs to vadadustat. The study supports both daily and three times weekly vadadustat dosing regimens as viable options. Consistent with previous studies, all three starting dose regimens suggested an improvement in iron mobilization, as reflected by increases in total iron binding capacity and serum iron, and decreases in serum ferritin and hepcidin levels. Only one subject in the 300 mg once daily cohort had a single hemoglobin excursion to 13.1 g/dL. 
 
 
Mean Hemoglobin Levels (g/dL)* | Baseline | Week 7/8 | Week 15/16
300mg Daily Dose | 10.4 | 10.4 | 10.3 
450mg Daily Dose | 10.6 | 10.3 | 10.5 
450mg Three Times per Week Dose | 10.5 | 10.2 | 10.4 
*Modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population, n=94

 
Adverse events were balanced across the three cohorts. There were no discernible trends in the frequency of AEs or SAEs by dose cohort. SAEs were reported in 13 subjects (13.8%); no SAEs were reported as related to vadadustat and no deaths occurred during the study. 
 The results of this study demonstrate that vadadustat maintained hemoglobin levels in DD-CKD subjects who were converted from existing ESA therapy to vadadustat. Only one subject had a single hemoglobin excursion to a level of 13.1 g/dL. The frequency and type of SAEs were consistent with those expected in a DD-CKD population. The results of this study were reported at the American Society of Nephrology meeting in November 2015 and the National Kidney Foundation Spring Clinical Meeting in April 2016.
 Phase 3 Global Program 
 We are conducting two global Phase 3 studies to support an indication for the treatment of anemia in NDD-CKD patients and three global Phase 3 studies to support an indication for the treatment of anemia in DD-CKD patients:

---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In both the PRO2TECT and INNO2VATE Phase 3 programs, the primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change in hemoglobin between baseline (mean pretreatment hemoglobin) and the primary evaluation period, concluding non-inferiority (NI) when the upper 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio (vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa) does not exceed the NI margin. Both the PRO2TECT and INNO2VATE programs will include the primary safety endpoint of the assessment of major adverse cardiovascular endpoints, or MACE, with a comparison of vadadustat to darbepoetin alfa. MACE is defined as the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. To assess MACE, a pooled analysis of time to first MACE event from the two Phase 3 studies in each program will be performed, concluding NI when the upper 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio (vadadustat/darbepoetin alfa) does not exceed the NI margin. We obtained feedback from the United States and European regulatory authorities regarding the design of these programs.
 9


Overall, the PRO2TECT and INNO2VATE Phase 3 programs are designed to enroll approximately 5,700 CKD patients. We have engaged Quintiles IMS as our primary clinical contract research organization, or CRO, for the PRO2TECT and INNO2VATE programs. We expect the cost of the PRO2TECT and INNO2VATE programs to be in the range of $80,000 to $85,000 per patient, aggregating in the range of $456.0 million to $484.5 million in external CRO costs for the total program. Such estimated costs could increase significantly if the Phase 3 program takes longer to complete or if we choose to add additional investigative sites, add additional patients, modify the clinical trial protocol, or perform other studies in support of the Phase 3 program.
 Based on a Phase 2 study (CI-0011), which demonstrated that vadadustat administered once-daily or three-times weekly maintained hemoglobin levels in hemodialysis subjects who were converted from existing ESA therapy, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 study of three-times weekly dosing. This study will enroll approximately 300 DD-CKD patients receiving hemodialysis and will begin in the second half of 2017, and expect to have topline clinical data in 2018. Patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis typically receive their treatments three-times weekly and the flexibility of administering vadadustat three-times weekly on the day of their dialysis session would be desirable. Furthermore, we have shown that the hemodialysis procedure does not have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of vadadustat or its metabolites, indicating that vadadustat can be administered irrespective of the timing of the dialysis session (CI-0009).
 Additional Studies 
 We have completed a thorough QT, or TQT, study in accordance with FDA guidance and confirmed that vadadustat does not alter cardiac repolarization intervals in healthy volunteers following a single dose of up to 1200 mg. In addition, we completed a drug-drug interaction study that demonstrated there is no impact of vadadustat on the metabolism of any of the major statins, which are commonly prescribed for CKD patients. 
 We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in DD-CKD patients who do not have an adequate hemoglobin response despite receiving high doses of rESAs. This represents approximately 10-15% of DD-CKD patients. Previous studies have shown that rESA hyporesponsiveness is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including increased mortality risk. By increasing iron mobilization, in addition to erythropoietin levels, vadadustat may allow for a more consistent hemoglobin response in these patients. We plan to initiate the rESA hyporesponder study in the second half of 2017, and expect to have clinical data in 2018.
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 Vadadustat is a small molecule that is manufactured from readily available commercial starting materials. We have no internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce all lots of drug substance and drug products. 
 We have a Master Services Agreement with Evonik Corporation, or Evonik, pursuant to which Evonik develops and manufactures vadadustat drug substance for use in our Phase 3 development program and in other clinical trials. Evonik is currently manufacturing vadadustat at commercially-relevant scale. We also have a Master Services Agreement with Esteve Quimica, or Esteve, to manufacture vadadustat for clinical trial use.
 The drug substance can be readily formulated into compressed tablets with pharmacopeial excipients using common manufacturing processes. We have a Master Services Agreement with UPM, pursuant to which UPM further develops and manufactures the drug product for use in our Phase 3 global program for vadadustat and other clinical trials. UPM is currently manufacturing vadadustat tablets at commercially‑relevant scale.
 In our agreements with third-party manufacturers, we retain ownership of our intellectual property and generally own and/or are licensed rights to processes, developments, data, results and other intellectual property relating to our products and generated during the course of the manufacturer’s performance under the agreement. We retain the right to source drug substance and drug product from multiple suppliers.
 Strategic Collaborations
 Collaboration with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.
 On December 18, 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Otsuka, pursuant to which we agreed to co-exclusively collaborate with Otsuka with respect to the development and commercialization of vadadustat in the United States. Under the Agreement, the parties will co-exclusively commercialize vadadustat in the United States, subject to approval of vadadustat by the FDA. We will continue to lead the ongoing global Phase 3 development program for vadadustat.
 Under the terms of the agreement, Otsuka paid us an upfront payment of $125.0 million and are committed to provide additional funding of $140.0 million or more toward the vadadustat global development program. In addition, if the development costs exceed a certain threshold, we may require Otsuka to pay a higher percentage of the global development costs. In such event, Otsuka would be

reimbursed for such additional funding out of milestone payments and net sales of vadadustat in the United States. In addition, we are eligible to receive from Otsuka up to $765.0 million in specified development and commercial milestones.
 The agreement establishes a profit share for the commercialization of vadadustat in the United States. Under the agreement, the parties will equally share all net sales of vadadustat in the United States, and each party will bear half of all costs in the United States (including medical affairs, commercialization and manufacturing costs).
 Collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation
 On December 11, 2015, we and MTPC entered into a collaboration agreement providing MTPC with exclusive development and commercialization rights to vadadustat in Japan and certain other Asian countries. 
 In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the agreement, MTPC will make payments totaling up to $100.0 million to fund the vadadustat global Phase 3 program, including $40.0 million paid in 2016. To the extent Japanese patients are included in the Phase 3 Program, MTPC will fund up to an additional $60.0 million of development costs. If Japanese patients are not included in the Phase 3 Program, MTPC will be responsible for the costs of the local Phase 3 study in Japan and will make no additional funding payments for the Phase 3 Program, and $20.0 million of the $40.0 million we received in 2016 would be used to fund local development of vadadustat in Japan or be refunded to MTPC, at MTPC’s discretion. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to approximately $250.0 million in additional milestone payments, based upon achievement of certain development and sales milestones. MTPC also agreed to make tiered royalty payments, from low teens up to twenty percent, on sales of vadadustat in the territory.
Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we may benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe and other countries that provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying molecules. See “—Regulatory Matters.” 
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection of our current and future product candidates, methods of their use and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. Even once patents successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability, inventorship, or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 Our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes 109 allowed applications and issued patents and approximately 125 pending utility and provisional patent applications, with pending and issued claims relating to our current clinical stage candidate vadadustat as well as other product candidates, including AKB-6899. We also hold three patents that claim the crystal of a protein-ligand complex comprising a protein-ligand complex of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha prolyl hydroxylase as well as methods for identifying compounds that bind to hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha prolyl hydroxylase. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest international filing date. Patent term recapture for loss of term as a result of the regulatory review period is available in some foreign jurisdictions. Our issued patents and pending applications with respect to our composition of matter, methods of treatment, and pharmaceutical compositions are expected to expire in 2027 or 2028 (depending on eligibility for patent term adjustment) and our pending applications with respect to processes for manufacturing vadadustat, dosing regimens, 
 11


formulations, and various other aspects relating to the treatment of anemia using vadadustat are expected to expire between 2032 and 2034, exclusive of possible patent term adjustments or extensions; however, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 Changes in either the patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below. 
 Vadadustat Patent Portfolio 
 We hold five issued patents and one allowed application covering the composition of matter, method of treating anemia, and pharmaceutical compositions of vadadustat in the United States, one issued patent in Europe (registered in most countries of the European Patent Convention), and additional patents issued or pending in many other major jurisdictions worldwide, including Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Israel and India. The expected expiration date for these composition of matter patents is 2028 plus any extensions or adjustments of term available under national law. 
 In July of 2011, a third party filed an opposition to our issued European Patent No. 2044005 (the ’005 Patent). During the oral proceedings, which took place on April 10, 2013, the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office maintained the ’005 Patent on the basis of the third auxiliary request filed during the oral proceedings. This decision resulted in the maintenance of a claim directed to a compound chosen from a group of eight compounds, including vadadustat, as well as claims to compositions and methods for treating various diseases, including, but not limited to, anemia. Both parties have appealed the decision of the Opposition Division and final resolution of the opposition proceedings will likely take a number of years. We cannot be assured of the breadth of the claims that will remain in the ’005 Patent or that the patent will not be revoked in its entirety. 
 We also hold patents and patent applications directed to processes for manufacturing vadadustat, dosing regimens, formulations, polymorphs, and various other aspects relating to the treatment of anemia using vadadustat that are expected to expire between 2032 and 2034 exclusive of possible patent term extensions. 
 AKB-6899 Patent Portfolio
 We hold four issued patents covering the AKB-6899 composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of treating anemia by administration of AKB-6899, respectively, in the United States, and additional patents issued or pending in many other major jurisdictions worldwide, including Europe, Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and India. The expected expiration date for these composition of matter patents is 2028 plus any extensions or adjustments of term available under national law.

We also hold, either alone or jointly, one issued patent and one pending application covering various methods, including, but not limited to, the treatment of cancer by administration of AKB-6899 in the United States and additional patent applications are issued or pending in many other major jurisdictions worldwide, including Japan, China, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Israel and India. The expected expiration dates for these method of treatment patent applications are expected to be 2032 exclusive of possible patent term extensions or adjustments. We hold one pending patent application in the United States and approximately 13 pending patent applications worldwide directed to treatment or prevention of ocular conditions using AKB-6899, and one pending patent application in the United States and approximately 30 pending patent applications worldwide directed to dosing regimens of AKB-6899. The expected expiration date of this ocular patent application is 2035, and the expected expiration date of this dosing patent application is 2034, exclusive of possible patent term extensions or adjustments. We hold four pending patent applications in various foreign 
 12


jurisdictions and a pending international application directed to polymorphs of AKB-6899. The expected expiration date of this polymorph patent application is 2036 exclusive of possible patent term extensions or adjustments.
 AKB-5169 Patent Portfolio
 There are three issued patents and one pending patent application covering the AKB-5169 composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of treating anemia by administration of AKB-5169, respectively, in the United States, and additional patents issued or pending in many other major jurisdictions worldwide, including Europe, Japan, China, Brazil, Russia and India. The expected expiration date for these composition of matter patents is 2029 plus any extensions or adjustments of term available under national law.
 Know-How 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment provisions in the confidentiality agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment provisions, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by our employees. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. 
 To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Third-Party Filings 
 We are aware of certain United States patents issued to FibroGen, Inc., or FibroGen, directed to, among other things, purportedly new methods of using previously known heterocyclic carboxamide compounds for purposes of treating or affecting specified conditions. We do not believe these currently issued FibroGen United States patents conflict with our intellectual property rights; nor do we make any admission that any of such patents are valid or enforceable. Under United States law, a person may be able to patent a discovery of a new way to use a previously known compound, even if such compound itself is patented, provided, the newly discovered use is novel and non-obvious. Such a method-of-use patent, however, if valid, only protects the use of a claimed compound for the specified methods claimed in the patent. This type of patent does not prevent persons from using the compound for any previously known use of the compound. Further, this type of patent does not prevent persons from making and marketing the compound for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. We are not aware of any valid United States patents issued to FibroGen that claim methods of using any of our product candidates for purposes of inhibiting HIF-PHs for the treatment of anemia secondary to CKD. 
 We have had a number of positive developments in our opposition and invalidity proceedings against FibroGen. With regard to the opposition that we filed in Europe against FibroGen’s European Patent No. 1463823, or the ’823 patent, an oral proceeding took place March 8 and 9, 2016. Following the oral proceeding, the European Opposition Division ruled that the patent as granted did not meet the requirements for patentability under the European Patent Convention and, therefore, revoked the patent in its entirety. FibroGen has appealed that decision. Likewise, with regard to the invalidity proceeding that we filed in Japan against certain claims of FibroGen’s Japanese Patent No. 4804131, or the ’131 patent, which is the Japanese counterpart to the ’823 patent, the Japan Patent Office, or JPO, issued a preliminary decision finding all of the challenged claims to be invalid. FibroGen subsequently amended the claims and the JPO accepted the amendments. The resulting FibroGen Japanese ’131 patent does not cover vadadustat or any pyridine carboxamide compounds. To date, FibroGen has been unsuccessful in its attempts to obtain a patent in the United States covering the same claim scope as it obtained initially in Europe and Japan in the ’823 and ’131 patents. In the event FibroGen were to obtain such a patent in the United States, we may decide to challenge the patent like we have done in Europe and Japan.  
 On May 13, 2015, May 20, 2015 and July 6, 2015 we filed oppositions to FibroGen’s European Patent Nos. 2322153, 2322155, and 163333, or the ’153 patent, the ’155 patent, and the ’333 patent, respectively, requesting the patents be revoked in their entirety. These related patents claim, among other things, various compounds that either stabilize HIFα or inhibit a HIF hydroxylase or a HIF prolyl hydroxylase for treating or preventing various conditions, including, inter alia, iron deficiency, microcytosis associated with iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, anemia wherein the subject has a transferrin saturation of less than 20%, anemia refractory to treatment with exogenously administered erythropoietin, or EPO, and microcytosis in microcytic anemia. Such method of use patents do not prevent persons from using the compound for other uses, including any previously known use of the compound. In particular, these patents do not claim methods of using any of our product candidates for purposes of inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases, or HIF-PHs, for the treatment of anemia secondary to CKD. While we do not believe these patents will prevent us from commercializing vadadustat for treatment of anemia secondary to CKD, we filed these oppositions to provide us and any future partners with maximum flexibility for developing vadadustat and our pipeline of HIF PH inhibitors. With regard to the opposition that 
 13


we filed in Europe against FibroGen’s European Patent No. 163333, or the ’333 patent, an oral proceeding took place December 8 and 9, 2016. Following the oral proceeding, the European Opposition Division ruled that the patent as granted did not meet the requirements for patentability under the European Patent Convention and, therefore, revoked the patent in its entirety. FibroGen has appealed that decision. Oppositions to the ’155 patent and to the ’153 patent were also filed by Glaxo Group Limited, or Glaxo, and by Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH, Bayer Pharma Aktiengesellschaft, and Bayer Animal Health GmbH. While, for the reasons set forth in our oppositions, we believe that the ’153 patent and the ’155 patent should be revoked in their entirety, the ultimate outcomes of the oppositions remains uncertain. 
 Competition 
 If vadadustat is approved and launched commercially, competing drugs may include EPOGEN® and Aranesp®, commercialized by Amgen, Procrit® and Eprex®, commercialized by Johnson & Johnson, and Mircera®, commercialized by Roche Holding Ltd., or Roche. In Europe and other markets biosimilar versions of rESAs are available and may become available in the United States in the future. We may face competition from potential new anemia therapies. There are several other HIF-PHI product candidates in various stages of active development for anemia indications that may be in direct competition with vadadustat if and when they are approved and launched commercially. These candidates are being developed by such companies as FibroGen, in collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC in the United States and China and with Astellas Pharma Inc. in Europe and Asia, Japan Tobacco International, GlaxoSmithKline plc and Bayer HealthCare AG. FibroGen is currently in Phase 3 clinical development of its product candidate, roxadustat, and GlaxoSmithKline plc recently commenced Phase 3 studies of its product candidate, daprodustat. Some of these product candidates may enter the market as early as 2017. 
Regulatory Matters 
 The FDA, and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing, and export and import of drugs. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning or untitled letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, denial of marketing approval, partial or total suspension of production, and/or for approved products, withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, all amendments thereto, and its implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, clinical trial hold or suspension, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or cGLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigation New Drug, or IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee, or EC, before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application or NDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current cGMP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14


 
• | satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or commercial shipment of the drug in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The manufacturing, nonclinical testing, clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. 
 The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol, and other information, are submitted FDA as part of an IND. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for first-in human study (ies). Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. A separate amendment to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol in the United States must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA, if certain requirements are met. Per FDA regulations, the clinical trial must be conducted either: 1) in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki or 2) with the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial. 
 Government Regulation Outside U.S. 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. 
 Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be approved by each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed. Outside of the United States, each clinical trial to be conducted in a given country requires submission and approval of a unique CTA. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union, or EU, regulatory systems, we must submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under Japanese regulatory systems, we must submit a Japanese NDA. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe and Japan, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 
 An approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) is required in Europe prior to submission of the MAA. Ideally, the pediatric studies in both the U.S. Pediatric Study Plan and the EU PIP will be identical, but some differences may be required to meet the respective 
 15


regulatory requirements (e.g., waiver age). The PIP outlines the study designs and timing of the pediatric program. The EMA Paediatric Committee and the FDA’s Office of Pediatric Therapeutics have frequent joint discussions about pediatric drug development, including discussions about specific drugs. Often, these discussions are conducted in an attempt to harmonize pediatric drug development across the two jurisdictions. However, this cannot be guaranteed.
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: Clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: Clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agencies will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4: In some cases, FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post-approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides recommendations for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal testing and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its intended shelf life at the intended storage condition. 
 New Drug Applications 
 The clinical trials, together with the results of nonclinical studies and extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use. 
 16


Once the NDA submission has been accepted for review, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has a goal of responding to standard review NDAs within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, but this timeframe is often extended. The first indication of the FDA’s review progress is provided at the mid-cycle review. This typically occurs five months after the NDA is accepted for review. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 
 Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished drug product, and sometimes the active drug ingredient, is manufactured, and will not approve the drug unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the drug unless compliance with GCP requirements is satisfactory. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete but the application is not yet ready for approval. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or other significant, expensive, and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies and/or manufacturing. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, requirement to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution programs, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA may also condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 An approved Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, is required for vadadustat under the Pediatric Research Equity Act prior to submission of the NDA. The PSP outlines the study designs and timing of the pediatric program. Once the PSP is approved, Akebia and FDA will have reached agreement on the pediatric studies necessary for vadadustat, any deferrals from pediatric data to be included in the NDA, and any waivers of pediatric age ranges in which vadadustat need not be studied.
 Once the FDA approves an NDA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the drug reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such drug or request a recall of any drug already on the market. In addition, the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. 
 After regulatory approval of a drug is obtained, companies are subject to a number of post-approval requirements. For example, there are reporting obligations regarding certain adverse events received and production problems. Companies are also required to report updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. Drugs may be marketed only for the FDA-approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Physicians legally are permitted to prescribe approved drugs for uses that are not included in the product’s labeling. However, drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and promotional claims must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in warning letters, adverse publicity, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or an NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP requirements after approval to ensure and preserve the long-term identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP requirement and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our drug candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Nonclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the drugs. 
 Regulations Pertaining to Sales and Marketing
 The marketing, distribution and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the United States. 
 Within the United States, numerous federal, state and local authorities have jurisdiction over, or enforce laws related to, such activities, including the FDA, Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Office of Inspector General, Department of Justice, and state Attorneys General. 
 We are subjec
t to the FD&C Act and accompanying regulations that prohibit pharmaceutical companies from promoting a drug prior to approval from the FDA. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we will also be subject to the prohibition on pharmaceutical companies promoting an approved drug in a manner inconsistent with the approved label. Similar laws and regulations exist outside of the United States.
 We will be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to sales of any of our product candidates that may, in the future, receive marketing approval. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that inform how the laws apply to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such anti-kickback laws. In addition, there are federal and state false claims laws that prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). 
 In the United States, laws, and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products. These laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. In addition, several states require compliance with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association of America, or PhRMA, Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, which further regulates pharmaceutical companies’ interactions with healthcare providers. Similarly, there are laws, regulations and industry codes, which will govern our activities outside of the United States, that restrict and govern pharmaceutical companies’ interactions with health care providers, and require disclosure of such interactions. 
 Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
 In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities or programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Within the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. If we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our product candidates, those products could potentially be covered by various government health benefit programs and/or be purchased by government authorities. Participation in such programs or the sale of products to such agencies is subject to regulation. In order to participate in these programs, we may be required to provide discounted pricing or pay rebates on products paid for by government programs or purchasers or other third parties. Coverage of 
 18


pharmaceutical products by private health insurance varies. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Private payers may also use a variety of utilization management techniques designed to control costs even for covered products. In addition, a private payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be provided. The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
 The United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Healthcare Reform Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The law contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for pharmaceutical products such as: 
  
• | increasing drug rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring drug manufacturers to provide a 50% discount on Medicare Part D brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause the beneficiaries to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called “donut hole”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Modifications to, or repeal of, all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act are expected as a result of the outcome of the recent presidential election and Republicans maintaining control of Congress, consistent with statements made by President Trump and members of Congress during the presidential campaign and following the election. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial, or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.  
 Laws Relating to Foreign Trade 
 We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
 In addition, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the United Kingdom generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.
 There are local antibribery and anticorruption laws in countries where we are conducting clinical trials, such as Brazil, and Russia, and many of these also carry the risk of significant financial or criminal penalties. Finally, there are trade laws within the United States and outside that regulate the sale, purchase, import, export, reexport, transfer and shipment of goods, products, materials, services and technology.
 Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 90 employees, 89 of whom were full-time, 18 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 55 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 35 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources or administrative support. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
