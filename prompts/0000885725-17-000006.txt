ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our mission is to transform lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” mean Boston Scientific Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries.
Our history began in the late 1960s when our co-founder, John Abele, acquired an equity interest in Medi-tech, Inc., a research and development company focused on developing alternatives to surgery. In 1969, Medi-tech introduced a family of steerable catheters used in some of the first less-invasive procedures performed. In 1979, John Abele joined with Pete Nicholas to form Boston Scientific Corporation, which indirectly acquired Medi-tech. This acquisition began a period of active and focused new product development, innovation, market development and organizational growth. Since then, we have advanced the practice of less-invasive medicine by helping physicians and other medical professionals diagnose and treat a wide range of diseases and medical conditions and improve patients’ quality of life by providing alternatives to surgery and other medical procedures that are typically traumatic to the body.
Our net sales have increased substantially since our formation. Our growth has been fueled in part by strategic acquisitions designed to improve our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities in the medical device industry and to build depth of portfolio within our focus businesses. Our strategic acquisitions have helped us to add promising new technologies to our pipeline and to offer one of the broadest product portfolios in the world for use in less-invasive procedures in our target areas of Cardiovascular, Rhythm Management, and Medical Surgical. We believe that the depth and breadth of our product portfolio has also enabled us to compete more effectively in the current healthcare environment that seeks to improve outcomes and lower costs. Our strategy of category leadership also enables us to compete in a changing contracting landscape and position our products with physicians, managed care, large buying groups, governments, and consolidation among hospitals, while also expanding internationally and managing the complexities of the global healthcare market.
Business Strategy
We operate following five strategic imperatives: Strengthen Execution to Grow Share, Expand into High Growth Adjacencies, Drive Global Expansion, Fund the Journey to Fuel Growth, and Develop Key Capabilities. We believe that our execution of these strategic imperatives will drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase stockholder value. Our approach to innovation combines internally-developed products and technologies with those we may obtain externally through strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. In addition, we have undertaken several strategic acquisitions to help us to continue to be a leader in the medical device industry. We expect to continue to invest in our core franchises, and also investigate opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, strategic growth adjacencies and new global markets. During the last several years, we have completed multiple acquisitions to strengthen our core franchises and expand into high growth adjacencies and global markets. To support the achievement of our strategic and organizational objectives, we have an Enterprise Risk Management program that coordinates a consolidated view of the key risks inherent in achieving our business strategies so we can anticipate and adapt to potential challenges to preserve and grow shareholder value. Our Board of Directors oversees risk management and focuses on the most significant risks facing the Company including strategic, operational, financial and legal and compliance risks

Cardiovascular
Interventional Cardiology
Drug-Eluting Coronary Stent Systems
Our broad, innovative product offerings have enabled us to become a leader in the global interventional cardiology market. This leadership is due in large part to our drug-eluting coronary stent product offerings. Coronary stents are tiny, mesh tubes used in the treatment of coronary artery disease, which are implanted in patients to prop open arteries and facilitate blood flow to and from the heart. We believe we have further enhanced the outcomes associated with the use of coronary stents, particularly the processes that lead to restenosis (the growth of neointimal tissue within an artery after angioplasty and stenting), through scientific research and product development of drug-eluting stent systems. 
We market the SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System featuring an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating. The SYNERGY Stent is unique in that both its proprietary polymer and everolimus drug coating dissipate by three months. This innovation has the potential to improve post-implant vessel healing and will eliminate long-term polymer exposure, which is a possible cause of late adverse events. In addition, we market the Promus PREMIER™, Promus™ Element™ and Promus™ Element™ Plus Everolimus-Eluting Stents.
Other Coronary Therapies
We market a broad line of products used to treat patients with atherosclerosis, a principal cause of coronary artery obstructive disease, which is characterized by a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries and a narrowing of arterial openings caused by the progressive development of deposits of plaque. Our product offerings include balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures. 
PCI Guidance
We market a family of intravascular catheter-directed ultrasound imaging catheters, fractional flow reserve (FFR) devices, and systems for use in coronary arteries and heart chambers as well as certain peripheral vessels. Our Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging catheter, OptiCross™, has been launched in all major markets worldwide. We initiated the launch of our first FFR product, the COMET™ Pressure Guidewire, in the U.S., Europe, and Japan in 2016. The iLab™ Ultrasound Imaging System with Polaris Software continues as our flagship console and is compatible with our full line of imaging catheters and FFR devices and are designed to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of blocked vessels and heart disorders. These systems have been placed in cardiology labs worldwide and provided an installed base through which we expect to continue to pull through products, including the ongoing launch of our COMET™ FFR Pressure Guidewire. 
Structural Heart Therapies
Structural heart therapy is one of the fastest growing segments of the medical technology market and is highly synergistic with our Interventional Cardiology and Rhythm Management businesses. Through the acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. (Sadra) in January 2011, we have developed a fully repositionable and retrievable device, the Lotus™ Valve System, for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis. The Lotus™ Valve System employs a unique Adaptive Seal™ feature designed to minimize the incidence of paravalvular regurgitation, a predictor of mortality. The Lotus™ Valve System is CE-marked in the European Union (EU). In the U.S. it is an investigational device and not available for commercial sale. At the end of 2015, we completed enrollment in our REPRISE III pivotal clinical trial. We have three valve sizes CE marked: 23, 25 and 27mm, and we are developing 21 and 29mm size valves to complete our size matrix. In September 2016, we commenced a limited launch of our next generation catheter and sheath, the Lotus EDGE™ Valve System, in Europe. In October 2016, we suspended our limited launch and initiated a voluntary removal of field inventory of the Lotus EDGE™ system due to reports that, in some cases, the device could not be fully locked during the procedure due to premature release of a pin connecting the Lotus EDGE™ Valve to the delivery system. In February 2017, we initiated a voluntary removal of all Lotus™ Valve devices, including Lotus with Depth Guard™, from global commercial and clinical sites due to reports of premature release of a pin connecting the Lotus™ Valve to the delivery system. As with the prior announced suspension of our Lotus Edge™ Valve System device, we believe that the issue is caused by excess tension in the pin mechanism introduced during the manufacturing process. We expect to bring the Lotus™ Valve platform back to market in Europe and other regions in the fourth quarter of 2017. We anticipate filing the U.S. PMA submission for the Lotus Edge™ Valve System, the next generation platform, in the fourth quarter of 2017, with a U.S. launch planned for mid-2018.

Through the acquisition of Atritech, Inc. (Atritech) in March 2011, we have developed a novel device, the Watchman™ Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device, designed to close the left atrial appendage to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Watchman Device has been commercially available internationally since 2009 and is the leading device in percutaneous LAAC globally. In March of 2015, Watchman Device received FDA approval to treat patients who are at an elevated risk of stroke, deemed suitable for warfarin, and have appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to warfarin. We believe that Watchman Device will be the only LAAC technology commercially available in the U.S. for multiple years, and in November 2015, we received CE Mark for our next generation device, Watchman FLX™ LAAC Device. Shortly after approval, we began a European initial market release of Watchman FLX™ Device. The initial market release was suspended near the end of the first quarter of 2016 due to a higher than expected rate of device embolization. Following an extensive data evaluation, we have decided to pursue certain design enhancements prior to returning a next generation device to market.
On December 12, 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain manufacturing assets and capabilities of the Neovasc, Inc. advanced biological tissue business and made a 15 percent equity investment in Neovasc. With this acquisition, we will integrate certain manufacturing assets and biologic tissue capabilities into our structural heart business for use in the manufacturing of the Lotus™ Valve System and future heart valve technologies within our Interventional Cardiology business.We began the process of integrating Neovasc into our Interventional Cardiology business in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2018.
Peripheral Interventions
We sell various products designed to treat patients with peripheral arterial disease (disease which appears in blood vessels other than in the heart and in the biliary tree), including a broad line of medical devices used in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and peripheral vascular stenting. Our peripheral product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and vena cava filters. Our peripheral angioplasty balloon technology includes our next-generation Mustang™ PTA Balloon Catheter; our Coyote™ Balloon Catheter, a highly deliverable and ultra-low profile balloon dilatation catheter designed for a wide range of peripheral angioplasty procedures; and our Charger™ PTA Balloon Catheter, a 0.035” percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter designed for post-stent dilatation as well as conventional balloon angioplasty to open blocked peripheral arteries. With our Coyote, Mustang and Charger Devices, we offer balloons across all size platforms. Our peripheral stent technology includes our EPIC™ Self-Expanding Nitinol Stent System, our Carotid WALLSTENT™ Stent System, and our Innova™ Self-Expanding Stent System. In addition, we market our 0.035" Rubicon™ Support Catheter in both the U.S. and Europe. We are currently conducting a pivotal study designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Eluvia™ Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System, which received CE Mark in February 2016 and is designed to treat patients with narrowing or blockages in the SFA or proximal popliteal artery (PPA). We are also conducting an additional study on the safety and effectiveness of our RANGER™ Drug-Coated Balloon.
In August 2014, we acquired the Interventional Division of Bayer AG (Bayer). The addition of Bayer innovative technologies supports our strategy to provide a comprehensive portfolio of leading solutions to treat peripheral vascular disease, including venous disease. The transaction included the leading AngioJet™ Thrombectomy System which is used in endovascular procedures to remove blood clots from blocked arteries and veins, and the JetStream™ Atherectomy System, used to remove plaque and thrombi from diseased arteries. We have since launched the AngioJet™ ZelanteDVT™ Thrombectomy Catheter to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in large-diameter upper and lower limb peripheral veins, in the U.S. and Europe. 
We also sell products designed to treat patients with non-vascular disease (disease that appears outside the blood system), primarily in interventional oncology. Our non-vascular suite of products includes biliary stents, drainage catheters and micro-puncture sets designed to treat, diagnose and ease various forms of benign and malignant tumors. We market our Direxion™ Torqueable Microcatheter in both the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we continue to market our extensive line of interventional oncology product solutions, including the Renegade™ HI-FLO™ Fathom™ Microcatheter and guidewire system and Interlock™ - 35 Fibered IDC™ and 18 Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System for peripheral embolization. 
On December 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the interventional radiology business of CeloNova Biosciences (CeloNova). The acquisition includes drug-eluting microspheres designed to be loaded with chemotherapy drugs for delivery to cancerous tumors, and spherical embolic products used to treat uterine fibroids and other conditions. We are in the process of integrating CeloNova into our Peripheral Interventions business and expect to be substantially complete by the second half of 2017.

Research and Development
Our investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. We expended $920 million on research and development in 2016, $876 million in 2015, and $817 million in 2014. Our investment in research and development reflects the following:

• | internal research and development programs, regulatory design, and clinical science, as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances; and

 8


• | engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and next-generation products.

We have directed our development efforts toward innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets. We are transforming how we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure, which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept to market timelines. Our approach to new product design and development is through focused, cross-functional teams. We believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer and manufacture innovative products in a consistent and timely manner. Involvement of the cross-functional teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle. We believe this collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies, and focus on bringing them to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. In addition to internal development, we work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. We are expanding our collaborations to include research and development teams in emerging markets; these teams will focus on both global and local market requirements at a lower cost of development. We believe that a part of our future success will depend upon the strength of these development efforts.
Marketing and Sales
During 2016, we marketed our products to approximately 35,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical offices in the U.S. and to approximately 120 countries worldwide. The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third party distributors in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence. No single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2016, 2015 or 2014; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. We have a dedicated corporate sales organization in the U.S. focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks. We consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions. We believe that this focus on disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians. We believe that we have positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry which enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients. 
International Operations
International net sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our net sales in 2016. Maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Through our international presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to bring new products to market, and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to strengthen our sales capabilities and maximize our opportunities in these countries.
As of December 31, 2016, we had six principal international manufacturing facilities, including three in Ireland, two in Costa Rica and one in Puerto Rico. Approximately 45 percent of our products manufactured in 2016 were produced at these facilities. Additionally, we maintain research and development capabilities in Ireland, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Germany, India and China. We operate physician training centers in France, Japan, South Africa, Germany, Italy and India.

Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter. 
Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs. 
Quality Assurance
We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. These systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations, including those of the FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization for medical devices, which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an independent outside auditor. Maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.
Environmental Regulation and Management
We are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers, stockholders and employees. We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, the depletion of natural resources, and our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We are certified to the FTSE4Good Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by The Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility. This certification recognizes our dedication to those standards, and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policies.
We have obtained ISO 14001:2004 certifications at our major manufacturing plants and Tier 1 distribution centers around the world, as well as our Corporate Headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts. ISO 14001:2004 is a globally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems, established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business. Using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the U.S., Ireland, Costa Rica and the Netherlands, we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint.
Competition
We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products from various companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories; Medtronic plc; and Cook Medical; as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states which could also be treated using our products.
We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers; while also continuing to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively in a less-invasive manner, as well as to provide ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, with economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. 
 10

We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to: offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes; create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies; apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets; develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions; attract and retain skilled personnel; obtain patent or other protection for our products; obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals; continually enhance our quality systems; manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties; and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.
Medical Device Regulatory Approvals
The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, based on the risk level of the device. 
In the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device, the “predicate” device. Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.
The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices, and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose, and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.
The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). An HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, fewer than 4,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in both form and content to a PMA application, but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA. The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations.
In the European Economic Area (EEA), we are required to comply with applicable Medical Device Directives, specifically the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, and obtain CE Mark Certification in order to market medical devices within the EEA. The CE Mark is applied depending on device classification, either following approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification. CE Marking is a symbol of compliance to the applicable Essential Requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and associated Standards.  The EU regulatory bodies will finalize a new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in 2017, which will replace the existing Directives and will provide three years for transition and compliance.  The MDR will change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as clinical data requirements, and introduce new ones, such as Unique Device Identification (UDI).  We, and the Notified Bodies who will oversee compliance to the new MDR, face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the Commission and EEA Competent Authorities, creating risks in several areas including the CE Marking process and data transparency in the upcoming years.
We are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products before we can launch new products, such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and China Food and Drug Administration. Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations, or minimal such regulations, are now introducing them. For example, India is in the process of establishing new medical device regulations.
The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reporting of adverse events, 
 11

labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country, or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.
International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.
Government Affairs 
We maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington, D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies impacting us, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and Administration offices, state legislatures and regulatory agencies, and governments overseas on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state and global decision-makers, while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general.
Healthcare Policies
Political, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments, and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers, and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption.
The impact to our business of the United States’ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) provisions related to coverage expansion, payment reforms, and delivery system has been immaterial. The ACA and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. In December 2015, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, or PATH Act, was passed, which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 2.3 percent excise tax until December 31, 2017. We have substantially reinvested the amounts we would have expended on this tax into jobs, innovation, research and development, collaborations with universities, and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growth.
The Federal government, as part of the ACA, and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency, or "sunshine," in relationships between medical device, biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals (HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of payments and items of value provided to HCPs. Certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws. Failure to comply with sunshine laws and/or implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
 12

The federal election results in the U.S. may result in changes to insurance coverage, financing of insurance coverage in both the employer-sponsored insurance and individual markets, government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and federal sunshine laws. At this point, the impact of any such changes through repeal of, or major changes to, the ACA is unclear because specific changes in laws have not been enacted. Similarly, the status of the medical device tax after December 31, 2017 is not clear. While the specific policies that the new Administration and Congress may enact are not known, as noted below, we expect certain trends to continue placing pressure on pricing in the U.S.
We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs) continue to take shape globally. We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing globally as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power. Similarly, governments are increasing the use of tenders, placing pressure on medical device pricing. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital’s or physician's selection of products used to treat patients.
Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance payers, for the services provided to their patients.
Third-party payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated procedures.
Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2016, we held more than 19,000 patents, and had approximately 6,000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license, except for those relating to our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, is material in relation to our business as a whole.
We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties. 
We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See Item 3 and Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2016 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property, product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved. 
 13

Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 27,000 employees, including approximately 13,000 in operations; 9,000 in selling, marketing and distribution; 4,000 in clinical, regulatory and research and development; and 3,000 in administration. Of these employees, we employed approximately 14,000 outside the U.S., approximately 8,000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function.
Community Outreach
We are committed to Advancing Science to transform the lives of others and the communities we all call home. We bring this commitment to life by supporting local, regional and global health and education initiatives, striving to improve patient advocacy, adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments, and minimizing our impact on the environment. 
We know that the world can be transformed when we apply the forces of compassion and the spirit of possibility to make a difference in communities today and in the future. When people have greater access to healthcare and health information, and when children are given the opportunity to achieve academically, communities become healthy and vibrant. For example, by working with Project HOPE (Health Opportunities for People Everywhere) in 2016, thousands of people in the Ranchi District in India and in rural Johannesburg, South Africa were screened for chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. Not only were people informed about their health risks and educated about prevention, but new screening protocols were implemented and healthcare workers were trained to provide services well into the future. 
Our focus on the next generation of innovators is evident in the over 150 Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) events and school programs we collaborated on with others to support the ever-curious minds of young learners around the world. Last year, more than 3,000 employee volunteers dedicated their time and talent to make a positive impact at more than 350 global community events in 21 countries.
Through the Boston Scientific Foundation, more than 40 nonprofit organizations across the U.S. received nearly a million dollars in grant awards in 2016. These community grants are targeted to benefit disadvantaged populations by investing in programs that increase access to quality healthcare and improve educational opportunities, particularly related to STEM education. In addition, the Foundation also provides scholarships to college-bound students of U.S. based Boston Scientific employees.
Seasonality
Our worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, customer purchases have historically been lower in the third quarter of the year, as compared to other quarters. This reflects, among other factors, lower demand during summer months in the northern hemisphere, particularly in European countries.
