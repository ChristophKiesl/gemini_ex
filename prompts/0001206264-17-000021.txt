ITEM 1. BUSINESS    
General

We are the world's largest bedding manufacturer. We develop, manufacture, market, and distribute bedding products, which we sell globally in approximately 100 countries. Our brand portfolio includes many highly recognized brands in the industry, including our Tempur products sold under the TEMPUR® and Tempur-Pedic® brands, and our Sealy products sold under the Sealy®, Sealy Posturepedic®, and Stearns & Foster® brands. In 2017, the Sealy® brand will also feature Posturepedic Technology™ in the Sealy Performance™ and Sealy Premium™ collections. Our comprehensive suite of bedding products offers a variety of products to consumers across a broad range of channels.
We operate in two segments: North America and International. Corporate operating expenses are not included in either of the segments and are presented separately as a reconciling item to consolidated results. These segments are strategic business units that are managed separately based on geography. Our North America segment consists of Tempur and Sealy manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees located in the U.S. and Canada. Our International segment consists of Tempur and Sealy manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees located in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. We evaluate segment performance based on net sales, gross profit and operating income. Financial information about our segments and geographic areas is included elsewhere in this Report in Part II, ITEM 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Note 16, "Business Segment Information," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, ITEM 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
We sell our products through two distribution channels in each segment: Retail (furniture and bedding retailers, department stores, specialty retailers and warehouse clubs); and Other (direct-to-consumer through e-commerce platforms; company-owned stores and call centers; third party distributors; hospitality and healthcare customers).

Strategy 

Our long-term strategy is to drive earnings growth. Our goal is to improve the sleep of more people, every night, all around the world. In order to achieve our long-term strategy while managing the current economic and competitive environments, we will focus on developing the best bedding products, investing in our brands, expanding our North America margins while maintaining market share, growing our market share in International and optimizing our worldwide distribution. Through our strategy, we will generate earnings growth and strong cash flow that will be used to reduce debt to the extent appropriate and return value to stockholders.
 Our Products and Brands
We have a comprehensive offering of products that appeal to a broad range of consumers, some of which are covered by one or more patents and/or patent applications. We also routinely introduce new mattress models, launch new products and update our existing mattress products in each of our segments. Our products are divided into two categories, as described below:

• | Bedding - Our bedding product category includes mattresses, foundations and adjustable foundations and represented 92.5% of our net sales in 2016.

4


• | Other - Our other product category includes pillows, mattress covers, sheets, cushions and various other comfort products and represented 7.5% of our net sales in 2016.

In order to achieve our goal to improve the sleep of more people, every night, all around the world, one of our strategic initiatives is to leverage and strengthen our comprehensive portfolio of iconic brands and products. Our brand portfolio includes many highly recognized brands, including TEMPUR®, Tempur-Pedic®, Sealy®, Sealy Posturepedic® and Stearns & Foster®, which are described below: 

• | Tempur-Pedic - Founded in 1991, the Tempur brand is our specialty innovation category leader designed to provide life changing sleep for our wellness seeking consumers. Our proprietary Tempur material precisely adapts to the shape, weight and temperature of the consumer and creates fewer pressure points, reduces motion transfer and provides personalized comfort and support.


• | Stearns & Foster - The Stearns & Foster brand offers our consumers high quality mattresses built by certified craftsmen who have been specially trained. Founded in 1846, the brand is designed and built with precise engineering and relentless attention to detail and fuses new innovative technologies with time-honored techniques, creating supremely comfortable beds.


• | Sealy - The Sealy brand originated in 1881 in Sealy, Texas, and for over a century has focused on offering trusted comfort, durability and excellent value while maintaining contemporary styles and great support. In 2017, we are uniting all of our Sealy products under one masterbrand, which will include the Posturepedic Technology™ as described below.


• | Sealy Posturepedic - The Sealy Posturepedic brand, introduced in 1950, is engineered to provide all-over support and body alignment to allow full relaxation and deliver a comfortable night's sleep. In 2017, Sealy Posturepedic will no longer represent its own separate brand, but will be featured as Posturepedic Technology™ in the Sealy Performance™ and Sealy Premium™ collections.


• | Cocoon by Sealy - The Cocoon by Sealy brand, introduced in 2016, is our new offering in the below $1,000 e-commerce space, made with the high quality materials that consumers expect from Sealy, sold online at www.cocoonbysealy.com and delivered in a box directly to consumers' doorsteps.

Our 2016 product introductions included the new line of Stearns & Foster® products. The new Reserve Collection offers our exclusive Hybrid Pillowtop featuring our Nano Comfort™ Quilt Layer. The innovative mattress top design delivers precise support and superior adaptiveness. In addition, we updated our existing Stearns & Foster® Estate, Lux Estate and Lux Estate Hybrid product lines, which, along with the Reserve Collection, now offer four exclusive features: IntelliCoil® Advanced coil design, PrecisionEdge™ edge system, PrimaCool™ performance fabric and Advanced Adapt™ foam. We also updated our TEMPUR-Breeze line to include state-of-the-art PureCool™ Comfort technology, an ultra breathable design and a premium cooling cover. These upgrades provide more refreshing sleep for consumers seeking a cooler sleeping environment.
In 2017, we are planning significant new product introductions in our North America and International segments. In North America, we are uniting all of our Sealy products under one masterbrand. Product introductions will include new Sealy products in two distinct lines: Response and Conform. The new Sealy Essentials™, Sealy Performance™, and Sealy Premium™ Collections combine smart innovation, precise engineering and industry-leading testing to ensure quality and durability. Sealy's exclusive Posturepedic Technology™ will be featured in the Performance and Premium Collections, offering the highest quality materials to target the right level of support for each area of the body. In addition, we are introducing the new Tempur-Pedic Anniversary collection to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Company’s founding and relaunching our flagship line of Tempur mattresses in International to feature the iconic aesthetics similar to Tempur-Pedic mattresses that you see in North America. 
Our Channels
We sell our products through two channels: Retail and Other. 
5

Retail
Our Retail channel sells to furniture and bedding retailers, department stores and warehouse clubs, among others and represented 89.8% of net sales in 2016. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 38.7% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Mattress Firm Inc. (“Mattress Firm”), which was acquired by Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. ("Steinhoff") in September 2016 and is a customer within the North America segment, was our largest customer for 2016. In February 2016, Mattress Firm acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in HMK Mattress Holdings, LLC ("Sleepy’s"). Sleepy’s has historically been one of the Company's top five customers and, as a result of this acquisition, the combined companies represented 21.4%and 23.7% of the Company's sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, and 2015 respectively. In January 2017, we terminated our contracts with Mattress Firm and we expect to wind down our relationship with Mattress Firm over the first quarter of 2017. See ITEM 1A, "Risk Factors," and ITEM 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Factors That Could Impact Results of Operations" for a discussion of the anticipated impact of this termination and the Company's strategy moving forward.
Other
Our Other channel sells directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms, company-owned stores and call centers, and to third party, healthcare and hospitality customers and represented 10.2% of net sales in 2016. Third party includes sales to distributors in countries where we do not sell directly through our own subsidiaries. Healthcare includes sales to hospitals, nursing homes, healthcare professionals and medical retailers. Hospitality sales include hotels. 
Marketing
Our overall marketing strategy is to drive consumer demand through the use of effective marketing. We invest across multiple media platforms to build brand awareness and drive consumer interest in our products. Our strategy varies by segment; however, the majority of our advertising programs are created on a centralized basis through our in-house advertising organization. In 2017, we plan to drive net sales through continued investments in new products, marketing and other initiatives.
North America
Our North America segment sells primarily through the Retail channel, which contributed 94.1% of North America segment sales in 2016. In North America, we advertise nationally on television, digitally and through consumer and trade print. In addition, we participate in cooperative advertising on a shared basis with some of our retail customers. Throughout the year, we relied on a series of strategic initiatives, which included: new product introductions, advertising and in-store marketing investments. 
International
Our International segment sells primarily through the Retail channel, which contributed 69.8% of International segment net sales in 2016. Our advertising strategy in our International segment focuses on building brand awareness, which we believe is important to increasing our overall market share. We advertise on television, digitally and through consumer and trade print, as well as cooperative advertising on a shared basis with some of our retail customers. We believe there is significant opportunity to drive sales growth in our International segment through the expansion of product lines within existing channels, increasing our market share in previously underpenetrated markets and, where appropriate, entering into new markets. 
Seasonality

We believe that sales of products to furniture and bedding stores are typically subject to modest seasonality inherent in the bedding industry, with sales expected to be generally lower in the second and fourth quarters. We may not experience our typical seasonality in 2017 as we pursue our strategy to recapture market share in the U.S. Our sales in a particular quarter can also be impacted by new product launches. Additionally, the U.S. bedding industry generally experiences increases in sales around holidays and promotional periods.
Operations 

Manufacturing and Distribution 
Our products are currently manufactured and distributed through our global network of facilities. 
6


Suppliers 
We obtain the raw materials used to produce our pressure-relieving TEMPUR® material from outside sources. We currently acquire chemicals and proprietary additives for Tempur products from a number of suppliers with manufacturing locations around the world. These supplier relationships may be revised in order to maintain quality, cost, and delivery expectations. We do not consider ourselves dependent upon any single outside vendor as a source of raw materials for Tempur products and believe that sufficient alternative sources of supply for the same or similar raw materials are available. Additionally, we source a portion of the manufacturing of our adjustable bed bases and foundations from third party manufacturers. We do not consider ourselves dependent upon any single outside manufacturer as a source of these products.
In connection with the general supply chain risks described above, with respect to our Sealy products our raw materials consist of polyurethane foam, polyester, polyethylene foam and steel innerspring components that we purchase from various suppliers. In the U.S. and Canada, we source the majority of our requirements for polyurethane foam components and spring components for our Sealy and Stearns & Foster mattress units from a key supplier for each component. These components are purchased under supply agreements. We also purchase a significant portion of our Sealy foundation parts from third party sources under supply agreements. We do not consider ourselves to be dependent in the long term upon any single outside vendor as a source of supply to our bedding business, and we believe over time that sufficient alternative sources of supply for the same, similar or alternative components are available. However, for many of these components if our key supplier for the applicable component failed to supply components in the amount we require this could significantly interrupt production of our products and increase our production costs.
Research and Development 
We have four research and development centers, three in the U.S. and one in Denmark, which conduct technology and product development. Additionally, we have a product testing facility that conducts hundreds of consumer tests annually. We believe our consumer-research driven approach to innovation results in best-in-class products that benefit the consumer. Research and development expenses were $26.7 million, $28.7 million and $21.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Industry and Competition
We compete in the global bedding industry, where we are the only truly global participant. The bedding industry is comprised of mattresses and foundations, pillows and accessories. The mattress market category is comprised of traditional innerspring mattresses and non-innerspring mattresses, which includes visco-elastic and foam mattresses, innerspring/foam hybrid mattresses, airbeds and latex mattresses. The foundation category is comprised of traditional foundations and adjustable foundations. Additionally, the pillow market is comprised of traditional foam and feather pillows, as well as pillows made of visco-elastic, latex, foam, sponge, rubber and down. The primary distribution channels for mattresses and foundations are retail furniture and bedding stores, department stores and warehouse clubs.
We encounter competition from a number of bedding manufacturers in both the highly concentrated domestic and highly fragmented international markets. Participants in each of these markets compete primarily on price, quality, brand name recognition, product availability and product performance. In addition, mattress and pillow manufacturers and retailers are seeking to increase their channels of distribution and are looking for new ways to reach the consumer, including the recent expansion in the number of companies pursuing online direct-to-consumer models for foam mattresses. 
The U.S. is the largest market in which we compete. Since 1996, U.S. wholesale bedding sales, which include mattresses and foundations, have grown at a compound annual growth rate, or "CAGR", of 4.7%, reaching approximately $8.0 billion in 2015 according to the International Sleep Products Association (“ISPA”). According to ISPA, U.S. mattress producer shipments increased 4.5% in 2015 as compared to 2014, making 2015 the sixth consecutive yearly unit increase since 2010. Additionally, the value of mattress shipments increased 6.8% in 2015, also the sixth consecutive yearly increase in dollar value since 2010. The value of mattress shipments set a new high in 2015. Unit shipments in 2015 set a new post-recession high, but are still below historical records, according to ISPA. Assuming the health of the overall economy continues to improve, we believe the mattress industry is well positioned for future growth.
7

Industry growth has been driven by increases in average unit selling price (“AUSP”) primarily due to consumer awareness of the ongoing new health benefits of better sleep discovered by the medical community. Additionally, industry growth over the past several years has been driven by an increase in overall consumer brand awareness, the highly profitable nature of the mattress industry for manufacturers and retailers, an overall increase in adjustable foundation attachment rates, innovative technology and consumer demographics.
The U.S. mattress market has experienced consolidation among manufacturers in recent years. We, together with Serta Simmons Bedding, LLC, which sells products under the Serta and Simmons brands, collectively accounted for a significant share of the wholesale bedding industry revenues in 2015 based on figures obtained from ISPA and Furniture/Today industry publications. The balance of the mattress market in the U.S. is served by a large number of other manufacturers. In addition, there has been consolidation of mattress retailers in the U.S. over the last several years, driven principally by Mattress Firm.
The international market is served by a large number of manufacturers, primarily operating on a regional and local basis. These manufacturers offer a broad range of mattress and pillow products. 
The highly competitive nature of the mattress and pillow industries means we are continually subject to the risk of loss of market share, loss of significant customers, reductions in margins, and the inability to acquire new customers.
Intellectual Property
Patents, Trademarks and Licensing

We hold various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications regarding certain elements of the design and function of many of our mattress and pillow products.

As of December 31, 2016, we held trademark registrations worldwide, which we believe have significant value and are important to the marketing of our products to retailers. TEMPUR® and Tempur-Pedic® are trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we have U.S. applications pending for additional trademarks. Several of our trademarks have been registered, or are the subject of pending applications, in various foreign countries. Each U.S. trademark registration is renewable indefinitely as long as the trademark remains in use. We also own numerous trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos and design marks, including Sealy®, Stearns & Foster® and Sealy Posturepedic®. We also license the Bassett® trade name in various territories under a long-term agreement. 

We derive income from royalties by licensing Sealy® brands, technology and trademarks to other manufacturers. Our licenses include rights for the licensees to use trademarks as well as current proprietary or patented technology utilized by us. We also provide our licensees with product specifications, research and development, statistical services and marketing programs. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our licensing activities as a whole generated unaffiliated net royalties of approximately $19.5 million.
Governmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to state, local and foreign consumer protection and other regulations relating to the mattress and pillow industry. These regulations vary among the states and countries in which we do business. The regulations generally impose requirements as to the proper labeling of bedding merchandise, restrictions regarding the identification of merchandise as “new” or otherwise, controls as to hygiene and other aspects of product handling and sale and penalties for violations. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has adopted rules relating to fire retardancy standards for the mattress industry. Many foreign jurisdictions also regulate fire retardancy standards. Future changes to these standards may require modifications to our products to comply with these additional standards. We are also subject to environmental and health and safety requirements with regard to the manufacture of our products and conduct of our operations and facilities. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures necessary to comply with these requirements. Currently these expenditures are immaterial to our financial results.
8

Our principal waste products are foam and fabric scraps, wood, cardboard and other non-hazardous materials derived from product component supplies and packaging. We also periodically dispose of (primarily by recycling) small amounts of used machine lubricating oil and air compressor waste oil. In the U.S., we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental health and safety, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable international, federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations. We do not expect that compliance with international, federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We are not aware of any pending federal environmental legislation which would have a material impact on our operations, and have not been required to make and do not expect to make any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the foreseeable future.
 Employees 

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 7,300 Tempur Sealy employees, approximately 4,900 of which are located in North America and 2,400 in the rest of the world. Approximately 34.2% of our employees are represented by various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements. Due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements, we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees. We consider our overall relations with our workforce to be satisfactory. Our current collective bargaining agreements, which are typically one to three years in length, expire at various times beginning in 2017 through 2019. As of December 31, 2016, our North America segment employed approximately 600 individuals covered under collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2017 and our International segment employed approximately 1,000 individuals covered under collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2017.
