Item 1. Business.
Our Company
We were formed on March 26, 2018 as a Delaware statutory trust structured as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the  rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “1940 Act”). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (a “RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of  1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Code”). We are managed by our Adviser. Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors LP (the “Administrator” and, collectively with its affiliates in the credit-focused business of The Blackstone Group Inc., “Blackstone Credit,” which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes Harvest Fund Advisors LLC and Blackstone Insurance Solutions (“BIS”) provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate.
Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation.  
Under normal market conditions, we generally invest at least 80% of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in secured debt investments (including investments that are secured by equity interests). Our portfolio is composed primarily of first lien senior secured and unitranche loans (including first out/last out loans), generally with total investment sizes less than $300 million, which criteria may change from time to time. To a lesser extent, we have and may continue to also invest in second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, generally with total investment sizes less than $100 million, which criteria may change from time to time, and other debt and equity securities. We do not currently expect to focus on investments in issuers that are distressed or in need of rescue financing. Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other Blackstone Credit funds. As of December 31, 2020, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 98.51% first lien senior secured investments and unitranche loans, 0.90% second lien debt investments and 0.59% in equity instruments. All of our debt investments as of December 31, 2020 were floating rate in nature (88.0% of which had an interest rate floor above zero) and the weighted average yield on our income producing investments was 7.68% at fair value. As of December 31, 2020 we had investments in 81 portfolio companies, with a weighted average debt investment size in each of our portfolio companies of approximately $69.4 million based on fair value.
  As a BDC, at least 70% of our assets must be the type of "qualifying" assets listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, as described herein, which are generally privately-offered securities issued by U.S. private or thinly-traded companies. We may also invest up to 30% of our portfolio opportunistically in "non-qualifying" portfolio investments, such as investments in non-U.S. companies. We generally intend to distribute substantially all of our available earnings annually by making quarterly cash distributions. We use leverage and intend to continue to use leverage for our investment activities. We use and intend to continue to use leverage, which is permitted up to the maximum amount allowed by the 1940 Act (currently limited to a debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1), to enhance potential returns. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Borrowings.”
Effective on December 10, 2020, we changed our name from “Blackstone / GSO Secured Lending Fund” to “Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.”
COVID-19 Update
Equity, debt, lending and other financial markets have experienced significant volatility recently related to COVID-19 pandemic and its effects. Although many markets have experienced varying degrees of recovery since the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the future impact of the pandemic on financial markets and the Company and its investments is still uncertain. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional risks around COVID-19 and its impact on the Company. 
Our Investment Adviser
Our investment activities are managed by our Adviser, a subsidiary of Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors LP, the primary investment manager for Blackstone Credit. The principal executive offices of our Adviser are located at 345 Park Avenue, 31st Floor New York, NY, 10154. Our Adviser is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.

In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of Blackstone Credit, including our Adviser and its affiliates, subject to the policies and procedures of The Blackstone Group Inc. (collectively with its affiliates as the context requires, “Blackstone”) regarding the management of conflicts of interest. In order to source transactions, the Adviser utilizes its significant access to transaction flow, along with its trading platform. The Adviser seeks to generate investment opportunities through direct origination channels as well as through syndicate and club deals. With respect to Blackstone Credit’s origination channel, the global presence of Blackstone Credit generates access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with what we believe to be attractive investment characteristics. With respect to syndicate and club deals (i.e., where a limited number of investors participate in a loan transaction), Blackstone Credit has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. Blackstone Credit also has a significant trading platform, which, we believe, allows us access to the secondary market for investment opportunities. Blackstone Credit employs a rigorous investment process and defensive investment approach to evaluate all potential opportunities with a focus on long-term credit performance and principal protection. The investment professionals employed by Blackstone Credit have spent their careers developing the resources necessary to invest in private companies. Before undertaking an investment, the Adviser’s transaction team conducts a thorough and rigorous due diligence review of the opportunity to ensure the company fits our investment strategy.
Our Adviser’s investment committee (the “Investment Committee”) is responsible for reviewing and approving our investment opportunities. The Adviser’s Investment Committee review process is consensus-driven, multi-step and iterative, and occurs in parallel with the diligence and structuring of investments. Others who participate in the Investment Committee process include the team responsible for conducting due diligence, others on the investing team and other senior members of Blackstone Credit.  There are no representatives from other business groups of Blackstone involved in the Adviser’s Investment Committee process.
We pay our Adviser a management fee at an annual rate of (i) prior to an Exchange Listing (defined below), 0.75%, and (ii) following an Exchange Listing, 1.0%, in each case of the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. We also pay the Adviser incentive fees based on income and capital gains. See “—Investment Advisory Agreement.”
The members of the senior management and Investment Team of the Adviser serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do, or of investment funds managed by the same personnel. As a result, the Adviser, its officers and employees and certain of its affiliates will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between us and other activities in which they are or may become involved, including the management of its affiliated equipment funds. See “—Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interests” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Adviser and Its Affiliates; Conflicts of Interest.”
Our Administrator
Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors LP, a Delaware limited partnership, serves as our Administrator. The principal executive offices of our Administrator are located at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154. We reimburse the Administrator for its costs, expenses and allocable overhead (including compensation of personnel performing administrative duties) in connection with administrative services performed for us. See “—Administration Agreement.”
Blackstone Credit
Blackstone Credit is part of the credit-focused platform of Blackstone, which is a leading global manager of private capital. Blackstone’s asset management businesses include investment vehicles focused on real estate, private equity, public debt and equity, growth equity, opportunistic, non-investment grade credit, real assets and secondary funds, all on a global basis.
Blackstone’s four business segments are real estate, private equity, hedge fund solutions and credit. Through its different investment businesses, as of December 31, 2020, Blackstone had total assets under management of approximately $619 billion. As of December 31, 2020, Blackstone Credit’s asset management operation had aggregate assets under management of approximately $145 billion across multiple strategies within the leveraged finance marketplace, including loans, high yield bonds, distressed and mezzanine debt and private equity, including hedge funds. Blackstone Credit, through its affiliates, employed over 400 people in New York, London, Houston and Dublin, and satellite offices in Baltimore, San Francisco, Toronto, Frankfurt and Milan as of January 1, 2021. As of January 1, 2021, Blackstone Credit had a 82 person U.S. Direct Lending team (excluding Dwight Scott, a member of Blackstone Credit's senior management) focused on the sourcing, structuring, execution management and realization of performing credit investments (which includes those professionals who 
5


focus primarily on direct lending investments).  Blackstone Credit believes that the depth and breadth of its team provides it with a significant competitive advantage in sourcing product on a global basis, structuring transactions and actively managing investments in the portfolio.
Market Opportunity
We believe that there are and will continue to be significant investment opportunities in the targeted asset classes discussed below.
Attractive Opportunities in Senior Secured Loans
We believe that opportunities in senior secured loans are significant because of the variable rate structure of most senior secured debt issues and because of the strong defensive characteristics of this investment class. Given current market conditions, we believe that debt issues with variable interest rates may offer a superior return profile to fixed-rate securities, since variable interest rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment.
While there is inherent risk in investing in any securities, senior secured debt is on the top of the capital structure and thus has priority in payment among an issuer's security holders (i.e. senior secured debt holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders). Further, these investments are secured by the issuer’s assets, which may be seized in the event of a default, if necessary. Senior secured debt often has restrictive covenants for the purpose of additional principal protection and ensuring repayment before junior creditors (i.e. most types of unsecured bondholders, and other security holders) and preserving collateral to protect against credit deterioration.
Opportunity in Middle Market Private Companies
In addition to investing in senior secured loans generally, we believe that the market for lending to private companies, particularly middle market private companies within the United States, is underserved and presents a compelling investment opportunity. We believe that the following characteristics support our belief:
Large and Growing Target Market. Middle market companies represent a large and growing portion of the U.S. economy. According to the National Center for the Middle Market, there were nearly 200,000 middle market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, as of June 30, 2020. Middle market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment programs advised by Blackstone Credit and its affiliates over the past several years, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.
Limited Investment Competition. Despite the size of the market, we believe that regulatory changes and other factors have diminished the role of traditional financial institutions and certain other capital providers in providing financing to middle market companies. As tracked by S&P Capital IQ LCD, U.S. banks’ share of senior secured loans has declined from 33.1% in 1995 to 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, due to bank consolidation, the number of banks has also rapidly declined, furthering the lack of supply in middle market lending. As of April 2020, there were approximately 4,404 banks in the U.S., which was only one-third of the number of banks in 1984, according to Federal Reserve Economic Data.
We also believe that lending and originating new loans to middle market companies, which are often private, generally requires a greater dedication of the lender’s time and resources compared to lending to larger companies, due in part to the smaller size of each investment and the often fragmented nature of information available from these companies. Further, we believe that many investment firms lack the breadth and scale necessary to identify investment opportunities, particularly in regards to directly originated investments in middle market companies, and thus attractive investment opportunities are often overlooked. In addition, middle market companies may require more active monitoring and participation on the lender’s part. We believe that many large financial organizations, which often have relatively high cost structures, are not suited to deal with these factors and instead emphasize services and transactions to larger corporate clients with a consequent reduction in the availability of financing to middle market companies.
Attractive Market Segment. We believe that the underserved nature of such a large segment of the market can at times create a significant opportunity for investment. In many environments, we believe that middle market companies are more likely to offer attractive economics in terms of transaction pricing, up-front and ongoing fees, prepayment penalties and security features in the form of stricter covenants and quality collateral than loans to larger companies. In addition, as compared to larger companies, middle market companies often have simpler capital structures and carry less leverage, thus aiding the 
6


structuring and negotiation process and allowing us greater flexibility in structuring favorable transactions. We believe that these factors will result in advantageous conditions in which to pursue our investment objectives of generating current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation.
Blackstone Credit Strengths
Blackstone Credit is a key player in the middle and upper-middle market direct lending space and in the private credit space generally. Blackstone Credit has experience scaling funds across its platform that invest throughout all parts of the capital structure. Blackstone Credit strives to focus on transactions where it can differentiate itself from other providers of capital, targeting larger transactions and those where Blackstone Credit can bring its expertise and experience in negotiating and structuring. We believe that Blackstone Credit has the scale and platform to effectively manage a U.S. private credit investment strategy, offering investors the following potential strengths:
Ability to Provide Scale, Differentiated Capital Solutions. We believe that the breadth and scale of Blackstone Credit’s approximately $145 billion platform, as of December 31, 2020, and affiliation with Blackstone are distinct strengths when sourcing proprietary investment opportunities and provide Blackstone Credit with a differentiated capability to invest in large, complex opportunities. Blackstone Credit is invested in over 1,000 corporate issuers across its portfolios globally and has focused primarily on the non-investment grade corporate credit market since its inception in 2005. Blackstone Credit expects that in the current environment, in which committed capital from banks remains scarce (as tracked by S&P Capital IQ LCD, U.S. banks’ share of senior secured debt to middle market companies represented 12% of the overall middle market loan volume in 2019, down from nearly 20% in 2011), the ability to provide flexible, well-structured capital commitments in appropriate sizes will enable Blackstone Credit to command more favorable terms for its investments. Blackstone Credit believes that it occupies a differentiated position in the leveraged finance market, with investment activities that span a broad array of public and private market strategies. We believe this presence enables Blackstone Credit to identify opportunities early and select those investments that Blackstone Credit believes offer the most attractive risk-adjusted return profile. In addition, when banks are facing difficulties in syndicating new issues, Blackstone Credit’s ability to serve as a large “anchor” investor can help facilitate the successful completion of a transaction. We believe the depth of the experience of Blackstone Credit’s senior management team, together with the wider resources of Blackstone Credit’s team of investment professionals (the “Investment Team”), which is dedicated to sourcing, structuring, executing, monitoring and harvesting a broad range of private investments, is one of Blackstone Credit's key strengths when sourcing and analyzing what we believe to be attractive investment opportunities.
Established Origination Platform with Strong Credit Expertise. As of January 1, 2021, Blackstone Credit had an 82 person U.S. Direct Lending Investments and Portfolio Management Team (excluding Dwight Scott, a member of Blackstone Credit's senior management) focused on the sourcing, structuring, execution, management and realization of performing credit investments (which includes those professionals who focus primarily on direct lending investments). Performing credit investments are credit investments whose obligors are able to timely and fully pay interest on their outstanding debt, and are not financially stressed or distressed, or considered to be at substantial risk of being financially stressed or distressed, at the time of investment. We believe that Blackstone Credit’s strong reputation and longstanding relationships with corporate boards, management teams, leveraged buyout sponsors, financial advisors, and intermediaries position Blackstone Credit as a partner and counterparty of choice and provides us with attractive sourcing capabilities. In Blackstone Credit’s experience, these relationships help drive substantial proprietary deal flow and insight into investment opportunities.
Value-Added Capital Provider and Partner Leveraging the Blackstone Credit Advantage Program. Blackstone Credit has established a reputation for providing creative, value-added solutions to address a company’s financing requirements and believes our ability to “solve a problem” for a company can lead to attractive investment opportunities. In addition, Blackstone Credit has access to the significant resources of the Blackstone platform, including the Blackstone Credit Advantage Program, which is a global platform that provides access to a range of cost saving, revenue generating and best practice sharing opportunities. Specifically, Blackstone Credit Advantage provides (i) partnership and best practices for portfolio companies by offering invaluable access to industry and function experts both within the Blackstone organization (including the Blackstone Portfolio Operations team) and the network among portfolio companies; (ii) cross selling opportunities across Blackstone and Blackstone Credit portfolio companies; (iii) industry knowledge via leadership summits and roundtables; and (iv) quarterly reports sharing meaningful insights from CEOs on business and economic trends. Finally, one of the most important benefits of the program is Blackstone’s GPO, which is a collective purchasing platform that leverages the scale and buying power of the $5 billion of average annual spending of Blackstone’s portfolio companies with strategic partners and vendors measured over the past ten years. Blackstone and Blackstone Credit portfolio companies have generated significant cost savings through their use of the GPO, ranging from 3% to 40%, often from existing suppliers, on maintenance, repair, operations, back office, information technology, hardware, software, telecommunications, business insurance and human resources, among others. The 
7


benefits of working with Blackstone’s GPO can include improved pricing and terms, differentiated service, and ongoing service drops straight to the bottom line.
Blackstone Credit seeks to generate investment opportunities through its direct origination channels and through syndicate and club deals (generally, investments made by a small group of investment firms). With respect to Blackstone Credit’s origination channel, we seek to leverage the global presence of Blackstone Credit to generate access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with attractive investment characteristics. We believe that the broad network of Blackstone Credit provides a significant pipeline of investment opportunities for us. With respect to syndicate and club deals, Blackstone Credit has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. Blackstone Credit also has a significant trading platform, which, we believe, allows us access to the secondary market for investment opportunities.
Flexible Investment Approach. Blackstone Credit believes that the ability to invest opportunistically throughout a capital structure is a meaningful strength when sourcing transactions and enables the Company to seek investments that provide the best risk/return proposition in any given transaction.  Blackstone Credit’s creativity and flexibility with regard to deal-structuring distinguishes it from other financing sources, including traditional mezzanine providers, whose investment mandates are typically more restrictive.  Over time, Blackstone Credit has demonstrated the ability to negotiate more favorable terms for its investments by providing creative structures that add value for an issuer.  Blackstone Credit will continue to seek to use this flexible investment approach to focus on principal preservation, while generating attractive returns throughout different economic and market cycles.
Long-Term Investment Horizon. Our long-term investment horizon gives us great flexibility, which we believe allows us to maximize returns on our investments. Unlike most private equity and venture capital funds, as well as many private debt funds, we will not be required to return capital to our shareholders once we exit a portfolio investment. We believe that freedom from such capital return requirements, which allows us to invest using a long-term focus, provides us with an attractive opportunity to increase total returns on invested capital.
Disciplined Investment Process and Income-Oriented Investment Philosophy. Blackstone Credit employs a rigorous investment process and defensive investment approach to evaluate all potential opportunities with a focus on long-term credit performance and principal protection. We believe Blackstone Credit has generated attractive risk-adjusted returns in its investing activities throughout many economic and credit cycles by (i) maintaining its investment discipline; (ii) performing intensive credit work; (iii) carefully structuring transactions; and (iv) actively managing its portfolios. Blackstone Credit’s investment approach involves a multi-stage selection process for each investment opportunity, as well as ongoing monitoring of each investment made, with particular emphasis on early detection of deteriorating credit conditions at portfolio companies which would result in adverse portfolio developments. This strategy is designed to maximize current income and minimize the risk of capital loss while maintaining the potential for long-term capital appreciation. Additionally, Blackstone Credit’s senior investment professionals have dedicated their careers to the leveraged finance and private equity sectors and we believe that their experience in due diligence, credit analysis and ongoing management of investments is invaluable to the success of the U.S. direct lending investment strategy that we will employ. Blackstone Credit targets businesses with leading market share positions, sustainable barriers to entry, high free cash flow generation, strong asset values, liquidity to withstand market cycles, favorable underlying industry trends, strong internal controls and high-quality management teams.
Strong Investment Track Record. Blackstone Credit’s track record in private debt lending and investing in below investment grade credit dates back to the inception of Blackstone Credit. Since 2005, Blackstone Credit has provided approximately $69 billion in capital in privately-originated transactions with over 120 different sponsors, through various funds and accounts advised or sub-advised by Blackstone Credit. As it relates to the U.S. direct lending strategy, Blackstone Credit has been originating in the strategy since inception, and has invested approximately $28 billion of capital specifically in U.S. middle market privately originated and anchor loans. Blackstone Credit has approximately $97 billion of investor capital invested.
Investment Strategy
Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We seek to meet our investment objectives by:
•utilizing the experience and expertise of the management team of the Adviser, along with the broader resources of Blackstone Credit, which include its access to the relationships and human capital of Blackstone 
8


Credit’s parent, Blackstone, in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions, subject to Blackstone’s policies and procedures regarding the management of conflicts of interest;
•employing a defensive investment approach focused on long-term credit performance and principal protection, generally lending on a basis of 3.5 times to 5.5 times the borrower’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) (which is generally measured on a forward basis using estimated projections of the Adviser and may include certain adjustments) and at loan-to-value ratios of 50%-65% (with value being the Adviser’s estimate of enterprise value of the borrower) and also seeking favorable financial covenant protections.  The methodology for calculating enterprise value can vary by company and industry, but would typically be based on (i) observable market prices for the company’s debt and equity securities (when available), (ii) comparable company analysis, or (iii) discounted cash flow analysis; 
•focusing primarily on loans and securities of private U.S. companies, including syndicated loans, specifically small and middle market companies, which we define as companies with annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion, at the time of investment. Specifically, for our originated investments, we target companies with $25 million to $75 million of EBITDA. In many market environments, we believe such a focus offers an opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns;
•investing primarily in established, stable enterprises with positive cash flows; and
•maintaining rigorous portfolio monitoring in an attempt to anticipate and pre-empt negative credit events within our portfolio.
Under normal market conditions, we generally invest at least 80% of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in secured debt investments (including investments that are secured by equity interests). Our portfolio is composed primarily of first lien senior secured and unitranche loans (including first out/last out loans), generally with total investment sizes less than $300 million, which criteria may change from time to time. To a lesser extent, we have and may continue to also invest in second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, generally with total investment sizes less than $100 million, which criteria may change from time to time, and other debt and equity securities. We do not currently focus on investments in issuers that are distressed or in need of rescue financing.  Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other Blackstone Credit funds.
Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be composed of second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest, subject to compliance with our 80% policy. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the “over-the-counter” market or directly from our target companies as primary market, directly originated or syndicated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We have and may continue to also purchase or otherwise acquire minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for our common shares of beneficial interest or other equity or the cash value of shares or other equity, in our target companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm, or a finance company transaction (such as a joint venture). In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be composed of unsecured bonds, CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments.
Investment Selection
When identifying prospective investment opportunities, the Adviser currently intends to rely on fundamental credit analysis in order to minimize the loss of the Company’s capital. The Adviser expects to invest in companies possessing the following attributes, which it believes will help achieve our investment objective:
Leading, Defensible Market Positions. The Adviser intends to invest in companies that it believes have developed strong positions within their respective markets and exhibit the potential to maintain sufficient cash flows and profitability to service their obligations in a range of economic environments. The Adviser will seek companies that it believes possess advantages in scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing, or product quality versus their competitors, thereby minimizing business risk and protecting profitability.
9


Stable Companies with Positive Cash Flow. The Adviser intends to invest in established, stable companies which have demonstrated a record of profitability and cash flows over several economic cycles. The Adviser believes such companies are well-positioned to maintain consistent cash flow to service and repay their obligations and maintain growth in their businesses or market share. The Adviser does not intend to invest in start-up companies, companies in turnaround situations or companies with speculative business plans.
Proven Management Teams. The Adviser focuses on investments in which the target company has an experienced and high-quality management team with an established track record of success. The Adviser typically requires companies to have in place proper incentives to align management’s goals with the Company’s goals.
Private Equity Sponsorship. Often the Adviser seeks to participate in transactions sponsored by what it believes to be high-quality private equity firms. The Adviser believes that a private equity sponsor’s willingness to invest significant sums of equity capital into a company is an implicit endorsement of the quality of the investment. Further, private equity sponsors of companies with significant investments at risk generally have the ability and a strong incentive to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should operational issues arise, which could provide additional protections for our investments.
Diversification. The Adviser seeks to invest broadly among companies and industries, thereby potentially reducing the risk of a downturn in any one company or industry having a disproportionate impact on the value of the Company’s portfolio.
Viable Exit Strategy. In addition to payments of principal and interest, we expect the primary methods for the strategy to realize returns on our investments include refinancings, sales of portfolio companies, and in some cases initial public offerings and secondary offerings. While many debt instruments in which we will invest have stated maturities of five to eight years, we expect the majority to be redeemed or sold prior to maturity.  These instruments often have call protection that requires an issuer to pay a premium if it redeems in the early years of an investment. The Investment Team regularly reviews investments and related market conditions in order to determine if an opportunity exists to realize returns on a particular investment.  We believe the ability to utilize the entire resources of Blackstone Credit, including the public market traders and research analysts, allows the Adviser to gain access to current market information where the opportunity may exist to sell positions into the market at attractive prices.
Investment Process Overview
Our investment activities are managed by our Adviser. The Adviser is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.
The investment professionals employed by Blackstone Credit have spent their careers developing the resources necessary to invest in private companies. Our transaction process is highlighted below.
Sourcing and Origination
In order to source transactions, the Adviser utilizes its significant access to transaction flow, along with its trading platform. The Adviser seeks to generate investment opportunities primarily through direct origination channels, and also through syndicate and club deals. With respect to Blackstone Credit’s origination channel, the global presence of Blackstone Credit generates access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with what we believe to be attractive investment characteristics. With respect to syndicate and club deals, Blackstone Credit has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. We believe that Blackstone Credit’s strong reputation and longstanding relationships with its broad network will help drive substantial proprietary deal flow and provide a significant pipeline of investment opportunities for us.
Evaluation
Initial Review.  The Investment Team examines information furnished by the target company and external sources, including banks, advisors and rating agencies, if applicable, to determine whether the investment meets our basic investment criteria within the context of proper allocation of our portfolio among various issuers and industries, and offers an acceptable 
10


probability of attractive returns with identifiable downside risk. In the case of directly originated transactions, Blackstone Credit conducts detailed due diligence investigations. For the majority of securities available on the secondary market, a comprehensive analysis is conducted and continuously maintained by a dedicated Blackstone Credit research analyst, the results of which are available for the transaction team to review.
Credit Analysis/Due Diligence. Before undertaking an investment, the Investment Team conducts a thorough and rigorous due diligence review of the opportunity to ensure the company fits our investment strategy, which may include: 
•a full operational analysis to identify the key risks and opportunities of the target’s business, including a detailed review of historical and projected financial results;
•a detailed analysis of industry and customer dynamics, competitive position, regulatory, tax and legal matters;
•on-site visits and customer and supplier reference calls, if deemed necessary;
•background checks to further evaluate management and other key personnel;
•a review by legal and accounting professionals, environmental or other industry consultants, if necessary;
•financial sponsor due diligence, including portfolio company and lender reference checks, if necessary; and
•a review of management’s experience and track record.
Third parties are often involved in the Adviser’s due diligence process, whether they are hired by the Adviser or by the lead sponsor in a transaction. Utilizing consultants to help evaluate a business and test an investment thesis is typically very beneficial. When possible, the Adviser seeks to structure transactions in such a way that our target companies are required to bear the costs of due diligence, including those costs related to any outside consulting work we may require.
The foregoing initial assessment is then followed by extensive credit analysis, including asset valuation, financial analysis, cash flow analysis and scenario analysis, legal and accounting review, and comparable credit and equity analyses. A thorough assessment of structure and leverage of a transaction and how the particular investment fits into the overall investment strategy of the portfolio is conducted. Blackstone Credit’s typical diligence process for an originated investment opportunity spans two to six months, from the initial screen through final approval and funding.  Depending on the deal, each investment team typically consists of three to four investment professionals, consisting of a portfolio manager, managing director, principal or vice president and associate and/or analyst.
Blackstone Credit’s due diligence emphasizes the following key criteria to facilitate decisions by the Investment Committee (described below) on an investment:
•Valuation: What is the intrinsic value of the business? How has the business historically generated returns on capital? Will these returns continue in the future? What growth opportunities does the business have, if any? And, most importantly, is the investment being purchased at a deep discount to long-term intrinsic value?
•Return Hurdles: Is the investment expected to generate a rate of return that meets the Company's objectives?
•Risk of Principal Loss & Risk/Reward: What is the expected recovery in a severe downside case? Does the expected upside appropriately compensate for risk of loss?
•Company Analysis: Does the business have a reason to exist? Does it provide needed products and services? Does it have strong business characteristics such as high relative market share and a defensible niche?
•Industry Analysis: What is the expected time and depth of cyclical downturn? Is the distress related to cyclical or secular issues? Is there a favorable industry structure with respect to customers, suppliers and regulation?
•Due Diligence: Do we have sufficient information to make an informed investment decision? 
11


•Catalyst: What steps are required to complete a reorganization, eliminate financial distress, gain control and implement improved business strategies?
•Exit Plan: Do we expect refinancings, a sale of the company, or other exit opportunities?
Investment Committee Process. The Investment Committee review process is multi-step and iterative, and occurs in parallel with the diligence and structuring of investments. The initial investment screening process involves an Investment Committee heads-up (the “Heads-Up”) review presentation by the portfolio manager and members of the investment team. The Heads-Up review involves the production of a short memo with a focus on the following diligence items: an early diligence review of the underlying business fundamentals; expected return potential; expected investment size; assessment of key risks; and an appropriate initial diligence plan. At this point in the decision-making process, the Investment Committee will decide whether or not the Investment Team should proceed with deeper diligence on the investment opportunity.
Once in-depth diligence has begun, the investment team presents updates at the weekly Investment Committee meetings. The senior team reviews all activity for the prior week, with a focus on detailed updates of ongoing situations and in-depth review of all new investment opportunities. The type of diligence materials reviewed at these meetings for each company may include, but are not limited to:
•Detailed historical financial performance
•Financial models with detailed revenue drivers 
◦This includes the construction of a base case, a downside case and specifically tailored cases.  This process includes probability-weighted analysis and a range of outcomes analysis.
•Quarterly liquidity analyses
•Industry analysis incorporating internal and external work from research analysts and industry consultants
•Competitive position and market share analysis
•Customer analysis, including revenue, profitability and concentration risk
•Pricing and volume analyses
•Detailed fixed vs. variable cost analysis, and line item analysis of cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative expenses
•Public and private credit and equity comparable analysis
•Accounting quality of earnings analysis
•Legal due diligence
The ultimate results and findings of the investment analysis are compiled in comprehensive investment memoranda that are used as the basis to support the investment thesis and are utilized by the Investment Committee for final investment review and approval.  Each investment requires the consent of the Investment Committee, which may emphasize the following key criteria (among others) in making a decision:
•Company Analysis:  Does the company meet the investment criteria defined by the “Blackstone Credit Scorecard”?:
◦Leading market share position
◦Sustainable barriers to entry that drive pricing power
◦High-quality management team
◦Stable financials: strong free cash flow generation, high earnings before interest and tax margins
◦Conservative capital structure with underlying equity value
◦Liquidity to withstand market cycles
12


•Industry Analysis: Is there a favorable industry structure with respect to customers, suppliers and regulation?
•Due Diligence: Have we fully diligenced each of the investment criteria specified by the Blackstone Credit Scorecard? Have we completely vetted each of the risk factors identified throughout the diligence and Investment Committee process?
•Valuation:  What is the intrinsic value of the business?  How has the business historically generated returns on capital?  Will these returns continue in the future?  What growth opportunities does the business have, if any?  Is there substantial equity value to support the capital structure?
•Risk of Principal Loss & Risk/Reward:  What is the expected recovery in a severe downside case?  Does the expected upside appropriately compensate for risk of loss?
•Return Hurdles:  Is the investment expected to generate a rate of return that meets the Company’s objectives?
•Exit Plan: Do we expect refinancings, a sale of the company, or other exit opportunities?
The Investment Committee utilizes a consensus-driven approach and currently consists of the following senior investment professionals: Dwight Scott, Brad Marshall, Steve Kuppenheimer, Rob Zable, Michael Zawadzki, Dan Smith, Rob Horn, Rob Petrini, Louis Salvatore and Paulo Eapen. Others who participate in the Investment Committee process include the members of the Investment Team responsible for sourcing, analyzing and conducting due diligence on the investment and other senior members of Blackstone Credit. There are no representatives from other business groups of Blackstone involved in the Company’s Investment Committee process.
Monitoring
Portfolio Monitoring. Active management of our investments is performed by the team responsible for making the initial investment.  The Adviser believes that actively managing an investment allows the Investment Team to identify problems early and work with companies to develop constructive solutions when necessary. The Adviser will monitor our portfolio with a focus toward anticipating negative credit events. In seeking to maintain portfolio company performance and help to ensure a successful exit, the Adviser will work closely with, as applicable, the lead equity sponsor, loan syndicator, portfolio company management, consultants, advisers and other security holders to discuss financial position, compliance with covenants, financial requirements and execution of the company’s business plan. In addition, depending on the size, nature and performance of the transaction, we may occupy a seat or serve as an observer on a portfolio company’s board of directors or similar governing body.
Watch List. Typically for its portfolio companies, Blackstone Credit establishes at closing a number of reporting and management tools. These tools include regular reporting on portfolio composition and reporting, calls with CEOs and detailed reports and calls with senior management on a regular basis, and quarterly in-person board meetings and board presentations. All reports and presentations are designed with Blackstone Credit input based on its past experience with private investments. These tools allow Blackstone Credit to identify problems quickly and work to fix them before they impair an investment. In addition, Blackstone Credit maintains a “watch list” for each business under-performing its expectations. Blackstone Credit seeks to approach each situation with the view that working closely with senior management and the shareholders of the company on strategies to remedy problems will ultimately maximize value realization. When, in order to maximize our recovery, Blackstone Credit is forced to take positions inconsistent with the company’s shareholders, Blackstone Credit expects to act quickly to enforce its rights.
Blackstone Credit strives to position itself to be able to identify and manage the process surrounding a troubled portfolio company. When companies under-perform, Blackstone Credit generally increases its involvement in the business and works closely with senior management to develop plans to help get performance on track. Blackstone Credit will request more information and will enhance our information quality so that we are aware of any developments. Blackstone Credit’s Investment Committee process is designed to identify red flags of a potential opportunity early and to leverage the collective knowledge of its prior experiences. Blackstone Credit believes that vetting all investments through its Investment Committee, which has deep expertise across industries, differentiates Blackstone Credit and can help it avoid mistakes. Additionally, Blackstone Credit may provide guidance on key management hires or supplement the portfolio company’s board with relevant industry people that Blackstone Credit has worked with previously to engage more deeply in the operations of a portfolio company. Additionally, the GPO team can be leveraged to help reduce costs and augment key leadership positions.
13


Default/Workout. An important element of Blackstone Credit’s strategy is to attempt to structure investments in a manner such that Blackstone Credit will control negotiations should an issuer violate covenants or need to restructure its balance sheet. Blackstone Credit believes that this is typically achieved by ensuring that an investment is at or above the “fulcrum” security, if a restructuring were to occur. A fulcrum security is the security in a company’s capital structure that, if the company were to be liquidated, would be partially repaid. Generally, securities more senior than the fulcrum security would typically be fully repaid in such a liquidation and securities more junior than the fulcrum security would typically receive no recovery in a liquidation. If an investment should default, Blackstone Credit believes it has ample resources necessary to take a company through a restructuring, as many of its investment professionals have restructuring backgrounds.
The Blackstone Credit deal team, along with other creditors and outside counsel, will be responsible for monitoring any defaulting portfolio companies and driving the restructuring processes thereafter. The same Investment Team members who originate an investment remain actively involved, from sourcing through diligence, execution and ongoing management all the way to exit. In the case that an investment requires a heavy workout that results in a board seat and more operational involvement, Blackstone Credit may dedicate or add a senior investment professional to solely focus on the workout situation. This individual will get involved and run the full workout process to allow the other deal team members to focus on new origination and other portfolio companies. Any investment undergoing a workout will also be discussed with portfolio management and the Investment Committee on a regular basis.
Valuation Process. Each quarter, we will value investments in our portfolio, and such values will be disclosed each quarter in reports filed with the SEC. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, a valuation committee appointed by the Board of Trustees will assist the Board of Trustees in determining the fair value of such investments in good faith, based on procedures adopted by and subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees.
We will also determine our NAV as of the last day of a month that is not also the last day of a calendar quarter and we intend to update the value of securities with reliable market quotations to the most recent market quotation. For securities without reliable market quotations, the Adviser’s valuation team will generally value such assets at the most recent quarterly valuation unless the Adviser determines that a significant observable change has occurred since the most recent quarter end with respect to the investment (which determination may be as a result of a material event at a portfolio company, material change in market spreads, secondary market transaction in the securities of an investment or otherwise). Investments for which market quotations are readily available are recorded at such market quotations.
Managerial Assistance. As a BDC, we must offer, and provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies except where the Company purchases securities of an issuer in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance, including through the Blackstone Credit Advantage program. The Adviser and the Administrator will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. To the extent fees are paid for these services, we, rather than the Adviser, will retain any fees paid for such assistance.
Exit
In addition to payments of principal and interest, we expect the primary methods for the strategy to realize returns on its investments include refinancings, sales of portfolio companies, and in some cases initial public offerings and secondary offerings. While many debt securities in which we will invest have stated maturities of five to eight years, based on Blackstone Credit’s past experience, we believe most of these securities will be redeemed or sold prior to maturity.  These securities often have call protection that requires an issuer to pay a premium if it redeems in the early years of an investment. However, there is no assurance that our investments will achieve realization events as a result of refinancings, sales of portfolio companies or public offerings and these realization events will become more unlikely when conditions in the loan and capital markets have deteriorated.
The Investment Team regularly reviews investments and related market conditions in order to determine if an opportunity exists to realize returns on a particular investment.  We believe the Adviser’s ability to utilize the entire resources of Blackstone Credit, including the public market traders and research analysts, allows the Adviser to gain access to current market information where the opportunity may exist to sell positions into the market at attractive prices.
Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interest
14


Blackstone Credit, including the Adviser, provides investment management services to other registered investment companies, investment funds, client accounts and proprietary accounts that Blackstone Credit may establish (other than the Company) (collectively the “Other Blackstone Credit Clients”). In addition, Blackstone provides investment management services to other registered investment companies, investment funds, client accounts and proprietary accounts that Blackstone may establish (together with the Other Blackstone Credit Clients, the “Other Clients”).  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Adviser and Its Affiliates; Conflicts of Interest—There may be conflicts of interest related to obligations that the Adviser’s senior management and Investment Team have to other clients.”
Blackstone Credit will share any investment and sale opportunities with its other clients and the Company in accordance with the Advisers Act and firm-wide allocation policies, which generally provide for sharing pro rata based on targeted acquisition size or targeted sale size. Subject to the Advisers Act and as further set forth in the prospectus, certain other clients may receive certain priority or other allocation rights with respect to certain investments, subject to various conditions set forth in such other clients’ respective governing agreements.
In addition, as a BDC regulated under the 1940 Act, the Company is subject to certain limitations relating to co-investments and joint transactions with affiliates, which likely in certain circumstances limit the Company’s ability to make investments or enter into other transactions alongside other clients.
Co-Investment Relief
We have in the past co-invested, and in the future may co-invest, with certain affiliates of the Adviser. We have received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that permits us, among other things, to co-invest with certain other persons, including certain affiliates of the Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Adviser and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions. Pursuant to such order, the board of trustees of the Company (the “Board”) has established objective criteria (“Board Criteria”) clearly defining co-investment opportunities in which the Company will have the opportunity to participate with one or more listed or private Blackstone Credit-managed BDCs (including the Company, the “Blackstone Credit BDCs”), and other public or private Blackstone Credit funds that target similar assets. If an investment falls within the Board Criteria, Blackstone Credit must offer an opportunity for the Blackstone Credit BDCs to participate.  The Blackstone Credit BDCs may determine to participate or not to participate, depending on whether Blackstone Credit determines that the investment is appropriate for the Blackstone Credit BDCs (e.g., based on investment strategy).  The co-investment would generally be allocated to us, any other Blackstone Credit BDCs and the other Blackstone Credit funds that target similar assets pro rata based on available capital in the applicable asset class.  If the Adviser determines that such investment is not appropriate for us, the investment will not be allocated to us, but the Adviser will be required to report such investment and the rationale for its determination for us to not participate in the investment to the Board at the next quarterly board meeting.

See the Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019  in our consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Consolidated Schedule of Investments” for more information on these investments.
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had outstanding commitments to fund delayed draw term loans totaling $432.3 million and $179.4 million, respectively.
Capital Resources and Borrowings
As a RIC, we intend to distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders. We anticipate generating cash in the future from the issuance of shares and cash flows from operations, including interest received on our debt investments.
Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our shares if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our asset coverage was 230.0% and 215.1%, respectively.
Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must take provisions to prohibit any distribution to our shareholders (which may cause us to fail to distribute amounts necessary to avoid entity-level taxation under the Code), or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In addition, we must also comply with positive and negative covenants customary for these types of facilities. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Warehousing Transactions
We entered into two warehousing transactions whereby we agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase certain assets from parties unaffiliated with the Adviser. Such warehousing transactions were designed to assist us in deploying capital upon receipt of drawdown proceeds. One of these warehousing transactions related primarily to originated or anchor investments in middle market loans (the “Middle Market Warehouse”).  The other warehouse related primarily to broadly syndicated loans (the “Syndicated Warehouse” and, together with the Middle Market Warehouse, the “Warehousing Transactions”) prior to the acquisition of the equity interests of the Syndicated Warehouse by us and merger of the Syndicated Warehouse with our wholly-owned subsidiary, as described below. Both the Middle Market Warehouse and the Syndicated Warehouse have been terminated.

Investment Advisory Agreement
The Adviser provides management services to us pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Investment Advisory Agreement has been approved by the Board.  Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for the following:
•determining the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes in accordance with our investment objective, policies and restrictions;
•identifying investment opportunities and making investment decisions for us, including negotiating the terms of investments in, and dispositions of, portfolio securities and other instruments on our behalf;
•monitoring our investments;
•performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies;
•exercising voting rights in respect of portfolio securities and other investments for us;
•serving on, and exercising observer rights for, boards of directors and similar committees of our portfolio companies;
•negotiating, obtaining and managing financing facilities and other forms of leverage; and
•providing us with such other investment advisory and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of capital.
The Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities, and it intends to do so, so long as its services to us are not impaired.
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay our Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components—a management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the shareholders.
Management Fee
The management fee is payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of (i) prior to an Exchange Listing, 0.75%, and (ii) following an Exchange Listing, 1.0%, in each case of the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. For the first calendar quarter in which the Company had operations, gross assets were measured as the average of gross assets at the Initial Drawdown Date (as defined below) and at the end of such first calendar quarter. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, "gross assets" means our total assets determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), excluding undrawn commitments but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts. If an Exchange Listing occurs on a date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the management fee shall be calculated for such calendar quarter at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after the Exchange Listing based on the number of days in such calendar quarter before and after the Exchange Listing.
Incentive Fee
The incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of our income and a portion is based on a percentage of our capital gains, each as described below.
(i) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
The portion based on our income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns” means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement entered into between us and the Administrator (the “Administration Agreement”), and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee).
18


Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind (“PIK”) interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The Company excludes the impact of expense support payments and recoupments from pre-incentive fee net investment income.
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, is compared to a “hurdle rate” of return of 1.5% per quarter (6.0% annualized).
Prior to an Exchange Listing, we pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows:
•no incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.5%;
•100% of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.76% (7.06% annualized). We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.76%) as the “catch-up.” The “catch-up” is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately 15% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 1.76% in any calendar quarter; and
•15% of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.76% (7.06% annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 15% of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser.

(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)
Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
Allocated to Quarterly Incentive Fee
Following an Exchange Listing, we will pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows:
•no incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.5%;
•100% of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.82% (7.27% annualized). The “catch-up” is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately 17.5% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 1.82% in any calendar quarter; and
•17.5% of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.82% (7.27% annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 17.5% of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser.

(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
Allocated to Quarterly Incentive Fee
These calculations are prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a calendar quarter in which we incur an overall loss taking into account capital account losses. For example, if we receive Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in excess of the quarterly hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that calendar quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. If an Exchange Listing occurs on a date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the incentive fee shall be calculated for such calendar quarter at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after the Exchange Listing based on the number of days in such calendar quarter before and after the Exchange Listing.
(ii) Incentive Fee on Capital Gains
The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year (or at the time of an Exchange Listing) in arrears.
Prior to an Exchange Listing, the amount payable equals:
•15% of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year (or upon an Exchange Listing), computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Following an Exchange Listing, the amount payable equals:
•17.5% of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
If an Exchange Listing occurs on a date other than the first day of a fiscal year, a capital gains incentive fee shall be calculated as of the day before the Exchange Listing, with such capital gains incentive fee paid to the Adviser following the end of the fiscal year in which the Exchange Listing occurred. For the avoidance of doubt, such capital gains incentive fee shall be equal to 15% of our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through the day before the Exchange Listing, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. Solely for purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee after an Exchange Listing, the Company will be deemed to have previously paid capital gains incentive fees prior to an Exchange Listing equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the actual aggregate amount of previously paid capital gains incentive fees for all periods prior to an Exchange Listing by (b) the percentage obtained by dividing (x) 17.5% by (y) 15%.
Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for all prior periods. We will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if we were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), including Section 205 thereof.
The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period are appropriately prorated.

Administration Agreement
Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator will provide, or oversee the performance of, administrative and compliance services, including, but not limited to, maintaining financial records, overseeing the calculation of net asset value (“NAV”), compliance monitoring (including diligence and oversight of our other service providers),  preparing reports to shareholders and reports filed with the SEC, preparing materials and coordinating meetings of our Board, managing the payment of expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others and providing office space, equipment and office services. We will reimburse the Administrator for its costs, expenses and allocable portion of overhead (including compensation of personnel performing administrative duties) in connection with the services performed for us pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we will reimburse the Administrator for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party. The Administrator has hired a sub-administrator to assist in the provision of administrative services. The sub-administrator receives compensation for its provision of sub-administrative services under a sub-administration agreement.
Certain Terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement
Each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement has been approved by the Board.  Unless earlier terminated as described below, each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from the date it first became effective and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the independent trustees. We may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement or the Administration Agreement, without payment of any penalty, upon 60 days’ written notice.  The decision to terminate either agreement may be made by a majority of the Board or the shareholders holding a majority outstanding voting securities, which means the lesser of (1) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company.  In addition, the Adviser may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement or the Administrator may terminate the Administration Agreement, without payment of any penalty, upon 60 days’ written notice.  The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations in the event of its assignment.
The Adviser and the Administrator shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission or any loss suffered by the Company in connection with the matters to which the Investment Advisory Agreement  and Administration Agreement, respectively, relate, provided that the Adviser and Administrator shall not be protected against any liability to the Company or its shareholders to which the Adviser or Administrator would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations (“disabling conduct”). Each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement provides that, absent disabling conduct, each of our Adviser and our Administrator, as applicable, and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administrator’s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as adviser or administrator for us. The Adviser and the Administrator shall not be liable under their respective agreements with us or otherwise for any loss due to the mistake, action, inaction, negligence, dishonesty, fraud or bad faith of any broker or other agent; provided, that such broker or other agent shall have been selected, engaged or retained and monitored by the Adviser or the Administrator in good faith, unless such action or inaction was made by reason of disabling conduct, or in the case of a criminal action or proceeding, where the Adviser or Administrator had reasonable cause to believe its conduct was unlawful.
Expense Support
On December 12, 2018, we entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the “Expense Support Agreement”) with the Adviser.  The Expense Support Agreement provides that, at such times as the Adviser determines, the Adviser may pay certain expenses of the Company, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any of our interest expense (each, an “Expense Payment”). Such Expense Payment must be made in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after a written commitment from the Adviser to pay such expense, and/or by an offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar quarter in which Available Operating Funds (as defined in the Expense Support Agreement) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to our shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar quarter (such amount referred to as the “Excess Operating Funds”), we shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof (each, a 
21


“Reimbursement Payment”), to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed. The amount of the Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter shall equal the lesser of (i) the Excess Operating Funds in such quarter and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to us within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter that have not been previously reimbursed by us to the Adviser. The Expense Support Agreement provides additional restrictions on the amount of each Reimbursement Payment for any calendar quarter. The Adviser may waive its right to receive all or a portion of any Reimbursement Payment in any particular calendar quarter, so that such Reimbursement Payment may be reimbursable in a future calendar quarter.
Distributions
We generally intend to distribute substantially all of our available earnings annually by paying distributions on a quarterly basis, as determined by the Board in its discretion. We cannot assure investors that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions (particularly during the early stages of our operations) or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. We anticipate that our distributions will generally be paid from post-offering taxable earnings, including interest and capital gains generated by our investment portfolio, and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees, that we receive from portfolio companies. However, if we do not generate sufficient taxable earnings during a year, all or part of a distribution may constitute a return of capital. The specific tax characteristics of our dividends and other distributions are reported to shareholders after the end of each calendar year.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we reinvest all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of our shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our shareholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder’s account to three decimal places.
Prior to an Exchange Listing, a participating shareholder will receive an amount of shares equal to the amount of the distribution on that participant’s shares divided by the most recent fiscal quarter-end NAV per share that is available on the date such distribution was paid (unless the Board determines to use the NAV per share as of another time).
Following an Exchange Listing, a participating shareholder will receive an amount of shares equal to the amount of the distribution on that participant’s shares divided by the market price per share at the close of regular trading on the applicable stock exchange on the date of such distribution, subject to certain adjustments described in the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan.
We intend to use newly issued shares to implement the plan. Shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan will not reduce outstanding Capital Commitments.
No action is required on the part of a registered shareholder to have his, her or its cash dividend or other distribution reinvested in our shares. Shareholders can elect to “opt out” of the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan in their Subscription Agreements.  A shareholder may elect to receive its entire dividend in cash at any time by notifying the Company’s transfer agent in writing. If, however, a shareholder requests to change its election within 95 days prior to a distribution, the request will be effective only with respect to distributions after the 95-day period.
There are no brokerage charges or other charges to shareholders who participate in the plan.
The Board may amend or supplement the terms of the dividend reinvestment plan at any time without shareholder approval.  The plan may be terminated by the Company at any time upon notice in writing mailed to each shareholder of record.
Our Private Offering
We are conducting a private offering (the “Private Offering”) of shares (i) to accredited investors (as defined in Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”)) and (ii) in the case of shares sold outside the United States, to persons that are not “U.S. persons” (as defined in Regulation S under the 1933 Act), in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. Shares will be offered for subscription continuously throughout the period 
22


during which the Private Offering remains open.  Shares will be offered for subscription continuously throughout the Initial Closing Period (as defined below) and may be offered from time to time thereafter.  At each closing of the Private Offering, each investor participating in that closing will make a capital commitment (a “Capital Commitment”) to purchase our shares pursuant to a subscription agreement relating to the shares (the “Subscription Agreement”). Investors will be required to fund drawdowns to purchase our shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitments on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a notice to the investors.
We expect closings of the Private Offering will occur, from time to time, in the Adviser’s sole discretion, during the two-year period following the initial closing of Capital Commitments (which initial closing took place on October 31, 2018) (the “Initial Closing Period”). On October 31, 2020, the Initial Closing Period ended. 
After the Initial Closing Period, we may permit one or more additional closings (“Subsequent Closings”) as additional Capital Commitments are obtained.  We currently do not expect to draw any Capital Commitments from Subsequent Closings (“Subsequent Capital Commitments”) until 100% of the Capital Commitments from the Initial Closing Period (“Initial Capital Commitments”) have been drawn down, unless otherwise determined by our Board.
We commenced our loan origination and investment activities contemporaneously with the receipt of the initial drawdown from investors in the Private Offering (the “Initial Drawdown”) on November 20, 2018.  The proceeds from the Initial Drawdown and borrowings from our credit facilities provided us with the necessary capital to commence operations.  See “—Credit Facilities.” We anticipate raising additional equity capital for investment purposes through additional closings under the Private Offering.
We have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into separate Subscription Agreements with a number of investors providing for the private placement of shares pursuant to the Private Offering and may enter into additional Subscription Agreements from time to time. We deliver drawdown requests at least ten business days prior to the required funding date. For Initial Capital Commitments, purchases of our shares are generally made first by holders with the largest percentage of their Initial Capital Commitments undrawn and then, once all holders have the same percentage of undrawn Initial Capital Commitments outstanding, pro rata in accordance with remaining Initial Capital Commitments of all investors.
The offering price per share at the Initial Drawdown Date was $25. Following the Initial Drawdown Date, shares have been and will be offered on a private placement basis at a price based on our NAV per share, which is approved by our Board and at all times consistent with U.S. GAAP. Each offering has been and will be subject to the limitations of Section 23(b) under the 1940 Act (which generally prohibits us from issuing shares at a price below the then-current NAV of the shares as determined within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays, of such issuance (taking into account any investment valuation adjustments from the latest quarterly valuation date in accordance with the Company’s valuation policy), subject to certain exceptions). In order to more fairly allocate organizational expenses among all shareholders, investors subscribing after the Initial Drawdown Date will be required to bear a pro rata portion of such expenses at the time of their first investment in the Company.
The “Initial Drawdown Period” began when Initial Capital Commitments were made and will continue until the earlier of (i) an Exchange Listing (as defined below) and (ii) the two-year anniversary of the end of the Initial Closing Period. During the Initial Drawdown Period and any drawdown period applicable to Subsequent Capital Commitments, the Adviser may issue capital calls for any permitted Company purpose. Subject to the share repurchase program described herein, the Company generally does not intend to return any drawn capital.
Key Person Event
A “Key Person Event” will occur if, during the Initial Drawdown Period, fewer than five of Bennett Goodman, Dwight Scott, Brad Marshall, Louis Salvatore, Rob Petrini, Dan Smith and Robert Zable, or their respective Qualified Replacements (as defined below) (such persons collectively, the “Key Persons”), are actively involved in and devoting sufficient time to the business and affairs of the Company as deemed reasonably necessary by the Adviser. Upon the occurrence of a Key Person Event, the Company will send written notice of the Key Person Event to the shareholders within ten business days of such occurrence. 
If during the forty-five day period following the sending of such written notice (the “Notice Period”) the Key Persons (who are the subject of such Key Person Event) have not been replaced by the Adviser with a Qualified Replacement (as defined below), the Company shall convene a meeting of the Company’s independent trustees to be held no later than thirty days following the expiration of the Notice Period for the purpose of determining whether the Initial Drawdown Period shall be continued (the “Key Person Meeting”).
23


If a majority of the independent trustees vote in favor of the proposal, the Initial Drawdown Period will be continued and shareholders will be obligated to fund drawdowns as if a Key Person Event had never occurred. Otherwise, the Initial Drawdown Period shall be deemed to have terminated as of the date of the Key Person Meeting, except that further drawdowns may be made to fund any proposed investment (including any follow-on investment and investments pursuant to an investment commitment) for which the Adviser has, on behalf of the Company, made a commitment, placed a bid (whether binding or not) in a competitive bidding situation or entered into a letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding or other similar document (whether or not such document created a legally binding obligation to proceed with such investment) or a definitive agreement to proceed with such transaction (collectively, “Actively Pursued Potential Investments”) if such Actively Pursued Potential Investment was being actively pursued as of such Key Person Event.
“Qualified Replacement” shall mean a senior investment professional selected by the Adviser; provided that such replacement has been approved by either (i) a majority of the independent trustees or (ii) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company, and upon either such approval, such nominee shall constitute a Qualified Replacement.
While we expect most Subscription Agreements to reflect the terms and conditions summarized in the preceding paragraph, we reserve the right to enter into Subscription Agreements or other agreements that contain terms and conditions not found in the Subscription Agreements or other agreements entered into with other investors, subject to applicable law.
Term
We currently expect to consummate an Exchange Listing by the four-year anniversary of the end of the Initial Closing Period, subject to market conditions. If we have not consummated an Exchange Listing by the earlier of (i) the five-year anniversary of the end of the Initial Drawdown Period, as may be extended for up to an additional one-year period pursuant to the Adviser’s recommendation with the approval of the Board and (ii) the ten year anniversary following the date of the initial closing, then, the Board (subject to market conditions and any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the 1940 Act) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to wind down, sell and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company in an orderly manner.
An “Exchange Listing” is a quotation or listing of the Company’s securities on a national securities exchange (including through an initial public offering) or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets to, or a merger or other liquidity transaction with, an entity in which the Company’s shareholders receive shares of a publicly-traded company which continues to be managed by the Adviser or an affiliate thereof.
Prior to an Exchange Listing, if the Board determines that there has been a significant adverse change in the regulatory or tax treatment of the Company or our shareholders that in its judgment makes it inadvisable for the Company to continue in its present form, then the Board will endeavor to restructure or change the form of the Company to preserve (insofar as possible) the overall benefits previously enjoyed by our shareholders as a whole or, if the Board determines it appropriate (and subject to any necessary shareholders approvals and applicable requirements of the 1940 Act), (i) cause the Company to change its form and/or jurisdiction of organization or (ii) wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company. The Board may also seek to change our form and/or jurisdiction of organization for other reasons. The Board may, at any time and in its discretion, cause us to merge with another BDC, private fund, separately managed account or another investment vehicle without shareholder approval, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act.
In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each share would be entitled to share ratably in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we paid or otherwise provide for all debts and other liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our preferred shares, if any preferred shares are outstanding at such time. For the purposes of this paragraph, a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity, or a sale or conveyance of all or any part of our property or assets will not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up, voluntary or involuntary.
Competition
We compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds (including private equity funds, mezzanine funds, performing and other credit funds, and funds that invest in CLOs, structured notes, derivatives and other types of collateralized securities and structured products), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of funding. These other BDCs and investment funds might be reasonable investment alternatives to us and may be less costly or complex with fewer and/or different risks than we have. Moreover, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, have begun to invest in areas in which they have not traditionally invested, including making investments in middle market private U.S. companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities in middle market 
24


private U.S. companies may intensify. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we have. These characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we are able to do. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors’ pricing, terms or structure. If we are forced to match our competitors’ pricing, terms or structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable returns on our investments or may bear substantial risk of capital loss. A significant part of our competitive advantage stems from the fact that the market for investments in middle market private U.S. companies is underserved by traditional commercial banks and other financial sources. A significant increase in the number and/or the size of our competitors in this target market could force us to accept less attractive investment terms. Furthermore, many of our competitors have greater experience operating under, or are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC.
For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Risks Related To Our Business And Structure.”
Human Resource Capital
We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of the Adviser or its affiliates pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administrator or its affiliates pursuant to the Administration Agreement. Each of our executive officers described herein is employed by the Adviser or its affiliates. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Adviser. The services necessary for the sourcing and administration of our investment portfolio will be provided by investment professionals employed by the Adviser or its affiliates. The Investment Team will focus on origination, non-originated investments and transaction development and the ongoing monitoring of our investments.
Share Repurchase Program
Beginning from the end of the Initial Drawdown Period, until an Exchange Listing, we intend to commence tender offers to allow shareholders to tender their shares on a quarterly basis at a price per share expected to reflect NAV per share. Any such share repurchase offer will be at the discretion of the Board to conduct, amend, suspend or terminate such share repurchase offer and subject to applicable law. We will conduct any repurchase offers in accordance with Section 23(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act. We intend that the NAV per share as of the last day of the applicable calendar quarter would be used for determining what amount tendering shareholders would receive in such repurchases. We intend to limit the number of shares repurchased pursuant to any such repurchase offers to 2.5% of outstanding shares, with the exact amount to be set by the Board. To the extent that the number of shares put to us for repurchase exceeds the number of shares that we are able to purchase, we will repurchase shares on a pro rata basis (based on the number of shares put to us for repurchase), not on a first-come, first-served basis. Unless shareholders tender their shares, shareholders must generally maintain a minimum balance of $5,000 subsequent to submitting a portion of their shares for repurchase by us, which such minimum balance the Adviser may waive in its sole discretion.
There is no assurance that the Board will adopt such a repurchase program and the Board may amend, suspend or terminate any such share repurchase program in its discretion. shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at all in the event our Board amends, suspends or terminates the share repurchase program, absent a liquidity event. We will notify shareholders of such developments in our quarterly reports or other filings. The share repurchase program has many limitations and should not be relied upon as a method to sell shares promptly or at a desired price.
Valuation Procedures
We conduct the valuation of our portfolio companies, pursuant to which our NAV shall be determined, at all times consistent with U.S. GAAP and the 1940 Act. Our Board, with the assistance of the Adviser, the Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s), will determine the fair value of our assets on at least a quarterly basis.
Investments for which market quotations are readily available will typically be valued at those market quotations.  To validate market quotations, we will utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Where it is possible to obtain reliable, independent market quotations from a third party vendor, we will use these quotations to determine the value of our investments. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly-traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is expected to be the case for a substantial portion of our investments, will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to procedures adopted by, and under the oversight 
25


of, the Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, the Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Board to review our investments.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Company uses a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:
•The valuation process begins with each investment being preliminarily valued by the Adviser’s valuation team in conjunction with the Adviser’s investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment;
•In addition, independent valuation firms engaged by the Board prepare valuations of all the Company’s investments over a de minimis threshold.  The independent valuation firms provide a final range of values on such investments to the Board and the Adviser.  The independent valuation firms also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations;
•The Adviser's Valuation Committee reviews each valuation recommendation to confirm they have been calculated in accordance with the valuation policy and compares such valuations to the independent valuation firms’ valuation ranges to ensure the Adviser’s valuations are reasonable;
•The Valuation Committee makes valuation recommendations to the Audit Committee;
•The Audit Committee reviews the valuation recommendations made by the Adviser's Valuation Committee, including the independent valuation firms' valuations, and once approved, recommends them for approval by the Board; and
•The Board reviews the valuation recommendations of the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Audit Committee, the Adviser's Valuation Committee and, where applicable, the independent valuation firms and other external service providers.
Valuation of each of our investments will generally be made as described above as of the end of each fiscal quarter. In cases where we determine our NAV at times other than a quarter end, we intend to update the value of securities with reliable market quotations to the most recent market quotation. For securities without reliable market quotations, non-quarterly valuations will generally be the most recent quarterly valuation unless a material event has occurred since the most recent quarter end with respect to the investment. Independent valuation firms are generally not used for non-quarterly valuations.
As part of the valuation process, we take into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of its investments, many of which are loans, including and in combination, as relevant, of: (i) the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company, (ii) the nature and realizable value of any collateral, (iii) the portfolio company’s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, (iv) the markets in which the portfolio company does business, (v) a comparison of the portfolio company’s securities to any similar publicly traded securities, and (vi) overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity or debt sale occurs, the Board or its delegates consider whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5. Fair Value Measurements.”
The Board has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of the Company’s portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Board may reasonably rely on that assistance. However, the Board is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Company’s valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.
Regulation as a Business Development Company
The following discussion is a general summary of the material prohibitions and descriptions governing BDCs generally. It does not purport to be a complete description of all of the laws and regulations affecting BDCs.
Qualifying Assets. Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as “Qualifying Assets,” unless, at the time the acquisition is made, Qualifying Assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of Qualifying Assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
26


(1)Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an Eligible Portfolio Company (as defined below), or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an Eligible Portfolio Company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An “Eligible Portfolio Company” is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
(a)is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
(b)is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
(c)satisfies any of the following:
(i)does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
(ii)has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
(iii)is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the Eligible Portfolio Company; or
(iv)is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million.
(2)Securities of any Eligible Portfolio Company controlled by the BDC.
(3)Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
(4)Securities of an Eligible Portfolio Company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and the BDC already owns 60% of the outstanding equity of the Eligible Portfolio Company.
(5)Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
(6)Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Significant Managerial Assistance. A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as Qualifying Assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its trustees, officers or employees, offers to provide and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through monitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising a portfolio company’s officers or other organizational or financial guidance.
Temporary Investments. Pending investment in other types of Qualifying Assets, as described above, our investments can consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which are referred to herein, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets would be Qualifying Assets.
Warrants. Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the issuance, terms and amount of warrants, options or rights to purchase shares that it may have outstanding at any time. In particular, the amount of shares that would result from 
27


the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase shares cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares.
Leverage and Senior Securities; Coverage Ratio. We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our shares if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would at least equal 150% immediately after each such issuance. On September 25, 2018, our sole shareholder approved the adoption of this 150% threshold pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and such election became effective the following day. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we are required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. We are also permitted to borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes, which borrowings would not be considered senior securities.
We have established asset based credit facilities and may establish future facilities or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. Our existing financing facilities bear, and it is anticipated that any future credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates at to be determined spreads over LIBOR. Shareholders indirectly bear the costs associated with any borrowings under a credit facility or otherwise, including increased management fees payable to the Adviser as a result of such borrowings. Our current credit facilities require us, and future lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. In addition, from time to time, our losses on leveraged investments may result in the liquidation of other investments held by us and may result in additional drawdowns to repay such amounts.
We also issued two unsecured bonds and may have additional bond offerings in the future. 
We may enter into a total return swap (“TRS”) agreement. A TRS is a contract in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to another party based on the change in the market value of the assets underlying the TRS, which may include a specified security, basket of securities or securities indices during a specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate. A TRS effectively adds leverage to a portfolio by providing investment exposure to a security or market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or investing directly in such market. Because of the unique structure of a TRS, a TRS often offers lower financing costs than are offered through more traditional borrowing arrangements. The Company would typically have to post collateral to cover this potential obligation. To the extent the Company segregates liquid assets with a value equal (on a daily mark-to-market basis) to its obligations under TRS transactions, enters into offsetting transactions or otherwise covers such TRS transactions in accordance with applicable SEC guidance, the leverage incurred through TRS will not be considered a borrowing for purposes of the Company’s overall leverage limitation.
We may also create leverage by securitizing our assets (including in CLOs) and retaining the equity portion of the securitized vehicle. Debt securitizations (including in CLOs) are a form of secured financing, which would generally be consolidated on our financial statements and subject to our overall asset coverage requirement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a CLO debt securitization on favorable terms or at all or that any such financing will benefit our investment performance. We may also from time to time make secured loans of our marginable securities to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions.
Code of Ethics. We and the Adviser have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code are permitted to invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. You may read and copy this code of ethics at the SEC's Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. You may also obtain copies of the codes of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC's Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
Affiliated Transactions. We may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from conducting certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our trustees who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us, among other things, to co-invest with certain other persons, including certain affiliates of the Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Adviser and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions.

Other. We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act, and be subject to the periodic reporting and related requirements of the 1934 Act.
We are also required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any trustee or officer against any liability to our shareholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
We are also required to designate a chief compliance officer and to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and to review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation.
We are not permitted to change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (i) 67% or more of such company’s shares present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to the Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of the Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by the Adviser, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, the Adviser has a duty to monitor corporate events and to vote proxies, as well as a duty to cast votes in the best interest of clients and not subrogate client interests to its own interests. Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act places specific requirements on registered investment advisers with proxy voting authority.
Proxy Policies
The Adviser’s policies and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that the Adviser votes proxies in the best interest of the Company and addresses how it will resolve any conflict of interest that may arise when voting proxies and, in so doing, to maximize the value of the investments made by the Company, taking into consideration the Company’s investment horizons and other relevant factors. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by its clients. Although the Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients’ portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
Decisions on how to vote a proxy generally are made by the Adviser. The Investment Committee and the members of the Investment Team covering the applicable security often have the most intimate knowledge of both a company’s operations and the potential impact of a proxy vote’s outcome. Decisions are based on a number of factors which may vary depending on a proxy’s subject matter, but are guided by the general policies described in the proxy policy. In addition, the Adviser may determine not to vote a proxy after consideration of the vote’s expected benefit to clients and the cost of voting the proxy. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, the Adviser will require the members of the Investment Committee to disclose any personal conflicts of interest they may have with respect to overseeing a Company’s investment in a particular company.
Proxy Voting Records
You may obtain information, without charge, regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, Blackstone Credit BDC Advisors LLC, 345 Park Avenue, 31st Floor, New York, NY 10154.
Reporting Obligations and Available Information
We furnish our shareholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the 1934 Act.

We file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, and our directors, officers and 10% beneficial owners file reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 pursuant to section 13(a), 15(d) or 16(a) of the 1934 Act. The SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information. We have made available free of charge on our website (www.bxsl.com) our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and our governing documents.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following discussion is a general summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to the Company. This discussion does not purport to be complete or to deal with all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to the Company. This discussion is based upon present provisions of the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative ruling authorities, all of which are subject to change, or differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect). Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors with regard to the U.S. federal tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of our shares, as well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, foreign country or other taxing jurisdiction.
The Company has elected to be treated, and intends to qualify each taxable year, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.
To qualify for the favorable tax treatment accorded to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code, the Company must, among other things: (1) have an election in effect to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; (2) have filed with its return for the taxable year an election to be a RIC or have made such election for a previous taxable year; (3) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from (a) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or currencies; and (b) net income derived from an interest in certain publicly traded partnerships that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that derive less than 90% of their gross income from the items described in (a) above (each, a “Qualified Publicly Traded Partnership”); and (4) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year of the Company (a) at least 50% of the value of the Company’s total assets is represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities and securities of other RICs, and other securities for purposes of this calculation limited, in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater in value than 5% of the value of the Company’s total assets and to not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Company’s total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of (I) any one issuer, (II) any two or more issuers which the Company controls and which are determined to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses or (III) any one or more Qualified Publicly Traded Partnerships (described in 3b above).
As a RIC, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that term is defined in the Code, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes in each taxable year to its shareholders, provided that it distributes at least 90% of the sum of its investment company taxable income and its net tax-exempt income for such taxable year. The Company intends to distribute to its shareholders, at least annually, substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain.
Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax. To prevent imposition of the excise tax, the Company must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 of the calendar year, and (iii) any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years. For these purposes, the Company will be deemed to have distributed any income or gains on which it paid U.S. federal income tax.
A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of any calendar year if it is declared by the Company in October, November or December with a record date in such a month and paid by the Company during January of the following calendar year. Such distributions will be taxable to shareholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.
If the Company fails to qualify as a RIC or fails to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Company would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on its taxable income (including distributions 
30


of net capital gain), even if such income were distributed to its shareholders, and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be taxed to shareholders as ordinary dividend income. Such distributions generally would be eligible (i) to be treated as “qualified dividend income” in the case of individual and other noncorporate shareholders and (ii) for the dividends received deduction in the case of corporate shareholders. In addition, the Company could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay taxes and make distributions (which could be subject to interest charges) before requalifying for taxation as a RIC.
