Item 1. Business
General
TCF Financial Corporation ("TCF") is a financial holding company, a Michigan corporation incorporated in 1973 and headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. TCF completed a merger of equals with Chemical Financial Corporation ("Merger of Equals") on August 1, 2019. We had total assets of $46.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and were the 28th largest publicly traded bank holding company in the United States based on total assets at December 31, 2019. 
Through our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, TCF National Bank, a national banking association ("TCF Bank") with its main office in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, we provide a full range of consumer-facing and commercial services, including consumer and commercial banking, trust and wealth management, and specialty leasing and lending products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial customers. As of December 31, 2019, we had 520 branches primarily located in Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Ohio, Colorado and Wisconsin (our "primary banking markets"). We also conduct business across all 50 states and Canada through our specialty lending and leasing businesses. 
References herein to "TCF Financial" refer to TCF Financial Corporation on an unconsolidated basis. TCF Financial Corporation (together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, are referred to as "we," "us," "our," "TCF" or the "Corporation".
Merger of Equals
On August 1, 2019 (the "Merger Date"), TCF Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Legacy TCF"), merged with and into Chemical Financial Corporation ("Chemical"), with Chemical surviving the merger (the "Merger"). Immediately following the Merger, Chemical’s wholly owned bank subsidiary, Chemical Bank, a Michigan state-chartered bank, merged with and into TCF Bank, with TCF Bank surviving the merger. Upon completion of the Merger, Chemical was renamed TCF Financial Corporation. 
The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting, therefore, Legacy TCF was deemed the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, even though Chemical was the legal acquirer. Accordingly, Legacy TCF's historical financial statements are the historical financial statements of the combined company for all periods before the Merger Date. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 include the results of operations of Chemical on and after August 1, 2019. Results for periods before August 1, 2019 reflect only those of Legacy TCF and do not include the results of operations of Chemical. Accordingly, comparisons of our results for the year ended December 31, 2019 with those of prior periods may not be meaningful. The number of shares issued and outstanding, earnings per share, additional paid-in-capital, dividends paid and all references to share quantities of TCF have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the equivalent number of shares issued in the Merger. See "Note 2. Merger" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In addition, the assets, including the intangible assets identified, and liabilities of Chemical as of the Merger Date have been recorded at their estimated fair value and added to those of Legacy TCF.
Reportable Segments
Our reportable segments are Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking and Enterprise Services. In connection with the Merger, we renamed the Wholesale Banking segment to Commercial Banking to align with the way it is now managed. 
Consumer Banking Segment
Consumer Banking is comprised of all of our consumer and small business-facing businesses and includes Retail Banking, Wealth Management, Residential and Consumer Lending, and Business Banking. Our consumer banking strategy is primarily to generate deposits and originate high credit quality loans for investment and sale. Deposits are generated from consumers and small businesses to provide a source of low-cost funds, with a focus on building and maintaining quality customer relationships.
1

Retail Banking We offer an array of solutions for consumers and small businesses through its physical and digital distribution channels. We offer a broad selection of deposit and lending services including (i) checking and savings accounts, (ii) credit and debit cards, (iii) check cashing and remittance services and (iv) residential, consumer and small business lending.
Deposits are our primary source of funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes. Deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates, market and competitive conditions and other economic factors. We acquire deposits from within our primary banking markets through (i) checking, savings and money market accounts, (ii) certificates of deposit and (iii) individual retirement accounts. Such deposit accounts provide fee income, including fees and service charges. 
At December 31, 2019, we had 520 branches, consisting of 396 traditional branches, 121 supermarket branches and three campus branches. We operate 236 branches in Michigan, 120 in Illinois, 85 in Minnesota, 32 in Colorado, 22 in Ohio, 17 in Wisconsin, seven in Arizona, and one in South Dakota. We also offer 1,099 ATMs across our primary banking markets. 
Providing a wide range of retail banking services is an integral component of our business philosophy. Primary drivers of our fees and service charges include the number of customers we attract, our customers' level of engagement and the frequency with which our customer uses our solutions. Our business philosophy is to offer our customers an "easy-to-bank-with" experience, with multiple solutions that benefit the customer and are consistent with our business philosophy. Our customers have convenient access to their funds through their credit and debit cards, as well as by utilizing our enhanced digital channels. Our card programs are supported by interchange fees paid by retailers. 
Wealth Management We offer services through the Wealth Management department of TCF Bank. These services include investment management and custodial services; trust services; financial and estate planning; and retirement planning and employee benefit programs. The Wealth Management department earns revenue largely from fees based on the market value of those assets under our management, which can fluctuate as the market fluctuates. Our Wealth Management department had assets under custodial and management arrangements of $5.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Through the Wealth Management department, we also sell investment products (largely annuity products and mutual funds) through the TCF Financial Advisors program. Customer assets within the TCF Financial Advisors program were $1.8 billion at December 31, 2019.
Residential and Consumer Lending  We originate residential and other consumer loans for personal, family or household purposes, such as home purchases, debt consolidation and financing of home improvements. Our retail lending origination activity primarily consists of consumer real estate secured lending. It also includes originating loans secured by personal property and, to a limited extent, unsecured personal loans. Consumer loans are originated for investment and for sale, either on a fixed-term basis or as a revolving line of credit. 
We also service loans for investors under contracts where we receive a fee for performing servicing activities on consumer loans that are not owned by us and are not included on our balance sheet. This process involves collecting monthly loan payments on behalf of investors, reporting information to those investors on a timely basis and maintaining custodial escrow accounts for remitting principal and interest payments to investors, and for paying property taxes and insurance premiums on behalf of borrowers.
On December 18, 2019, TCF Bank and its subsidiary Gateway One Lending & Finance, LLC completed the sale of the Legacy TCF auto finance portfolio, selling approximately $1.1 billion in motor vehicle consumer installment contracts to Santander Consumer USA Inc.
Business Banking We offer small businesses, corporations and governmental entities various products and services, including loans and lines of credit, deposits, cash management, capital market products, international trade finance, letters of credit, foreign exchange management services and loan syndication services.
Commercial Banking Segment
Commercial Banking, previously named Wholesale Banking, is comprised of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate banking and lease financing. Our commercial banking strategy focuses on building full commercial relationships including originating high credit quality loans and leases and providing deposit and treasury services. 
Commercial and Industrial The commercial and industrial loans we originate are secured by various types of business assets including inventory, receivables, equipment or financial instruments, and may also be backed by personal guarantees of the owner or other sources of repayment. Commercial and industrial loans are used for a variety of purposes, including working capital and financing the purchase of equipment.
TCF Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary, TCF Inventory Finance, Inc. ("TCFIF") originates commercial, primarily variable-rate loans which are secured by the underlying floorplan equipment and supported by repurchase agreements from original equipment manufacturers. TCFIF focuses on establishing relationships with distributors, dealer buying groups and manufacturers, giving us access to thousands of independent retailers primarily in the areas of powersports equipment and lawn and garden equipment. TCFIF's portfolio balances are impacted by seasonal shipments and sales activities as dealers receive inventory shipments in anticipation of the upcoming selling season while carrying current season product. In 2009, TCFIF formed a joint venture with The Toro Company ("Toro") called Red Iron Acceptance, LLC ("Red Iron"). Red Iron provides U.S. distributors and dealers and select Canadian distributors of the Toro® and Exmark® brands with reliable, cost-effective sources of financing. We maintain a 55% ownership interest in Red Iron, with Toro owning the other 45%.
Commercial Real Estate  The commercial real estate loans we originate are primarily secured by commercial real estate, including multi-family housing, office buildings, health care facilities, warehouse and industrial buildings, hotel and motel buildings, self-storage buildings and retail services buildings. The commercial real estate portfolio represented 39.3% and 24.3% of our total commercial portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Lease Financing Our leasing business, TCF Capital Solutions, a division of TCF Bank, delivers comprehensive lease and equipment finance products addressing the diverse financing needs of small to large companies in a growing number of select market segments including specialty vehicles, construction equipment, golf cart and turf equipment, manufacturing equipment, medical equipment, trucks and trailers, furniture and fixtures, technology and data processing equipment, and agricultural equipment. 
Enterprise Services
Enterprise Services is comprised of (i) corporate treasury, which includes our investment and borrowing portfolios and management of capital, debt and market risks, (ii) corporate functions, such as information technology, risk and credit management, bank operations, finance, investor relations, corporate development, internal audit, legal and human capital management that provide services to the operating segments, (iii) TCF Financial and (iv) eliminations. Our investment portfolio accounts for the earning assets within this segment. Borrowings may be used to offset reductions in deposits or to support lending activities. This segment also includes residual revenues and expenses representing the difference between actual amounts incurred by Enterprise Services and amounts allocated to the operating segments, including interest rate risk residuals such as funds transfer pricing mismatches.
Corporate Treasury  Corporate treasury's primary responsibility is management of our liquidity, capital, interest rate risk, and investment and borrowing portfolios. Corporate treasury has authority to invest in various types of liquid assets including, but not limited to, U.S. Department of the Treasury obligations and debt securities of various federal agencies and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises, obligations of states and political subdivisions, deposits of insured banks, bankers' acceptances and federal funds. Corporate treasury also has the authority to enter into wholesale borrowing transactions which may be used to compensate for reductions in deposit inflows or net deposit outflows, or to support lending, leasing and other expansion activities. These borrowings may include Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances, brokered deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds and other permitted borrowings from counterparties.
See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Income Statement Analysis - Reportable Segments" and "Note 27. Reportable Segments" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Other Information
Activities of Subsidiaries of TCF Our business operations include those conducted by direct and indirect subsidiaries of TCF Financial, all of which are consolidated for purposes of preparing our consolidated financial statements. TCF Bank's subsidiaries principally engage in inventory finance activities. See "Commercial Banking" above for further information.
Competition  We compete with a number of depository institutions and financial service providers primarily based on price and service and we face significant competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in lending activities. Direct competition for deposits comes primarily from banks, savings institutions, credit unions and investment banks. Additional significant competition for deposits comes from institutions selling money market mutual funds and corporate and government securities. We compete for the origination of loans with banks, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, consumer and commercial finance companies, credit unions, insurance companies and savings institutions. We also compete nationwide with other companies and banks in the financing of equipment and inventory, leasing of equipment and origination of residential mortgage loans. The growth of financial technology companies, disintermediation and lowered barriers to entry through technology have increased competition for loan, lease and deposit products as non-banks now offer products and services traditionally provided by banks.
Employees As of December 31, 2019, we had 8,209 employees, including 955 part-time employees. We provide our employees with comprehensive benefits, some of which are provided on a contributory basis, including medical and dental plans, a 401(k) savings plan with a company matching contribution, life insurance and short- and long-term disability coverage.
Supervision and Regulation
As a financial institution, we operate in a highly regulated environment. The regulatory framework under which we operate is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (the “FDIC’s”) Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of our shareholders and creditors. The following is a general summary of the material aspects of certain statutes and regulations applicable to us. These summary descriptions are not complete, and you should refer to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and corresponding guidance for more information. These statutes and regulations are subject to change, and additional statutes, regulations, and corresponding guidance may be adopted. We are unable to predict these future changes or the effects, if any, that these changes could have on our business, revenues, and results of operations.
Examinations and Regulatory Sanctions  TCF Financial is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”) and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Federal laws subject financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions, for violation of laws and policies. TCF Financial is required to file annual and quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries and charge the company for the cost of such an examination. TCF Bank is a national banking association, which is subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and secondarily by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The OCC regularly examines TCF Bank. The FDIC may also periodically examine and evaluate insured banks. TCF Bank is subject to requirements and restrictions under federal law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of TCF Bank.
Federal banking regulators may impose a number of restrictions or new requirements on institutions, including, but not limited to, growth limitations, dividend restrictions, increased regulatory capital requirements, increased loan and lease loss reserve requirements, increased supervisory assessments, activity limitations or other restrictions that could have an adverse effect on such institutions, their holding companies or holders of their debt and equity securities. Various enforcement remedies, including civil money penalties, may be assessed against an institution or an institution's directors, officers, employees, agents or independent contractors. Certain enforcement actions may not be publicly disclosed by us or our federal banking regulators. Subsidiaries of TCF Bank are also subject to state and/or self-regulatory organization licensing, regulation and examination requirements in connection with certain activities.
Regulatory Capital Requirements TCF Financial and TCF Bank are subject to various minimum regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. These requirements include quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items, as well as define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possible additional discretionary, actions by the federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
The Basel III capital standards impose minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with more than $3 billion in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements are imposed on “advanced approaches” banking organizations which are organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted into the Basel III capital regime. In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, under Basel III, a banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of common equity Tier 1 capital, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The 2.5% capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time, and became fully effective for us on January 1, 2019, resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. TCF Financial and TCF Bank made the one-time permanent election permitted under the Basel III capital standards to not include accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in regulatory capital. TCF Financial and TCF Bank exceeded the Basel III capital standard at December 31, 2019. See "Note 19. Regulatory Capital Requirements" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the upcoming implementation of a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL model, an accounting standard under GAAP; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. See "Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
In addition to the capital rules applicable to both banks and bank holding companies discussed above, under the prompt corrective action regulations, the federal bank regulators are required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized banks. For this purpose, a bank is placed in one of five categories based on the bank’s capital: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Currently, the quantitative requirements for being well-capitalized are (at least 5% leverage capital, 6.5% common equity Tier 1 capital, 8% Tier 1 capital and 10% total capital). TCF Bank was considered well-capitalized at December 31, 2019.
Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, banking regulators must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized.” The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category. An institution that is categorized as “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized” is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency, which, for TCF Bank, is the OCC. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject TCF Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits and other restrictions on our business.
Restrictions on Distributions  TCF Financial's ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve. In general, Federal Reserve regulatory guidelines require the board of directors of a bank holding company to consider a number of factors in determining the payment of dividends, including the quality and level of current and future earnings. Restricted retained earnings represents earnings legally appropriated to thrift bad debt reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes in prior years and is generally not available for payment of cash dividends or other distributions to shareholders. See "Note 18. Equity" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on restricted retained earnings.
Dividends or other capital distributions from TCF Bank to TCF Financial are the primary source of funds to enable TCF Financial to pay dividends on its preferred and common stock, to pay TCF Financial's obligations, to repurchase common stock or to meet other cash needs. The ability of TCF Financial and TCF Bank to pay dividends depends on regulatory policies and regulatory capital requirements and may be subject to regulatory approval. TCF Financial and TCF Bank must also obtain the common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions (as discussed above).

In general, TCF Bank may not declare or pay a dividend to TCF Financial in excess of 100% of its net retained earnings for the current year combined with its net retained earnings for the preceding two calendar years without prior approval of the OCC. The OCC also has the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a national bank when it determines such payments would constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice. TCF Bank's ability to make capital distributions in the future may require regulatory approval and may be restricted by the OCC. TCF Bank's ability to make any such distributions will also depend on its earnings and ability to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements in effect during future periods. In the future, these capital adequacy standards may be higher than existing minimum regulatory capital requirements. See "Note 19. Regulatory Capital Requirements" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
In addition, income tax considerations may limit the ability of TCF Bank to make dividend payments in excess of its current and accumulated tax earnings. Annual dividend distributions in excess of earnings could result in a tax liability based on the amount of excess earnings distributed and current tax rates.
Regulation of TCF and Affiliates and Insider Transactions  TCF Financial is subject to Federal Reserve regulations, examinations and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. Subsidiaries of bank holding companies, like TCF Bank, are subject to certain restrictions in their dealings with holding company affiliates.
Source of Strength A holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary banks and the Federal Reserve may require a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. In addition, the OCC may assess TCF Financial if it believes the capital of TCF Bank has become impaired. If TCF Financial were to fail to pay such an assessment within three months, the Board of Directors would be required to cause the sale of TCF Bank's stock to cover a deficiency in the capital. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and may be entitled to priority over other creditors.

Restrictions on Acquisitions and Changes in Control  Under federal and state law, merger and branch acquisition transactions may be subject to certain restrictions, including certain nationwide and statewide insured deposit maximum concentration levels or other limitations. In addition, federal and state laws and regulations contain a number of provisions which impose restrictions on changes in control of financial institutions such as TCF Bank and which require regulatory approval prior to any such changes in control.
Under the BHA Act, Federal Reserve approval is required before acquiring more than 5% control, or substantially all of the assets, of another bank or bank holding company, or merging or consolidating with such a bank or bank holding company. The BHCA also generally prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, providing services for its subsidiaries or conducting activities permitted by the Federal Reserve as being closely related to the business of banking. Further restrictions or limitations on acquisitions or establishing financial subsidiaries may also be imposed by our regulators or examiners.
Insurance of Accounts  TCF Bank is a member of the FDIC, which maintains the Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF"). The FDIC insures deposits up to prescribed limits for each depositor through the DIF, which is funded through assessments on member institutions. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") gave the FDIC much greater discretion to manage the DIF and also changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to average total assets less tangible equity. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act raised the minimum designated reserve ratio (the "DRR") to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits from 1.15% and required this new minimum be reached by September 30, 2020. From July 1, 2016 to October 1, 2018, an additional surcharge of 4.5 cents for each $100 of an institution's assessment base in excess of $10.0 billion was assessed to ensure the DRR reached this new minimum by the required date. The DIF ratio calculated by the FDIC using estimated insured deposits as of September 30, 2019 was 1.41%.
In 2019, insurance premiums on bank deposits insured by the FDIC for banks with at least $10.0 billion in total assets ranged from 1.5 cents to 40 cents per $100 of the institution's assessment base. Our FDIC insurance expense was $18.3 million, $15.1 million and $16.0 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In addition to deposit insurance premium assessments from the FDIC, additional assessments may be imposed by the Financing Corporation, a separate U.S. government agency affiliated with the FDIC, to pay for the interest cost of Financing Corporation bonds. The final collection for this assessment was on March 29, 2019.
Community Reinvestment Act TCF Bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), which requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low- and moderate- income neighborhoods. The CRA further requires these criteria to be considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in the imposition of additional requirements and limitations on TCF Bank. Additionally, financial institutions must publicly disclose the terms of various CRA‑related agreements. In its most recent CRA examination, TCF Bank received an “outstanding” rating. 
In December 2019, the FDIC and the OCC proposed changes to the regulations implementing the CRA, which, if adopted will result in changes to the current CRA framework. The Federal Reserve Board did not join the proposal. 
CFPB Examination The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, such as TCF Bank. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. 
The CFPB has issued a number of regulations related to the origination of mortgages, foreclosures, and overdrafts as well as many other consumer issues. Additionally, the CFPB has proposed, or may propose, additional regulations or modifying existing regulations that directly relate to our business. Although it is difficult to predict at this time the extent to which the CFPB’s final rules impact the operations and financial condition of the TCF Bank, such rules may have a material impact on our compliance costs, compliance risk and fee income.
Anti-Money Laundering As a financial institution, TCF Bank must maintain anti‑money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and “knowing your customer” in their dealings with foreign financial institutions, foreign customers and other high-risk customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks. Anti‑money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the USA PATRIOT Act (the “Patriot Act”), as described below. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations, and this area has become a particular focus of the regulators in recent years. In addition, the regulators are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. The regulatory authorities have been active in imposing “cease and desist” orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
USA Patriot Act The Patriot Act became effective on October 26, 2001 and amended the Bank Secrecy Act. The Patriot Act provides, in part, for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering by enhancing anti‑money laundering and financial transparency laws, as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including:

• | requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening;


• | rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering;


• | reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and


• | filing suspicious activities reports by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations.

The Patriot Act requires financial institutions to undertake enhanced due diligence of private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non‑U.S. persons that they administer, maintain, or manage. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications.
Under the Patriot Act, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) can send TCF Bank a list of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities or money laundering. TCF Bank may be requested to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on the list. If TCF Bank finds any relationships or transactions, it must report those relationships or transactions to FinCEN.
Consumer Protection Regulations Interest and other charges that TCF Bank collects or contracts for are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. TCF Bank’s loan operations also are subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:

• | the Truth in Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and


• | the rules and regulations of the various governmental agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.

In addition, TCF Bank’s deposit operations are subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of ATMs and other electronic banking services.
National Bank Investment Limitations  Permissible investments by national banks are limited by the National Bank Act of 1864, as amended, and by rules of the OCC. Non-traditional bank activities permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 will subject a bank to additional regulatory limitations or requirements, including a required regulatory capital deduction and application of transactions with affiliates limitations in connection with such activities.
Taxation 
Federal Taxation  Our federal income tax returns are open and subject to examination for 2016 and later tax return years. 
State Taxation  TCF and/or its subsidiaries currently file tax returns in all state and local taxing jurisdictions which impose corporate income, franchise or other taxes. Our various state income tax returns are generally open for 2015 and later tax return years based on individual state statutes of limitation. The methods of filing and the methods for calculating taxable and apportionable income vary depending on the laws of each taxing jurisdiction. 
Foreign Taxation TCF and/or its subsidiaries currently file tax returns in Canada and certain Canadian provinces which impose corporate income taxes. Our various foreign income tax returns are open and subject to examination for 2015 and later tax return years. The methods of filing and the methods for calculating taxable and apportionable income vary depending on the laws of each taxing jurisdiction. 
See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Consolidated Income Statement Analysis - Income Taxes", "Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note 16. Income Taxes" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding TCF's income taxes.
