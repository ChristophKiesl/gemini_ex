The Company assists many of its clients with certain transaction-related EDGAR filing and print services (including registration statements, prospectuses, offering circulars, proxy statements and XBRL-tagged filings), as well as with the technical aspects of the regulatory filing process. The Company has conferencing facilities in most major cities in the U.S. and the international jurisdictions in which it has operations for in-person working groups to meet to strategize and prepare documents for the transactional deal stream. The Company’s sites are outfitted to provide EDGAR filing capabilities, typesetting, meeting rooms and around-the-clock service.

Using its filing capabilities, the Company works with many of its GIM clients to prepare and submit these 1940 Act and XBRL filings using the SEC’s specified file formats. 
 Changes in how investors consume information have led to new ways for investors to receive disclosure documents. GIM offers various technology and electronic delivery products and services to make the distribution of documents and content more efficient.

Spin-off Transaction
 On October 1, 2016, Donnelley Financial became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by RRD of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of Donnelley Financial common stock to RRD shareholders (the “Separation”). Holders of RRD common stock received one share of Donnelley Financial common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. RRD retained approximately 6.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial common stock, or a 19.25% interest in Donnelley Financial, as part of the Separation, but expects to dispose of the common stock that it retained in the 12-month period following the Separation. Donnelley Financial’s Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective by the SEC on September 20, 2016. Donnelley Financial’s common stock began regular-way trading under the ticker symbol “DFIN” on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016. On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the previously announced separation of LSC Communications, Inc. (“LSC”), its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business.
Competition 
 Technological and regulatory changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data hosting of media content, continue to impact the market for our products and services. One of the Company’s competitive strengths is that it offers a wide array of communications products, compliance services and technologies, a global platform, exceptional sales and service and regulatory domain expertise, which provide differentiated solutions for its clients. 
 The financial communications services industry, in general, is highly competitive and barriers to entry have decreased as a result of technology innovation.   Despite some consolidation in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented in the United States and even more so internationally with many in-country alternative providers. The Company expects competition to increase from existing competitors, as well as new and emerging market entrants. In addition, as the Company expands its product and service offerings, it may face competition from new and existing competitors. The Company competes primarily on product quality and functionality, service levels, subject matter regulatory expertise, security and compliance characteristics, price and reputation. 
 The impact of digital technologies has been felt in many print products, most acutely in the Company’s mutual fund, variable annuity and public company compliance business offerings.  Historically, the Company has been a high-touch, service oriented business. Technology changes have provided alternatives to the Company’s clients that allow them to manage more of the financial disclosure process themselves through collaborative document management solutions.  For years, the Company has invested in its own applications, ActiveDisclosure, FundSuiteArc and Venue to serve clients and increase retention and has invested to expand capabilities and address new market sectors. The future impact of technology on the business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, the Company has made targeted acquisitions and investments in its existing business to offer clients innovative services and solutions, including acquisitions of EDGAR Online and MultiCorpora and investments in Mediant, Peloton and eBrevia that further solidify the Company’s position as a technology service leader in the industry.  
 The Company’s competitors for SEC filing services for capital markets clients include full service financial communications providers, technology point solution providers focused on financial communications and general technology providers. The Company’s competitors for SEC filing services for investment markets clients include full service traditional providers, small niche technology providers and local and regional print providers that bid against the Company for printing, mailing and fulfillment services.  Language solutions competes with global and local language service providers and language/globalization software vendors.

Market Volatility/Cyclicality 
 The Company is subject to market volatility in the United States and world economy, as the success of the transactional offering is largely dependent on the global market for IPOs, secondary offerings, mergers and acquisitions, public and private debt offerings, leveraged buyouts, spinouts and other transactions. The International segment is particularly susceptible to capital market volatility as most of the International business is capital markets transaction focused. The Company mitigates some of that risk by offering services in higher demand during a down market, like document management tools for the bankruptcy/restructuring process, and also moving upstream from the filing process with products like Venue, the Company’s data room solution. The Company also attempts to balance this volatility through supporting the quarterly/annual public company reporting process through its EDGAR filing services and ActiveDisclosure product, its investment markets regulatory and shareholder communications offering and continues to expand into adjacent growth businesses like language solutions and data and analytics, which have recurring revenues and are not as susceptible to market volatility and cycles. This quarterly/annual public company reporting process work also subjects the Company to filing seasonality shortly after the end of each fiscal quarter, with peak periods during the course of the year that have operational implications. Such operational implications include the need to increase staff during peak periods through a combined strategy of hiring additional full-time and temporary personnel, increasing the premium time of existing staff, and outsourcing production for a number of services. Additionally, clients and their financial advisors have begun to increasingly rely on web-based services which allow clients to autonomously file and distribute compliance documents with regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. While the Company believes that its ActiveDisclosure and FundSuiteArc solutions are competitive in this space, competitors are continuing to develop technologies that aim to improve clients’ ability to autonomously produce and file documents to meet their regulatory obligations. The Company continues to remain focused on driving recurring revenue in order to mitigate market volatility.
 Raw Materials 
 The primary raw materials used in the Company’s printed products are paper and ink. The paper and ink supply is sourced from a small set of select suppliers in order to ensure consistent quality that meets the Company’s performance expectations and provides for continuity of supply. The Company believes that the risk of incurring material losses as a result of a shortage in raw materials is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would not have a materially negative impact on the Company’s business. 
Distribution
 The Company’s products are distributed to end-users through the U.S or foreign postal services, through retail channels, electronically or by direct shipment to customer facilities. Postal costs are a significant component of many customers’ cost structures and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces that the Company’s customers are willing to print and mail.
Customers 
 For each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated and combined net sales. 
 Technology
 The Company invests resources in developing software to improve its services. The Company invests in its core composition systems and client facing solutions and has also adopted market-leading third party systems which have improved the efficiency of its sales and operations processes.
Environmental Compliance 
 It is the Company’s policy to conduct its global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future. However, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated and combined annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 3,600 employees.
