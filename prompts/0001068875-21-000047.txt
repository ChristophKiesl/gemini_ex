ITEM 1. Business
General Overview
Blucora, Inc. (the “Company,” “Blucora,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a leading provider of integrated tax-focused wealth management services and software, assisting consumers, small business owners, tax professionals, financial professionals, and certified public accounting (“CPA”) firms in achieving better long-term outcomes via holistic, tax-advantaged solutions. Our mission is to empower people to improve their financial wellness through data and technology-driven solutions. We conduct our operations through two primary businesses: (1) the Wealth Management business and (2) the Tax Preparation business. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “BCOR.”
The Wealth Management business consists of the operations of Avantax Wealth Management and Avantax Planning Partners (collectively, the “Wealth Management business” or the “Wealth Management segment”). 
Avantax Wealth Management provides tax-focused wealth management solutions for financial professionals, tax professionals, CPA firms, and their clients. Avantax Wealth Management works with a nationwide network of financial professionals that operate as independent contractors and provides these financial professionals with an integrated platform of technical, practice, compliance, and product support tools to assist in making each financial professional a comprehensive financial service center for his or her clients. 
Avantax Planning Partners, which we acquired on July 1, 2020, operates as a captive, or employee-based, registered investment advisor (“RIA”) and wealth management business that partners with CPA firms in order to provide their consumer and small business clients with holistic financial planning and advisory services, as well as retirement plan solutions. Avantax Planning Partners formerly operated as Honkamp Krueger Financial Services, Inc. (“HKFS”). 
As of December 31, 2020, the Wealth Management business worked with a nationwide network of 3,770 financial professionals and supported $83.0 billion of total client assets, including $35.6 billion of advisory assets. 
The Tax Preparation business consists of the operations of TaxAct, Inc. (“TaxAct,” the “Tax Preparation business,” or the “Tax Preparation segment”) and provides digital tax preparation solutions for consumers, small business owners, and tax professionals through its website www.TaxAct.com, and its mobile applications. For the year ended December 31, 2020, TaxAct powered approximately 3.2 million consumer e-files directly through end-users and another 2.1 million professional e-files through approximately 20,000 tax professionals who used TaxAct to prepare and file their taxes or those of their clients.
Business Overview
We have two reportable segments: (1) the Wealth Management segment and (2) the Tax Preparation segment. 
Wealth Management Business
As described above, the Wealth Management business consists of the operations of Avantax Wealth Management and Avantax Planning Partners, which we believe provide unique and complementary models through which tax and financial professionals can affiliate with us. These models include:
•an independent broker-dealer for tax and wealth management professionals for whom independence is paramount;
•multiple referral models for tax professionals who prefer a partnership or affiliation model through which their clients’ financial planning needs are met; and
•an employee-based RIA model serving CPAs and tax professionals who desire to provide tax-advantaged financial solutions for their clients.
Flexible affiliation models are core to the Wealth Management business’s value proposition because they offer powerful ways for us to partner with CPAs and tax professionals of all sizes, from sole practitioners to multi-partner CPA firms.

Avantax Wealth Management. Through its registered broker-dealer, RIA, and insurance agency subsidiaries, Avantax Wealth Management provides tax-focused wealth management solutions to financial professionals and their clients nationwide and operates the largest U.S. tax-focused independent broker-dealer.
Avantax Wealth Management works with a nationwide network of financial professionals that operate as independent contractors. Because Avantax Wealth Management primarily recruits and serves independent tax professionals, CPA firms, and financial professionals who partner with established tax practices, most Avantax Wealth Management financial professionals have long-standing tax advisory relationships that anchor their wealth management businesses. This contrasts with traditional independent broker-dealers and investment advisers who are typically limited to providing investment advice to their clients.
We believe that tax and accounting professionals, with their existing client relationships and in-depth knowledge of their clients’ financial situations, are well positioned to grow their wealth management practices as their tax advisory relationships provide a large base of potential clients. This competitive advantage results in an experienced and stable network of financial professionals who are uniquely positioned to provide tailored and comprehensive financial solutions that enable clients to meet their financial goals, including their tax goals. In turn, our financial professionals have multiple revenue-generating options to diversify their earnings sources.
To help tax and accounting professionals integrate wealth management services into their practice, we offer specialized training and support that introduces these financial professionals to the investment business and helps them build their practices. The comprehensive training curriculum is administered through a multi-medium approach, including an annual national sales conference, numerous advisor- and home-office led training events, regional meetings, and on-demand learning resources.
Once financial professionals have integrated wealth management into their practices, Avantax Wealth Management provides an open-architecture investment platform and technology tools to help financial professionals identify investment opportunities for their clients. In addition, Avantax Wealth Management supports its financial professionals through its proprietary software tools that are designed to help financial professionals systematically capture tax-alpha (i.e., the incremental performance an investor can achieve, relative to market returns, by taking advantage of available tax-saving strategies) for clients by identifying tax savings opportunities in a financial professional’s client base and automating the capture of that opportunity. Our ongoing investments in technology and data analytics are designed to drive enhanced experiences for financial professionals and their end clients, and in turn, grow client assets over time.
Avantax Wealth Management also has a highly experienced home office team that is focused on developing and delivering solutions tailored to each financial professional’s practice. The home office team provides marketing, practice management, product support, wealth management, retirement services, compliance, business consulting, succession planning, and other support to our financial professionals.
Avantax Planning Partners. As a tax-focused captive RIA, Avantax Planning Partners’ financial professionals are employees of Avantax Planning Partners who partner with CPA firms across the country to provide tax-advantaged planning and financial solutions for their clients. Avantax Planning Partners recruits and builds relationships with CPA firms who desire to provide their clients with tax-advantaged wealth management solutions and financial plans, but prefer to outsource that service to a trusted expert.
By the nature of the business, CPAs develop deep, long-lasting relationships with their clients and have insight into their tax and wealth management needs. The trust built in these long-standing relationships provides a solid foundation to recommend a client to a trusted Avantax Planning Partners in-house financial professional.
Holistic financial planning is the core offering of Avantax Planning Partners. In-house financial professionals provide guidance in asset management, retirement planning, advanced planning (including, among other things, business succession planning and estate planning), strategic tax and income planning, and insurance. 
To assist affiliate CPA firms with integrating wealth management services into their practice, Avantax Planning Partners offers specialized training and support that introduces CPAs to the investment business and identifies the CPA firms’ top potential clients. CPAs then work directly with in-house financial professionals to refer clients and provide wealth management solutions.

Avantax Wealth Management and Avantax Planning Partners primarily generate revenue through securities and insurance commissions, quarterly investment advisory fees based on advisory assets, product marketing service agreements, retirement plan servicing fees, and other agreements and fees. We regularly review the commissions and fees charged for these products and services based on the evolving regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate and as a result of changes in client preferences and needs. For additional information on the Wealth Management segment’s revenues, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2.” 
Tax Preparation Business
TaxAct, a leading provider of digital tax preparation solutions, has leveraged its strong brand, comprehensive suite of tax preparation solutions, and proven digital lead generation capabilities to enable the filing of more than 80 million federal tax returns since 2000. TaxAct operates as a value player in its market, with a mission to empower people to navigate the complexities of tax preparation with ease and accuracy at a fair price.
In addition to TaxAct’s core offerings, TaxAct offers ancillary services such as refund payment transfer, audit defense, and stored value cards, as well as presenting customers the option to review and take advantage of personalized tax and potential financial savings opportunities offered through third party product providers. We believe that TaxAct’s ease of use, affordable pricing, and established brand and reputation are attractive to customers.
TaxAct had four primary offerings for consumers in 2020: 
•A “free” federal and state edition that handled simple returns;
•A “deluxe” paid offering that contained all of the free offering features in addition to tools to maximize credits and deductions, as well as tools for homeowners;
•A “premier” paid offering that contained all of the deluxe offering features in addition to tools for investments, rental property, and prioritized support; and
•A “self-employed” paid offering for independent contractors and self-employed filers.
TaxAct also had offerings for small business owners consisting of separate offerings for sole proprietors, partnerships, C corporations, and S corporations.
TaxAct’s professional tax preparer software focuses on the unique needs of small tax offices and solo tax preparers and provides the tools for these professional tax preparers to prepare and file individual and business returns for their clients. TaxAct offers flexible pricing and packaging options that help tax professionals save money by paying only for the specific services that they need. In addition, the professional tax preparer software includes valuable features that tax professionals count on to maximize their efficiency and productivity, including the option of entering data directly into tax forms, utilizing a question-and-answer interview method to enter data, or easily toggling between the two data entry methods. TaxAct generates revenue primarily through its digital service offerings at www.TaxAct.com and its mobile applications.
Our History
We were formed in 1996 as a Delaware corporation. Significant recent events in our history include:
•In January 2012, we acquired TaxAct, a provider of digital tax preparation solutions.
•In December 2015, we acquired HDV Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“HD Vest”), a provider of wealth management and advisory solutions specifically for tax professionals, and announced our plans to focus on the technology-enabled financial solutions market.
•On May 6, 2019, we closed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of 1st Global, Inc. and 1st Global Insurance Services, Inc. (together, “1st Global”), a tax-focused wealth management company (the “1st Global Acquisition”). The 1st Global Acquisition was strategically important as it expanded our presence as the leading tax-focused independent broker-dealer while also providing the scale to compete more broadly in the wealth management market. 
Blucora, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K 


Table of Contents

•On September 9, 2019, we announced a rebranding of our Wealth Management business to Avantax Wealth Management (the “2019 Rebranding”). In connection with the 2019 Rebranding, HD Vest (which comprised all of the Wealth Management business prior to the 1st Global Acquisition) was renamed Avantax Wealth Management in mid-September 2019, and 1st Global converted in late October 2019. 
•On July 1, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of HKFS (the “HKFS Acquisition”). HKFS operates as a captive, or employee-based, RIA and wealth management business that partners with CPA firms in order to provide their consumer and small business clients with holistic financial planning and advisory services. The HKFS Acquisition enabled us to expand the ways we can work with CPA firms and tax professionals to deliver wealth management services to clients, increase our addressable market, and enhance our growth opportunities.
•On January 4, 2021, we announced the rebranding of HKFS to Avantax Planning Partners (the “2021 Rebranding”). The 2021 Rebranding was designed to create tighter brand alignment, bringing our Wealth Management business under one common and recognizable brand.
Industry Trends
In the wealth management industry, we believe that we are benefiting and will continue to benefit from several positive industry trends, including growth of investable assets, a continued migration to independent financial professional channels, and a continued shift toward household use of fee-based financial professionals. In addition, the captive or employee-based RIA market segment, in which Avantax Planning Partners belongs, is the fastest-growing market segment within the wealth management industry.
In the tax preparation industry, TaxAct participates in the consumer digital do-it-yourself (“DDIY”) tax preparation solutions market, which is the fastest growing market segment in the tax preparation industry and is bolstered by a growing population that continues to adopt technology-enabled financial solutions that drive value and ease in their everyday lives. 
Growth Strategy
Our growth strategy begins with our mission to empower people to improve their financial wellness with data and technology-driven, tax-focused financial solutions. Taxes are one of life’s largest expenses, yet the tax preparation industry primarily focuses consumers on maximizing a once-a-year refund. Historically, the wealth management industry has largely ignored the impacts of taxes or only executed tax-advantaged strategies for the wealthiest segment of wealth management clients. Through our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses, we seek to execute holistic, long-term tax minimization strategies for our clients and customers while expanding access to those strategies to a broader group of taxpayers. We believe this approach will drive better outcomes for our clients leading to higher customer acquisition, greater lifetime values, and overall better retention. Our growth strategies include:
•In the Wealth Management business, accelerating organic growth in the tax-focused wealth management space by:
•enhancing our financial professional experience with continued investment in service quality and team training to deliver a superior capability;
•completing remaining elements of integration from acquisitions to drive efficiencies across the business;
•when in the client’s best interest, improving client asset retention and monetization through the continued shift of client assets into advisory accounts through appropriate coaching, tools, training, and programs;
•continuing to invest in our technology and product offerings to create positive experiences for our financial professionals and their clients;
•leveraging the software development capabilities of TaxAct to improve the service and performance of products offered to our financial professionals; and
•expanding our product and service offerings for our financial professionals utilizing best practices. This includes expanding our turn-key retirement planning solutions business to a nationwide footprint through Avantax Planning Partners. 
Blucora, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K 


Table of Contents

•In the Tax Preparation business, creating continued growth and momentum by:
•implementing new marketing programs to drive customer acquisition;
•expanding our tax preparation offerings with hybrid or “live-assisted” capabilities to provide more options for customers in how to complete their returns;
•refining pricing strategy to enable us to win in the market and drive robust growth;
•expanding our value-generating partner ecosystem to increase our distribution capabilities and provide compelling offers for more potential customers;
•continuing to invest in our core product experience based on direct customer feedback and research to create best-in-class user experiences for our existing customers and target markets;
•differentiating the TaxAct experience from experiences on other platforms by offering unique product capabilities and features that reinforce our brand’s deep expertise in tax for both consumers and tax professionals;
•driving heightened awareness of our TaxAct professional software to meet the needs of solo practitioners and small tax offices;
•innovating and testing new solutions and models that expand the DDIY category; and
•providing ancillary services and partnerships to our customers that enhance our value and brand promise.
•Across Blucora, driving incremental growth and realizing the value of our holistic strategy by realizing synergies between Tax Preparation and Wealth Management, initially including: 
•converting TaxAct Professionals into Avantax Wealth Management financial professionals or affiliate partners;
•leveraging sophisticated online marketing capabilities from the Tax Preparation segment to offer to financial professionals in the Wealth Management segment; and
•improving the tools needed to make our financial professionals more productive by leveraging the product and technology leadership from TaxAct.
A key element of our growth strategy is to create a culture of learning and innovation to test specific opportunities across our business and scale those opportunities that show value. For example, we have more than 23,000 tax professionals using our TaxAct Professional software. This base of professionals represents a significant population of potential future financial professionals or referral sources for our Wealth Management business. Additionally, TaxAct possesses significant lead generation and marketing capabilities that we seek to leverage in order to better support wealth management financial professionals with their marketing needs. We intend to conduct focused testing on these concepts to evaluate their value potential and intend to scale the concepts that show the highest promise. 
Underlying this learning and innovation approach is a consolidated information technology and data architecture, coupled with a focused effort on the human capital necessary to support our business. As part of this overall strategy, we are investing in our infrastructure to drive higher efficiencies, speed execution, and unlock new opportunities.
We believe that if we successfully execute on the above growth strategies, we will improve performance and deliver on the key financial metrics that drive our organization. These key metrics currently include revenue growth, net income growth, adjusted EBITDA growth, and non-GAAP net income growth. Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, including definitions of such measures, see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Seasonality
Our Tax Preparation segment is highly seasonal, with a significant portion of its annual revenue typically earned in the first four months of our fiscal year. During the third and fourth quarters, the Tax Preparation segment typically reports losses because revenue from the segment during this period is minimal while core operating

expenses continue. In March 2020 and as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) extended the filing and payment deadline for federal tax returns from April 15, 2020 to July 15, 2020. This extension resulted in the shifting of a significant portion of Tax Preparation segment revenue that would typically be expected to be earned in the first and second quarters of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020. In addition, sales and marketing expenses were elevated in 2020 due to incremental investment in March 2020 to address weak performance through the first two months of the tax season, as well as increased marketing required due to the extended tax season. The IRS delayed the start of the 2021 tax season and did not begin accepting and processing 2020 tax year returns until February 12, 2021. It is currently unknown if the IRS will need to extend the tax filing deadline in 2021; however, the IRS has revoked its earlier commitments to end the 2021 tax season on time. An extension of the tax filing deadline in 2021 could result in customer and revenue disruptions and increased expenses in 2021.
Competition
The markets in which our businesses operate continue to evolve and are highly competitive. For our businesses to be successful, we must effectively compete in the wealth management and tax preparation markets, as described in more detail below.
Wealth Management Competition
The wealth management industry is a highly competitive and fragmented global industry. We and the financial professionals with whom we partner compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, including traditional wirehouses, independent broker-dealers, registered investment advisers (including CPA firms that have their own in-house registered investment advisor), asset managers, banks and insurance companies, direct distributors, and larger broker-dealers. These competitors may have greater financial, technological, and marketing resources, broader infrastructure and distribution networks, greater brand recognition, and broader product and service offerings than us. We compete directly with these financial institutions for the provision of products and services to clients, as well as for recruitment and retention of financial professionals. 
We believe that our competitive position in the wealth management industry is a function of providing effective, differentiated service and tools to tax professionals, while understanding the needs of these tax professionals with respect to wealth management, in order to maximize the opportunity to provide tax-advantaged financial planning and advice to end clients. We believe that our competitive advantage is centered on the following differentiators:
•We seek to marry tax planning and preparation with financial planning and advisory service for all taxpayers, not just the ultra-high net worth.
•We have the largest network of tax-focused financial professionals who partner with us through multiple affiliation models, which include:
◦an independent broker-dealer for tax and wealth management professionals for whom independence is paramount;
◦multiple referral models for tax professionals who prefer a partnership or affiliation model through which their clients’ financial planning needs are met; and
◦an employee-based model serving CPAs and tax professionals who desire to provide tax-advantaged financial solutions for their clients through our in-house RIA;
•We offer tools, training, and support that are uniquely tailored to the needs of tax-focused financial professionals.
•Our understanding of the wealth management and tax businesses enables us to deliver optimal service with both businesses in mind.
Tax Preparation Competition
The market for tax preparation products and services continues to evolve and is highly competitive. We experience significant competition and expect this competitive environment to continue. We encounter direct competition from numerous other tax preparation software products and digital services. These competitors include Intuit’s TurboTax and H&R Block’s DDIY consumer products and services, which currently serve a significant percentage of the software and digital service market. These competitors may have greater financial, technological, and marketing resources, broader infrastructure and distribution networks, greater brand recognition, and broader 
Blucora, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K 


Table of Contents

product and service offerings than us. We also encounter competition from alternate methods of tax preparation such as storefront tax preparation services, which includes both local tax preparers and large chains such as H&R Block, Liberty Tax, and Jackson Hewitt. We may also compete against new market entrants who could take a portion of our market share. Finally, our TaxAct business faces the risk that state or federal taxing agencies will offer software or systems to provide direct access for individual filers that will reduce the need for TaxAct’s software and services. 
We believe that our competitive position in the market for tax preparation software and services is a function of our ability to differentiate our brand versus those of our competitors by:
•optimizing or minimizing the taxes paid by each of our customers;
•continuing to offer reliable, easy-to-use, and accessible software and services that are compelling to consumers;
•providing unique features not offered by the competition, including:
▪ProTips — Contextually relevant insights on often overlooked or unknown tax guidelines that enable customers to save money on their taxes;
▪Deduction Maximizer — A tool that checks each customer’s return for certain potentially overlooked tax savings or credits, in addition to data issues or potentially missing data;
▪My TaxPlan — A personalized action plan for each TaxAct customer that provides several concrete things they can do in the coming year to improve their tax outcome for the following year;
▪Efile Concierge — A unique add-on offering that proactively notifies customers with a phone call when their e-filed return has been accepted by the IRS. In the case of a rejection by the IRS, the customer receives a phone call guiding them through the process of updating and resubmitting the return;
▪$100k Accuracy Guarantee — The only provider willing to not only guarantee the customer’s return is 100% accurate, but also back that promise up to pay for any errors up to $100k;
•offering competitive pricing;
•offering software that is backed by financial and tax-expertise;
•ensuring the privacy and security of user data submitted through our products;
•marketing our software and services in a cost-effective way;
•offering ancillary services that are attractive to users; 
•appealing to our customers as a “challenger” brand; and
•continually innovating new tax preparation services that meet the needs of our customers.
Governmental Regulation
Blucora is a publicly traded company that is subject to SEC and NASDAQ Global Select Market rules and regulations regarding public disclosure, financial reporting, internal controls, and corporate governance. Our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation segments are subject to federal and state government requirements, including regulations related to consumer protection, user privacy, security, pricing, taxation, intellectual property, labor, advertising, broker-dealers, securities, investment advisers, asset management, insurance, listing standards, and product and services quality.
Our Wealth Management segment is subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and is heavily regulated by multiple agencies, including the SEC, FINRA, state securities and insurance regulators, and other regulatory authorities. Our Wealth Management subsidiary, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC, a member of FINRA, and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. Broker-dealers and their representatives are subject to laws, rules and 
Blucora, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K 


Table of Contents

regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, the conduct of directors, officers, and employees, and general anti-fraud provisions. Broker-dealers and their representatives are also regulated by state securities administrators in those jurisdictions where they do business. Compliance with many of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us involves a number of risks, because laws, rules and regulations frequently change and are subject to varying interpretations, among other reasons. Regulators make periodic examinations of our broker-dealer operations and review annual, monthly, and other reports on our operations and financial condition. Violations of laws, rules and regulations governing a broker-dealer’s actions could result in censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the restriction, suspension, or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer, its representatives or its officers or employees, or other similar adverse consequences.
Our Wealth Management subsidiaries, Avantax Advisory Services and Avantax Planning Partners, are registered with the SEC as RIAs and are subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, advisory fees, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between the advisor and advisory clients, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, and general anti-fraud provisions. The SEC periodically examines our investment advisor operations and reviews annual, monthly, and other reports on our operations and financial condition. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and other federal securities laws, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment advisor’s registration. Investment advisor representatives also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the Advisers Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, profit disgorgement, fines, or other similar adverse consequences.
Our Wealth Management subsidiaries, Avantax Insurance Agency LLC, Avantax Insurance Services, Inc., and Avantax Planning Partners, Inc., are insurance agencies licensed with the state licensing authority in the jurisdictions where they do business. Insurance agencies and their agents are subject to laws, rules and regulations covering all aspects of the insurance business, including sales practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds, recordkeeping and reporting, the conduct of directors, officers, and employees, and general anti-fraud provisions. Insurance agencies and their agents are regulated by state insurance administrators in those jurisdictions where they do business. Compliance with many of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us involves a number of risks, because laws, rules, and regulations frequently change and are subject to varying interpretations, among other reasons. Violations of laws, rules, and regulations governing an insurance agency’s actions could result in censure, penalties, and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the restriction, suspension, or expulsion of the agency or its agent or its officers or employees, from the insurance industry of a jurisdiction where they do business, or other similar adverse consequences.
Our Wealth Management subsidiaries offer certain products and services subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and to regulations promulgated under ERISA or the Code, insofar as they provide services with respect to plan clients, or otherwise deal with plan clients that are subject to ERISA or the Code. ERISA imposes certain duties on persons who are “fiduciaries” (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) and prohibits certain transactions involving plans subject to ERISA and fiduciaries or other service providers to such plans. Non-compliance with these provisions may expose an ERISA fiduciary or other service provider to liability under ERISA, which may include monetary penalties as well as equitable remedies for the affected plan. Section 4975 of the Code prohibits certain transactions involving plans (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, which includes individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans) and service providers, including fiduciaries, to such plans. Section 4975 of the Code imposes excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions. 
On June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest (“Reg. BI”), elevating the standard of care for broker-dealers from the current “suitability” requirement to a “best interest” standard when making a recommendation of any securities transaction to a retail customer. The “best interest” standard requires a broker-dealer to make recommendations without putting its financial interests ahead of the interests of a retail customer. The SEC also adopted Form CRS Relationship Summary (“Form CRS”), which requires registered investment advisers (“RIAs”) and broker-dealers to deliver to retail investors a succinct, plain English summary about the relationship and services provided by the firm and the required standard of conduct associated with the relationship and services. In connection with adopting Reg. BI, the SEC added new record-making and recordkeeping rules. The 
Blucora, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K 


Table of Contents

compliance date for Reg. BI and its related rules was June 30, 2020. Reg. BI heightens the standard of care for broker-dealers when making investment recommendations and imposes disclosure and policy and procedural obligations that impact the compensation our Wealth Management business and its representatives receive for selling certain types of products, particularly those that offer different compensation across different share classes (such as mutual funds and variable annuities). In addition, Reg. BI prohibits a broker-dealer and its associated persons from using the term “adviser” or “advisor” if the broker-dealer is not an RIA or the associated person is not a supervised person of an RIA. This prohibition required us to change the titles of certain of our advisors. The implementation of the regulations required us to create, review, and modify certain policies and procedures and review and change the products that we offer, and also resulted in associated increases in training and supervisory and compliance controls, all of which lead to additional costs and may lead to decreased revenue. In addition to the SEC, various state securities and insurance regulators have proposed or are considering adopting laws and regulations seeking to impose new standards of conduct on broker-dealers and insurance agencies that, as written, differ from the SEC’s new regulations and may lead to additional implementation costs if adopted. For further discussion of the risks to our business related to Reg. BI, see the paragraph in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the heading “Our Wealth Management business is subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with these regulations or interpretations thereof could have a Material Adverse Effect.”
Our Tax Preparation segment is subject to federal and state government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. We are also required to comply with Federal Trade Commission requirements and a variety of state revenue agency standards. In addition, we offer certain other products and services to small businesses and consumers, which are also subject to regulatory requirements. As we expand our products and services, we may become subject to additional government regulation. Further, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations, or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours or expand to cover additional products and services. These increased regulatory requirements could impose higher regulatory compliance costs, limitations on our ability to provide some services in some states or countries, and liabilities that might be incurred through lawsuits or regulatory penalties. 
We are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may have an impact on our operations.
See the section entitled “Risks Associated With Our Businesses” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding governmental regulation of our business and risks related to such regulation.
Privacy and Security of Customer Information and Transactions
Regulatory activity in the areas of privacy and data protection continues to grow worldwide, driven in part by the growth of technology and related concerns about the rapid and widespread dissemination and use of information. To the extent they are applicable to us, we must comply with various federal, state, and international laws and regulations and to financial institution and healthcare provider regulatory requirements relating to the privacy and security of the personal information of our customers and employees. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, federal and state labor and employment laws, state data breach notification laws, and state privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, the New York Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security (SHIELD) Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, SEC Regulation S-P, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, as amended, and Regulation S-ID, and further potential federal and state requirements.
Many of these laws and regulations provide consumers and employees with a private right of action if a covered company suffers a data breach related to a failure to implement reasonable data security measures. In addition, we are subject to other privacy laws and regulations that apply to internet advertising, online behavioral tracking, mobile applications, messaging, telemarketing, email communication, data hosting, data retention, financial and health information, and credit reporting. The legal framework around privacy issues is rapidly evolving, as various federal and state government bodies are considering adopting new privacy laws and regulations, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store, or transmit the personal information and other data of our customers or employees. These laws could also affect the ways we communicate with our customers, deliver products and services, and could significantly increase our compliance

costs. As our business expands to new industry segments or otherwise becomes subject to rules and regulations of jurisdictions outside the United States with stricter data protection regimes, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, our compliance requirements and costs will increase. 
Through a privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with the principles of individual consent, data subject access, and privacy-by-design, we strive to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of, and can control, how we use personal information about them. The TaxAct.com website and its digital products have been certified by TRUSTe, an independent organization that offers certification to organizations that have demonstrated responsible data collection and processing practices consistent with regulatory expectations and external standards for privacy accountability. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to influence public policy, for privacy and security.
To address data security concerns, we use standard data security safeguards to help protect our computer systems and the information customers give to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers transmit credit card information or tax return data to us through one of our websites or products, we use industry-standard encryption as the data is transmitted to us. We work to protect our computer systems from unauthorized internal or external access using commercially-available computer security products as well as internally-developed security procedures and practices.
See the section entitled “Risks Associated With Our Businesses” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding risks related to privacy and security of customer information and transactions.
Intellectual Property
Our success is bolstered by our technology and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect such rights and the value of our corporate brands and reputation through a variety of measures, including: domain name registrations, confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with employees and third parties, protective contractual provisions, and laws regarding copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. We hold multiple registered trademarks in the United States and in various foreign countries, and we may apply for additional trademarks as business needs require. See the section entitled “Risks Associated With Our Businesses” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights and defending third-party infringement claims.
Human Capital
We strive to attract, develop, and retain the most talented employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits that support their health, financial, and emotional well-being. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. As of December 31, 2020, we had 846 full-time employees.
Employee and Board Diversity. Diversity serves as an integral component of our human capital objectives, and we seek to promote an inclusive work environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. As of December 31, 2020, 42% of our employee base, including 34% of our senior leadership team, was female, and 34% of our employee base was comprised of individuals with ethnically or racially diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2020, 63% of the independent members of our Board of Directors were either female, or racially or ethnically diverse, and 63% of our executive leadership reporting to our chief executive officer were either female or ethnically and racially diverse. During 2020, we established a diversity and inclusion advisory council made up of a diverse group of employees and led by diverse executive sponsors. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives have already led to the roll out of diversity and inclusion focused engagements and increased focus on diversity and inclusion as part of our hiring and promotions process.
Utilization of Independent Contractors and Referring Representatives. Our Wealth Management business distributes its products and services and generates a substantial portion of its revenues through a nationwide network of 3,770 financial professionals as of December 31, 2020. Of these 3,770 financial professionals, 3,748 financial professionals either: (1) partner with Avantax Wealth Management and operate as independent contractors, or (2) partner with Avantax Planning Partners and operate as licensed referring representatives. We believe that our ability to attract, retain, support, and compensate these independent financial professionals and licensed referring representatives will continue to contribute to the growth and success of our Wealth Management business.

Human Capital Optimization During the COVID-19 Pandemic. While the COVID-19 pandemic did impact our human capital management practices in 2020, we believe we are able to effectively conduct our business while operating in a largely work-from-home environment. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted safety protocols and procedures for our essential employees who continued to work onsite. We also greatly enhanced our communication programs to create open communication at all levels of our business, which enabled our employees to achieve their professional objectives while also maintaining a healthy work-from-home lifestyle. In addition, there were no employee layoffs in calendar year 2020 that were directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that retaining our strong employee team and the continued transformation of our culture will accelerate our business transformation.
