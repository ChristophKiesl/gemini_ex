ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
DXC, a Nevada corporation, is a global IT services market leader. Our more than 130,000 people in 70-plus countries help our global customers, over half of today’s fortune 500 companies, run mission-critical systems with the latest technology innovations across our Enterprise Technology Stack.
Our customers trust DXC to innovate and deliver transformative solutions for new levels of performance, profitability, competitiveness, and customer experience.
DXC was formed on April 1, 2017 by the merger of CSC and HPES (the "HPES Merger").
Transformation Journey
The DXC “Transformation Journey” strategy focuses on building stronger relationships with customers, its people, and unlocking value across the Enterprise Technology Stack.
Key transformation journey priorities include: 
•Inspire and Take Care of our People – Ensuring the health and safety of our people is a top priority, especially in the current environment
Continuing to bring in new technology, account and delivery talent across the world, and making investments that recognize and reward our people
•Focus on Customers – Strengthening our customer relationships and ensuring we are proactively delivering for customers
•Optimize Cost – Optimizing value to better serve our customers by eliminating confusion and complexity
•Seize the Market – Seizing the market opportunity by cross-selling and expanding what we do with our customers across the Enterprise Technology Stack
•Unlock Value to Strengthen Balance Sheet – Unlocking value by pursuing strategic alternatives, rationalizing our portfolio, and strengthening our balance sheet through our commitment to running a long-term sustainable business
The Company will continue to focus on execution of its strategy in the next fiscal year, with a continued focus on our people, revenue stabilization, cost optimization and winning in the market. While the Company has already disclosed that it completed the sale of two businesses that comprised the Strategic Alternatives plan, the Company will continue its portfolio shaping efforts and divest assets that the Company does not believe are well integrated with its enterprise technology stack and its strategic direction so it can focus on its strategy. 
Important Acquisitions and Divestitures
During fiscal 2021, DXC completed the sale of its U.S. State and Local Health and Human Services business ("HHS" or the "HHS Business") to Veritas Capital Fund Management, L.L.C. ("Veritas Capital") to form Gainwell Technologies. The sale was accomplished by the cash purchase of all equity interests and assets attributable to the HHS Business together with future services to be provided by the Company for a total enterprise value of $5.0 billion, subject to net working capital adjustments and assumed liabilities.
On July 17, 2020, DXC entered into a purchase agreement with Dedalus Holding S.p.A. ("Dedalus"), a company organized under the laws of Italy, pursuant to which Dedalus will acquire DXC’s healthcare provider software business (the "HPS" or the "HPS Business"). The sale was completed on April 1, 2021, for a purchase price of €462 million (approximately $543 million) (the "HPS Sale"). 
During fiscal 2020, DXC completed the acquisition of Luxoft Holding, Inc., a global scale digital service provider whose offerings encompass strategic consulting, custom software development, and digital solution engineering services. We also completed other acquisitions during fiscal 2020 to complement our offerings and to provide opportunities for future growth.

See Note 20 - "Segment and Geographic Information" for additional information related to our reportable segments, including the disclosure of segment revenues, segment profit, and financial information by geographic area.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services to customers through our direct sales force, operating out of locations around the world. Our customers include commercial businesses of many sizes and in many industries and public sector enterprises. No individual customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, or fiscal 2019.
Seasonality
General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. The markets in which we sell our solutions, services and productions occasionally experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We also experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our services. For example, contract awards and certain revenue are often tied to the timing of our customers' fiscal year-ends, and we also experience seasonality related to our own fiscal year-end selling activities.
Competition 
The IT and professional services markets we compete in are highly competitive and are not dominated by a single company or a small number of companies. A substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those we offer. In addition, the increased importance of offshore labor centers has brought several foreign-based competitors into our markets.
Our competitors include:
•large multinational enterprises that offer some or all of the services and solutions that we offer;
•smaller companies that offer focused services and solutions similar to those that we offer;
•offshore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India that sell directly to end-users;
•solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific industry segment or service area; and
•in-house functions of corporations that use their own resources rather than engaging an outside IT services provider.
The principal methods of competition in the markets for our solutions and services include:
•vision and strategic advisory ability;
•integrated solutions capabilities;
•performance and reliability;
•global and diverse talent;
•delivery excellence and ongoing support;
•responsiveness to customer needs;
•competitive pricing of services;
•technical and industry expertise;
•reputation and experience;
•quality of solutions and services; and
•financial stability and strong corporate governance.
Our ability to obtain new business and retain existing business is dependent upon the following:
•technology, industry and systems know-how with an independent perspective on best solutions across software, hardware, and service providers;
•ability to offer improved strategic frameworks and technical solutions;
•investments in our services and solutions;
•focus on responsiveness to proactively address customer needs, quality of services and competitive prices;
•successful management of our relationships with leading strategic and solution partners in hardware, networking, cloud, applications and software;
•project management experience and capabilities, including delivery;
•end-to-end spectrum of IT and professional services we provide; and
•financial stability and strong corporate governance.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to protect our business interests. While our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection, we do selectively seek patent protection for certain inventions likely to be incorporated into products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position.
As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across the patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our solutions and services and enhancing our freedom to sell solutions and services in markets in which we choose to participate. No single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any business segment.
Additionally, we own or have rights to various trademarks, service marks, and trade names that are used in the operation of our business. We also own or have the rights to copyrights that protect the content of our products and other proprietary materials.
In addition to developing our intellectual property portfolio, we license intellectual property rights from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and plan to continue to grant licenses to others under our intellectual property rights when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local, and foreign laws concerning the environment and sustainability, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial position; and, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. However, we could incur substantial costs including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims if we were to violate or become liable under existing and future environmental laws or legislation.
Human Capital Management
As a leading global information technology services company, we attract highly skilled and educated people. As of March 31, 2021, we employed approximately 134,000 people worldwide. At DXC our people are our number one asset - ensuring they feel valued and respected.
Value of Employee Engagement
We value our people and take various actions for employee engagement. We assess employee engagement at least annually through a global engagement survey. During the past year, 77% of our people participated in the survey, which resulted in an Employee Engagement Index measuring 72%. Based on feedback received through periodic engagement surveys, management has implemented several initiatives to improve the employee experience from rewards and recognition, communications and process improvement. Various platforms like Global Talent Management, Coaching & Mentoring, Career Development programs, and global recognition are also used to improve employee experiences and engagement.
Management During COVID-19
We are committed to keeping our people safe and well. DXC employees are equipped and enabled to work virtually and flexibly from home today and continue to deliver results for our customers. Science and data will remain the drivers of our approach as we continue to navigate through COVID-19, and ensure the safety and well-being of our people. We will remain flexible and ready to react quickly if required to deliver for our customers. We recognize that this is an opportunity for DXC to change the employee experience in an impactful way.
Training and Education
We view professional development as a corporate responsibility — a strategic investment in our employees’ and the company’s future. Through our global learning management ecosystem, we offer hundreds of learning programs as well as a career development system to help employees reach their potential. Providing ways to learn, grow, and explore new and challenging opportunities contribute to our ability to retain a motivated, knowledgeable workforce. Assessing employee abilities and contributions is a cornerstone of development at DXC. Our self-directed learning culture encourages employees to learn at their own pace and in a learning environment of their preference. Key to our people development is the role managers play – we remain focused on equipping and enabling our people leaders to ensure our people have leaders that guide and support them in their development and success.
Inclusion & Diversity
We are committed to an Inclusive and Diverse workforce. The DXC Global Diversity and Non-Discrimination Policy guides our engagement in management and hiring practices that promote diversity and inclusion.
Human Rights
We are committed to the protection and advancement of human rights and to ensuring that our operations in communities around the world function with integrity. DXC is firmly committed to preventing the exploitation of vulnerable groups. Our main human rights–related focus areas are promoting good practice through our large and diverse global supply chain and supporting a diverse and inclusive corporate culture.
