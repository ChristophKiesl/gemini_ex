ITEM 1. | Business

We are a leading provider of cloud-based platform solutions designed to help small- and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, succeed online. We serve approximately 4.8 million subscribers globally with a range of products and services that help SMBs get online, get found and grow their businesses. In addition to for-profit businesses, our subscribers include non-profit organizations, community groups, bloggers, and hobbyists. Although we provide our solutions through a number of brands, we are focusing our marketing, engineering and product development efforts on a small number of strategic assets, including our Constant Contact, Bluehost, HostGator, and Domain.com brands.
From fiscal year 2017 through the end of fiscal year 2019, we have reported our business results in three reportable segments, as follows: 
Web Presence. Our web presence segment consists primarily of our web hosting brands, including Bluehost and HostGator. This segment also includes related products such as domain names, website security, website design tools and services, and e-commerce products.
Email Marketing. Our email marketing segment consists of Constant Contact email marketing tools and related products. This segment also generates revenue from sales of our Constant Contact-branded website builder tool and our Ecomdash inventory management and marketplace listing solution, or Ecomdash, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2019. For most of 2019, the email marketing segment also included the SinglePlatform digital storefront business, which we sold on December 5, 2019.
Domain. Our domain segment consists of domain-focused brands such as Domain.com, ResellerClub and LogicBoxes as well as certain web hosting brands that are under common management with our domain-focused brands. This segment sells domain names and domain management services to resellers and end users, as well as premium domain names, and also generates advertising revenue from domain name parking. It also resells domain names and domain management services to our web presence segment.
In the second half of 2019, we started the process of simplifying our organization to support our two key strategic platforms, web presence (including our web hosting and domain offerings) and email marketing. In 2020, we plan to modify our internal reporting structure to reflect these changes in our structure and leadership, and also to change the name of the email marketing segment to the "digital marketing" segment. This will result in consolidation of our current domain segment into our web presence segment, such that we expect to report our financial results in two segments - web presence (including domains) and digital marketing - beginning with the first quarter of 2020. 
You can find more information about our reportable segments in Note 21, Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our Market, Products and Services 
SMBs represent a large and diverse market, both in the United States and internationally. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, there were approximately 30.7 million small businesses in the United States in 2016. Of these small businesses, approximately 24.8 million were non-employer firms, or companies that do not have paid employees. In addition, in 2015, the International Labour Organization of the United Nations estimated that there were between 420 and 510 million small and medium-sized enterprises (defined as one to 250 employees) worldwide.
Many SMBs have limited technological and marketing expertise, time and financial resources. However, we believe SMBs understand that the Internet and the proliferation of mobile devices are changing the way consumers discover and transact with businesses, making an effective online presence critical. 
We provide our products and services through two strategic platforms: web presence (which consists of the web presence and domain segments) and email marketing (which corresponds to our email marketing segment). Our offerings, which consist of both proprietary applications and third-party products, are designed to help SMBs succeed online at every stage of their business. 
Web Hosting. By providing a set of core products that combine storage, bandwidth and processing power, our entry-level shared hosting services enable subscribers to create an initial web presence quickly and cost-effectively. Our shared hosting packages offer several options for building a website, including our website builder (discussed below) and a variety of Wordpress hosting packages.
In addition to providing shared hosting services, we also provide virtual private server, or VPS, hosting and dedicated hosting solutions. As a subscriber’s business expands and the demands on its website increase, these more customizable 
and higher performance solutions allow our subscribers to build additional functionality into their websites, offer high bandwidth content and drive more commerce and marketing activities while reducing load times and increasing site speeds. Subscribers can start with an advanced web hosting solution or upgrade from an existing shared hosting service. 
Website Builder. Our website builder tool allows customers to quickly create a customized, professional-looking website. Users of our website builder can also take advantage of our logomaker tool, which generates a range of customizable business logos that can be automatically integrated into websites and email marketing templates, and a range of other products to promote their business, such as an email marketing tool powered by Constant Contact, search engine marketing, search engine optimization, and Google My Business.
Domain Registration, Management and Resale. As an accredited domain registrar with approximately 11.3 million domains under management at December 31, 2019, we enable our subscribers to search and purchase available domain names from a wide spectrum of domain registries. We also offer domain privacy, which allows customers to register a domain name without publicly listing their name and contact information, and domain protection, which helps customers avoid inadvertently failing to renew a domain name due to outdated credit card or contact information. In addition, we maintain a portfolio of premium domains that are available for resale. 
Email Marketing. Our Constant Contact email marketing solutions allow small businesses and other organizations to easily create, send and track professional-looking email campaigns, allowing them to communicate effectively with their customers and potential customers via email. Email marketing services available to subscribers include building and segmenting mailing lists, designing and managing email newsletters, scheduling and sending email messages, and reporting and tracking the results of each campaign. We also provide a library of third party integrations that allow subscribers to easily import, sync, and manage their contacts from external databases, manage events online, and conduct surveys. Our subscribers can also take advantage of our website builder tool and Constant Contact Marketing Advisor, which allows them to speak live by phone or online chat with a marketing advisor to get the guidance they need. 
E-commerce Enablement. We offer products that enable our subscribers to sell their products and services online, including secure and encrypted payments, shopping carts, inventory management, online marketplace listing solutions, payment processing and related services and mobile payments. We also feature products that help our subscribers maximize their sales opportunities, including segmentation tools that allow email marketing campaigns to target specific categories of shoppers, and customized “buy now” pages that can be embedded into an email newsletter.
Security. We offer malware protection solutions to help our subscribers safeguard their websites from viruses, malicious code and other threats, as well as web application firewalls, which can help prevent attacks on subscriber websites before they affect subscriber data or operations. We also offer Secure Socket Layer, or SSL, certificates that encrypt data collected on a website, for subscribers that collect personally identifiable information or other private data from their customers and website visitors. We provide a free basic SSL certificate to substantially all of our web hosting, domain and website builder customers, and we offer premium SSL packages for customers seeking additional features. 
Site Back-Up. We offer backup control solutions that enable subscribers to schedule, maintain, manage and restore backups of their online data and websites. 
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Search Engine Marketing (SEM). We offer a variety of search engine optimization and marketing solutions that can improve a subscriber’s ability to be discovered by potential customers. These services help a subscriber distribute its business profile to online directories and manage links and keywords with on-page diagnostic tools. We also offer pay-per-click (PPC) services designed to direct traffic to a subscriber’s website. 
Mobile. We offer solutions that allow our subscribers to have their websites and email marketing campaigns rendered on mobile devices and target mobile customers for their businesses, among other features and functionality. Our website builder solutions offer mobile-ready templates, which enable small businesses to ensure that their websites render well on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Subscribers can also manage their websites and email marketing campaigns while on the go, both through mobile browsers and native apps. 
Social Media. We offer tools and services that help our subscribers to communicate effectively with their customers and potential customers through social networks and to coordinate their website and email marketing efforts with their social media presence. 
Productivity Solutions. We offer our subscribers a range of leading business productivity tools, including Microsoft Office 365 and G Suite by Google Cloud. These tools include, among others, professional email, word processing and presentation software, online storage, shared calendars, and video meetings. 
Analytics. We offer control panels and dashboards that provide our subscribers with tools to analyze activity on their websites. 
Professional Services. We offer professional services for subscribers who want additional assistance establishing and growing their online presence, including website design, marketing services (including assistance with search engine optimization and search engine marketing), social media management services, and website migration services. 
Sales & Marketing
Although we operate through numerous brands, we are focusing our marketing expenditures on our strategic brands, which include Constant Contact, Bluehost, HostGator and Domain.com.
For our web presence segment, the majority of our program marketing expense has historically been associated with targeted online search marketing, including for inclusion of our brands in online directories, and with payments to our large network of referral partners, who drive subscribers to us on a paid referral basis. Payments to our referral partners primarily occur after a subscriber signs up on our platform and therefore allow us to readily determine the returns on our marketing spend. We also attract new subscribers through word-of-mouth referrals and through partnerships that help us reach additional subscribers, such as our partnerships with Google and WordPress. 
For our email marketing segment, we market our products and acquire our customers through a variety of sources, including online marketing, such as search engines and advertising on social media, YouTube, and other websites, offline marketing through television and radio advertising, partner relationships, outbound sales efforts, referrals from our customer base, general brand awareness and a link to our website in the footer of substantially all of the emails sent by our customers. We have partner relationships with over 10,000 local and national small business service providers. These partners refer customers to us through links on their websites and outbound promotions to their customers or allow us to market to their customers directly. Our online, television, and radio advertising is designed to educate potential customers about our email marketing solutions and raise awareness of our brand.
For our domain segment, we use a combination of online search marketing and a network of referral partners, as well as joint marketing efforts with registries of various generic top level domain names, such as ".com", aimed at increasing subscribers.
Subscriber Support 
Our support agents assist our subscribers via phone, email, chat and social media. Our support personnel not only assist subscribers with technical issues, but also focus on understanding the business goals of each subscriber to help identify the right products and services to achieve those goals. Our primary support centers are located in Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Brazil and India. In addition, we have third-party support arrangements in India, the Philippines and China. 
Technology Platform and Infrastructure
The primary technology platforms supporting our web presence and domain segments combine open source and proprietary software, and are based on a scalable architecture that allows us to operate with a large number of subscribers per server. In addition, we use subscriber relationship management, billing and subscriber service support systems to on-board, serve and track our subscribers, and to enable them to manage their own service experience. We currently serve most of our web presence and domain subscribers from five U.S.-based data centers, one of which is owned by us and the rest of which are co-located. 
For our most of email marketing segment, we use a central application and a single software code base with unique accounts for each subscriber. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of providing our products across our email marketing customer base. In addition, because we have one central application, we believe we are able to scale our business to meet increases in demand for our products. We own all of the hardware deployed in support of our platform. Our production system hardware and the disaster recovery hardware for our production system are co-located in third-party hosting facilities in Massachusetts and Texas.
Our website builder and our Ecomdash inventory management and marketplace listing solution are hosted on public cloud services. 
Subscriber Profile 
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 4.8 million subscribers, of which approximately 3.6 million were web presence subscribers, 0.5 million were email marketing segment subscribers and 0.7 million were domain segment subscribers. Based on data from a 2018 survey of subscribers of our major web presence brands, we believe a majority of our web presence subscribers are SMBs, most of whom are businesses with five or fewer employees. We estimate that over 70% of subscribers of our email marketing segment employ 25 or fewer employees. 
The industries in which our subscribers operate are very diverse, including retail, restaurants, professional services, non-profits, merchandising, media, recreation, education, construction, health, beauty and wellness, and arts and entertainment, 
among others. In addition to for-profit businesses, our subscribers include non-profit organizations, community groups, bloggers, and hobbyists.
Geographical Information 
We currently maintain offices and conduct operations primarily in the United States, Brazil, India, and the Netherlands. We also have third-party support arrangements in India, the Philippines, and China. For additional information about our geographic areas, see Note 22, Geographic and Other Information, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Competition 
The global cloud-based services market for SMBs is highly competitive and constantly evolving. For our web presence and domain segments, we expect continued competition, both domestically and internationally, from a number of sources, including the following: 

• | competitors in the domain, hosting and website builder markets such as GoDaddy, Ionos by 1&1, Wix, Squarespace, Weebly (now owned by Square), and Web.com;


• | Wordpress.com and Wordpress-focused hosting companies such as WPEngine and SiteGround;


• | e-commerce, payments, email marketing, and marketing automation companies that are expanding their offerings to include website builders or other web presence offerings;


• | cloud hosting providers; and


• | large companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which offer web hosting or website builders, domain registration and other cloud-based services, and Facebook, which offers an Internet marketing platform.

For our email marketing segment, we expect continued competition from MailChimp and other SMB-focused email marketing vendors, as well as additional competition from providers of marketing automation software and web presence competitors who are expanding their offerings to include email marketing functionality. 
 Competitors in each of our segments are expanding their offerings into adjacent products and services in order to provide a more comprehensive set of business solutions for SMBs, and in some cases, companies that previously competed with us in one of our segments are now competing with us in most or all of them. In addition, marketing automation, ecommerce, payments and other online services companies that have not competed with us in the past are expanding into our market by providing website builder and email marketing tools, and by enhancing offerings tailored for SMBs. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in the cloud-based services market for SMBs include: ease of use and effectiveness; availability of integrated, comprehensive solutions; product functionality, performance and reliability; customer service and support; brand awareness and reputation; affordability; and product scalability. In some instances, we have commercial partnerships with companies with which we also compete. 
See Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors for additional discussion of competition as it pertains to our business.
Seasonality 
Our web presence and domain segments have historically experienced moderately increased subscriber billings in the first quarter of our fiscal year as many subscribers start businesses at the beginning of a new year. These segments record a significant portion of these billings as deferred revenue and recognize the deferred revenue throughout the course of the year and beyond based on the term of the applicable subscription. This slight seasonality has a favorable impact on our operating cash flows in the early part of each fiscal year, and an unfavorable impact in the latter part of each fiscal year. We expect that this seasonality will continue. 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies, confidential information, brands and other intellectual property. 
We use open source technologies pursuant to applicable licenses as the basis for our technology platform. We have also developed, acquired or licensed proprietary technologies for use in our business. As of January 15, 2020, we have eighteen U.S. patents as well as one pending U.S. patent application and several pending foreign counterpart applications relating to aspects of our technology platform and offerings, including our shared services architecture, predictive analytics methods, virtualization technologies, subscriber migration technologies, web presence improvement technologies, and email composition and editing technologies. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of the technologies they cover. 
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established through years of use. In addition, we have a trademark and service mark enforcement program pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours. 
We have non-disclosure, confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, subscribers and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information; however, unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information or proprietary technologies by our employees or third parties could still occur. In addition, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary rights. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as we expand outside of the United States. 
Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap across industries. Third parties, including non-practicing patent holders, have claimed, and could claim in the future, that our processes, technologies or websites infringe patents they now hold or might obtain or that might be issued in the future. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional discussion about the substantial costs that we could incur as a result of any claim of infringement of another party’s intellectual property rights.
Laws and Regulations 
Advertising and promotional information presented on our websites, in our products, and in our other marketing and promotional activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws regulating unfair and deceptive acts or practices. U.S. federal, state, and foreign legislatures have also adopted laws and regulations regulating numerous other aspects of our business. Regulations relating to the Internet, including laws governing user privacy and data protection, unsolicited commercial email (spam), and online content and liability for third-party online activities, are particularly relevant to our business. Such laws and regulations are discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
Consumer Protection Laws. We are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations that regulate our marketing practices and/or prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including under the auspices of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC; the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA; the Telemarketing Sales Rule; and state consumer protection statutes. These laws and regulations require, among other things, certain disclosures or functionality in our brand websites, customer communications, and the ordering process for our products; obtaining customer consent prior to placing sales calls or sending text messages to wireless numbers; and compliance with “do not call” or “do not contact” laws or requests from individuals. We are also subject to consumer protection laws outside of the United States, which may include privacy and data protection laws, telemarketing laws, regulation of cloud services, e-commerce and distance selling regulation, advertising regulation, unfair competition rules or similar legislation.
Privacy and Data Protection. We collect personally identifiable information and other data from our subscribers and prospective subscribers, as well as from their customers and contacts. We use this information to provide services to our subscribers, to support, expand and improve our business and (subject to each subscriber’s or prospective subscriber’s, or their customers' or contacts', right to decline or opt out) we may use this information to market other products and services to them or to assist our subscribers in marketing their own products and services to their customers and contacts. We may also share subscribers’ personally identifiable information with certain third parties as directed by the subscriber or as described in our privacy notice. In addition, the data we collect from or about our employees as part of our standard human resources procedures is also subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including evolving California laws and EU laws on data export.
The U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed guidelines or rules for the collection, distribution, use and storage of information collected from or about consumers or their devices. The FTC and various U.S. state and local governments and agencies regularly use their authority under laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive marketing and trade practices to investigate and penalize companies for practices related to the collection, use, handling, disclosure, dissemination and security of personal data of U.S. consumers. For example, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 2, 2020 and can be enforced by the Attorney General as of July 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and offer them new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, as well as to request access to or deletion of their personal information. The law also affords consumers qualified rights to seek liquidated penalties if unauthorized parties gain access to their unredacted, unencrypted personally identifiable information by reason of our failure to adopt and maintain reasonable security measures. Further legislative changes in California, or in other U.S. states, are under consideration. In this highly dynamic legislative, regulatory, and litigation environment, we cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies in varying ways across our business and brands, and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply, or if we become subject to governmental enforcement or private party litigation.
In addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the countries of the European Union, or EU, Canada, and Brazil, have adopted data protection laws and regulations different from and more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, export, disclosure and security of personal data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information, and, in some jurisdictions, certain unique identifiers. These laws and regulations are subject to revisions and differing interpretations, and have generally become more stringent over time. Furthermore, additional countries and other jurisdictions are considering the adoption of similar laws and regulations.
In May 2018, the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect. The GDPR implemented more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, increased requirements to erase an individual’s information upon request and comply with other requests from individuals, mandatory data breach notification requirements, restrictions on automated decision-making and profiling, and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. The GDPR has also imposed more stringent consent requirements related to cookies and similar technologies. Penalties under the GDPR are significant: fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, may be imposed. Moreover, under certain circumstances, we may be considered liable for non-compliance by our third-party partners with the GDPR or other privacy laws and regulations.
Anti-SPAM Laws. We are subject to the U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, which establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. The CAN-SPAM Act, among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future emails from the sender, and carries significant penalties for violations. In addition, some states and countries have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act, such as Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, or CASL, and the GDPR. These types of laws are particularly significant for our email marketing segment.
Laws Relating to Online Content and Liability for Third Party Activities. Our role as a provider of cloud-based solutions, including website hosting services, domain registration services and email marketing, may subject us to potential liability for the activities of our subscribers on or in connection with their websites or domain names or for the data they store on or send using our servers. Although our subscriber terms of use prohibit illegal use of our services by our subscribers and permit us to take down websites or take other appropriate actions for illegal use, subscribers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload, transmit or store content with us in violation of applicable law, third-party rights, or the subscriber’s own policies, which could subject us to liability. Several U.S. federal statutes apply to us with respect to various subscriber activities:

• | The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, or DMCA, provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed on the Internet. Under the DMCA, based on our current business activity as an online service provider that does not monitor, own or control website content posted by our subscribers, we generally are not liable for copyright infringing content posted by our subscribers or other third parties, provided that we follow the procedures for handling copyright infringement claims set forth in the DMCA. Generally, if we receive a proper notice from, or on behalf of, a copyright owner alleging infringement of copyrighted material located on websites we host, and we fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the safe harbor provided by the DMCA, the copyright owner may seek to impose liability on us.


• | The Communications Decency Act of 1996, or CDA, generally protects interactive computer service providers such as us, from liability for certain online activities of their customers, such as the publication of defamatory or other objectionable content. As an interactive computer services provider, we do not monitor hosted websites or prescreen the content placed by our subscribers on their sites. Accordingly, under the CDA, we are generally not responsible for the subscriber-created content hosted on our servers. However, the CDA does not apply in foreign jurisdictions, and legislation such as the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017, or FOSTA, as well as new legislation that may be enacted in the future, may reduce the immunity provided to us by the CDA.


• | In addition to the CDA, the Securing the Protection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage Act, or the SPEECH Act, provides a statutory exception to the enforcement by a U.S. court of a foreign judgment that is less protective of free speech than the United States. Generally, the exception applies if the law applied in the foreign court did not provide at least as much protection for freedom of speech and press as would be provided by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or by the constitution and law of the state in which the U.S. court is located, or if no finding of a violation would be supported under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or under the constitution and law of the state in which the U.S. court is located. Although the SPEECH Act may protect us from

the enforcement of foreign judgments in the United States, it does not affect the enforceability of the judgment in the foreign country that issued the judgment.
See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for more information about our legal and regulatory risks. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2019, we had 3,762 employees, including 1,786 in support and network operations, 766 in sales and marketing, 747 in engineering and development, and 463 in general and administrative. Excluded from our employee figures are approximately 1,500 individuals primarily located in India and the Philippines who are directly employed by third parties and perform a range of services for us, including email-, phone- and chat-based customer and technical support, billing support, network monitoring and engineering and development services. Most of our employees are based in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Corporate Information
Our business was founded in 1997 as a Delaware corporation under the name Innovative Marketing Technologies Incorporated. In December 2011, investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus and Goldman, Sachs & Co. acquired a controlling interest in our company. Prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, in October 2013, we were an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of WP Expedition Topco L.P., a Delaware limited partnership that we refer to as WP Expedition Topco. Pursuant to the terms of a corporate reorganization that we completed prior to our IPO, WP Expedition Topco dissolved and in liquidation distributed the shares of common stock of Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. to its partners in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of WP Expedition Topco. We have completed numerous acquisitions since inception, including the acquisition of Constant Contact, Inc. in February 2016.
Our principal executive offices are located at 10 Corporate Drive, Suite 300, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803 and our telephone number at that address is (781) 852-3200.
