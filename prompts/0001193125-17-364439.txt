Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

OVERVIEW 
 IES Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that owns and manages operating subsidiaries in business activities across a variety of end-markets. Our operations are currently organized into four principal business segments, based upon the nature of our current services: 
 

 | Commercial & Industrial  Provider of electrical and mechanical design, construction, and maintenance services to the commercial and industrial markets in various regional markets and nationwide in certain areas of expertise, such as the power infrastructure market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Communications  Nationwide provider of technology infrastructure services to large corporations and independent businesses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Infrastructure Solutions  Provider of electro-mechanical solutions for industrial operations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Residential  Regional provider of electrical installation services for single-family housing and multi-family apartment complexes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our businesses are managed in a decentralized manner. While sharing common goals and values, each of the Companys segments manages its own day-to-day operations. Our corporate office is focused on significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and selection of segment leadership, as well as strategic and operational improvement initiatives and the establishment and monitoring of risk management practices within our segments. 
 IES Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware corporation established in 1997 and headquartered in Houston, Texas, with an executive office in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
 CORPORATE STRATEGY 
 We seek to create shareholder value through improving operating margins and generating free cash flow by investing in our existing businesses and completing acquisitions. We seek to acquire or invest in stand-alone platform companies based in North America or acquire businesses that strategically complement our existing business segments. In evaluating potential acquisition candidates, we seek to invest in businesses with, among other characteristics: 

 | proven management with a willingness to continue post-acquisition;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | low technological and/or product obsolescence risk;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | established market position and sustainable competitive advantages; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | strong cash flow characteristics.
--+----------------------------------

 We believe that acquisitions provide an opportunity to expand into new end markets and diversify our revenue and profit streams, which we expect will allow us to maximize the value of our significant net operating loss tax carry forwards (NOLs). While we may use acquisitions to build our presence in the industries we serve, we will also consider potential acquisitions in other industries, which could result in changes in our operations from those historically conducted by us. 
 Recent Transactions 
 In fiscal 2017, we acquired three businesses for aggregate consideration of $21.0 million, as described below: 
 

 | An 80% interest in NEXT Electric, LLC (NEXT Electric), a Wisconsin-based electrical contractor specializing in the design, installation and maintenance of electrical systems for commercial, industrial, healthcare, water treatment and education end-markets, was acquired in July 2017 in our Commercial & Industrial segment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4 


 
 | Technical Services II, LLC (Technical Services), a Virginia-based provider of mechanical maintenance services, including commercial heating, ventilation and air conditioning, food service equipment, electrical and plumbing services, was acquired in June 2017 in our Commercial & Industrial segment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Freeman Enclosure Systems, LLC, an Ohio-based manufacturer of custom generator enclosures primarily used by data centers and large commercial and industrial facilities, was acquired in March 2017 along with its affiliate Strategic Edge, LLC (together, Freeman) in our Infrastructure Solutions segment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For more information on these transactions, please see Note 18, Business Combinations and Divestitures in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Controlling Shareholder 
 A majority of our outstanding common stock is owned by Tontine Associates, L.L.C. and its affiliates (collectively, Tontine). Based on a Form 4 filed on October 3, 2017, Tontine owns approximately 58% of the Company. As a result, Tontine can control most of our affairs, including most actions requiring the approval of shareholders, such as the approval of any potential merger or sale of all or substantially all assets, segments, or the Company itself. Most of Tontines shares are registered for resale on a shelf registration statement filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Tontines sale of all or any portion of its shares could result in a change of control, which would trigger the change of control provisions in a number of our material agreements, including our credit facility, bonding agreements with our sureties and our executive severance plan. For more information see Note 3, Controlling Shareholder in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Net Operating Loss Tax Carry Forward and Other Deferred Tax Assets 
 The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have an estimated federal net operating loss (NOL) of approximately $378.3 million at September 30, 2017, including approximately $142.1 million resulting from the additional amortization of personal goodwill. 
 In fiscal 2016, we released a significant valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize our deferred tax assets may lead to the recording of additional valuation allowances in future periods and a reduction in income under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Further, any future reduction in the federal statutory tax rate could also cause a reduction in the economic benefit of the NOL and other deferred tax assets available to us and a corresponding charge to reduce the book value of the deferred tax asset recorded on our balance sheet. The US House of Representatives and Senate have each passed tax reform legislation which, if enacted, would reduce the corporate income tax rate to 20%, from a current rate of 35%. At September 30, 2017, we had deferred tax assets with a net book value of $86.2 million, based on a federal tax rate of 35%. If the federal statutory corporate income tax rate is reduced to 20%, this asset will be revalued at the lower rate, resulting in a charge to income tax expense and a corresponding reduction in deferred tax assets. 
 A change in ownership, as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382, could reduce the availability of NOLs for federal and state income tax purposes. Should Tontine sell or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of its position in IES, a change in ownership could occur. In addition, a change in ownership could result from the purchase of common stock by an existing or a new 5% shareholder as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Should a change in ownership occur, all net operating losses incurred prior to the change in ownership would be subject to limitation imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which would substantially reduce the amount of NOL currently available to offset taxable income. For more information see Note 3, Controlling Shareholder in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
5 


 The Company maintains a tax benefit protection plan (the NOL Rights Plan) which was designed to deter an acquisition of the Companys stock in excess of a threshold amount that could trigger a change of control within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 382. 
 OPERATING SEGMENTS 
 The Companys reportable segments consist of the consolidated business segments identified above, which offer different services and are managed separately. The table below describes the percentage of our total revenues attributable to each of our four segments over each of the last three years:

 For additional financial information by segment, see Note 10, Operating Segments in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Commercial & Industrial 
 Business Description 
 Our Commercial & Industrial segment provides electrical and mechanical design, service, and construction services to commercial and industrial markets. Our design services range from budget assistance to providing design-build and LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) solutions to our end customers. Our maintenance and emergency services include critical plant shutdown, troubleshooting, emergency testing, preventative maintenance, and constant presence. Our construction services range from the initial planning and procurement to installation and start-up and are offered to a variety of new and remodel construction projects, ranging from the construction of office buildings and industrial facilities to transmission and distribution projects. We also provide mechanical services such as maintenance agreements, installation, or replacement of mechanical equipment for commercial and industrial facilities. 
 During fiscal 2016, we expanded our geographic and service offerings with the acquisition of Shanahan Mechanical and Electrical, Inc. (Shanahan) and added mechanical service offerings with the acquisition of STR Mechanical, LLC (STR Mechanical). During fiscal 2017, we continued this expansion with the June 2017 acquisition of Technical Services and the July 2017 acquisition of NEXT Electric. 
 This segment provides services for a variety of project types, including office buildings, manufacturing facilities, data centers, chemical plants, refineries, wind farms, solar facilities, municipal infrastructure and health care facilities. The Commercial & Industrial segment consists of 24 locations, which includes the segment headquarters in Houston, Texas. These locations geographically cover Texas, Nebraska, Colorado, Oregon, Wisconsin, and the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. 
 Industry Overview 
 Given the diverse end-markets of our Commercial & Industrial customers, which include both commercial buildings, such as offices, healthcare facilities and schools, and industrial projects, such as power, chemical, 
 
6 


  refinery and heavy manufacturing facilities, we are subject to many trends within the construction industry. In general, demand for our Commercial & Industrial services is driven by construction and renovation activity levels, economic growth, and availability of bank lending. Due to economic, technological or other factors, there can be no assurance that construction and demand will increase. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales focus varies by location, but is primarily based upon regional and local relationships and a demonstrated expertise in certain areas, such as heavy industrial, design-build, agricultural, or transmission and distribution. Our maintenance and certain renovation and upgrade work tend to be either recurring or experience lower sensitivity to economic cycles, or both. A significant portion of our larger projects are awarded from long-term, repeat customers. From time to time, we are contracted on projects with completion times extending beyond one year or over several years, which are generally more complex and difficult to estimate. 
 With a focus on quality service offerings, our long-term strategy is to continue to be one of the preferred providers of electrical and mechanical services in the markets where we have demonstrated expertise and/or are a local market leader. Key elements of our long-term strategy include leveraging our expertise in certain niche markets, expanding our service and maintenance business, attracting and retaining highly qualified employees, and maintaining our focus on returns on risk adjusted capital. 
 Competition 
 The electrical and mechanical contracting services industry is generally highly competitive and includes a number of regional or small privately-held local firms. There are few barriers to entry for our electrical and mechanical contracting services in the commercial and industrial markets, which limits our advantages when competing for projects. Industry expertise, project size, location and past performance will determine our bidding strategy, the level of involvement from competitors and our level of success in winning awards. Our primary advantages vary by location and market, but mostly are based upon local individual relationships with key customers or a demonstrated industry expertise. Additionally, due to the size of many of our projects, our financial resources help us compete effectively against local competitors. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 
 The effects of seasonality on our Commercial & Industrial business are insignificant, as work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather. Most of our service and maintenance business is also generally not affected by seasonality. However, the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in construction projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period. 
Communications 
 Business Description 
 Originally established in 1984, our Communications segment is a leading provider of network infrastructure solutions for data centers and other mission critical environments. Our services include the design, installation and maintenance of network infrastructure to leading and recognizable global technology, social networking and e-commerce brands, including many Fortune 100 and 500 corporations. We serve a variety of industries and end-markets, including data centers for colocation and managed hosting customers; corporate, educational, financial, government, hospitality and healthcare buildings, e-commerce distribution centers; and high-tech manufacturing facilities. We also provide the design and installation of audio/visual, telephone, fire, wireless 
 
7 


  access and intrusion alarm systems, as well as design/build, service and maintenance of data network systems. We perform services across the United States from our 12 offices, including our Communications headquarters located in Tempe, Arizona, allowing dedicated onsite teams at our customers sites. 
 Industry Overview 
 Our Communications segment is driven by demand increases for computing and storage resources as a result of technology advancements and obsolescence and changes in data consumption patterns. The data center market remains strong, and we are continuing to expand our offerings in this market to broaden our customer base. Additionally, demand has been growing for our audio-visual and other building technology offerings. Nevertheless, due to economic, technological and other factors, there can be no assurance that demand will continue to increase. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales strategy relies on a concentrated business development effort, with centralized marketing programs and direct end-customer communications and relationships. Due to the mission critical nature of the facilities we service, our end-customers significantly rely upon our past performance record, technical expertise and specialized knowledge. A significant portion of our Communications business volume is generated from long-term, repeat customers, some of whom use IES as a preferred provider for major projects. 
 Our long-term strategy is to improve our position as a preferred mission critical solutions and services provider to large national corporations and strategic local companies. Key elements of our long-term strategy include continued investment in our employees technical expertise and expansion of our onsite maintenance and recurring revenue model, as well as opportunistic acquisitions of businesses that serve our markets, consistent with our stated corporate strategy. 
 Competition 
 Our competition consists of both large national or regional competitors and small, privately owned contractors who have limited access to capital. We compete on quality of service and/or price and seek to emphasize our long history of delivering high quality solutions to our customers. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 
 The effects of seasonality on our Communications business are insignificant, as work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather. Our service and maintenance business is also generally not affected by seasonality. However, communications infrastructure spending has historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period. 
Infrastructure Solutions 
 Business Description 
 Our Infrastructure Solutions segment provides electro-mechanical solutions for industrial operations to domestic and international customers. Our solutions include the maintenance and repair of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) electric motors and generators, as well as power generating and distribution equipment; the manufacture of custom-engineered, metal enclosed bus duct solutions used in power distribution; the manufacture of customer commercial and industrial generator enclosures; the manufacture, remanufacture, and repair of industrial lifting magnets; and maintenance and repair of railroad main and auxiliary generators, main alternators, and traction motors. 
 
8 


 This segment serves the steel, railroad, marine, petrochemical, pulp and paper, wind energy, mining, automotive, power generation, scrap yards, data center, and utility industries. Our Infrastructure Solutions segment is comprised of 10 locations and is headquartered in Ohio. These segment locations geographically cover Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and California. 
 We have enhanced our geographic and service offering through multiple acquisitions since 2015. We added to our service capabilities through the May 2015 acquisition of Southern Industrial Sales and Services, Inc. (Southern Rewinding), a Georgia-based provider of motor repair and field services, and the October 2015 acquisition of Calumet Armature & Electric, LLC (Calumet), an Illinois-based provider of design, manufacturing, assembly, and repair services of electric motors for the industrial and mass transit markets. Additionally, we have strengthened our offering of electro-mechanical products and services through the June 2016 acquisition of Technibus, Inc. (Technibus), a manufacturer of custom-engineered, metal enclosed bus duct solutions, which are highly engineered electrical components that conduct electricity between medium-voltage generators, breakers, transformers, and switchgear, primarily utilized at power generation plants and large electricity-consuming facilities, and the March 2017 acquisition of Freeman, a manufacturer of custom generator enclosures that are primarily used by data centers and large commercial and industrial facilities. 
 Industry Overview 
 Given the diverse end-markets of Infrastructure Solutions customers, we are subject to many economic trends. In general, demand for our services has been driven by in-house maintenance departments continuing to outsource maintenance and repair work, output levels and equipment utilization at heavy industrial facilities, railroad companies and mass transit authorities capital investments and repair needs, investment in the United States aging energy and industrial infrastructure, growth in industries, such as data centers and hospitals, that have high power demands and require dependable power supplies, and the overall health of the economy. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Demand for Infrastructure Solutions services is largely driven by the degree to which industrial and mechanical services are outsourced by our customers, production rates at steel mills, investments in power generation, other heavy industrial facilities, data centers, and the need for electrical infrastructure improvements. Our sales efforts are primarily driven by personnel based at our operating locations, as well as independent sales representatives. Given that the majority of our apparatus repair customers are located within a 200-mile radius of our facilities, we believe that this structure allows us to rapidly address and respond to the needs of our customers. Our custom-engineered bus system and generator enclosure products and services are principally sold in partnership with an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or to an engineering, procurement and construction firm on behalf of the end-user. Our long term strategy is to be the preferred solutions provider of outsourced electro-mechanical services, repairs, and manufacturing to our select markets and a leader in custom-engineered metal enclosed bus systems. 
Competition 
 Our competition is comprised mainly of small, specialized manufacturing and repair shops, a limited number of other multi-location providers of electric motor repair, engineering and maintenance services, and various OEMs. Participants in this industry compete primarily on the basis of capabilities, service, quality, timeliness and price. We believe that we have a competitive advantage due to our breadth of capabilities, focus on quality, technical support and customer service. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 
 Infrastructure Solutions revenues from industrial services may be affected by the timing of scheduled outages at its industrial customers facilities and by weather conditions with respect to projects conducted outdoors, but the 
 
9 


  effects of seasonality on revenues in its industrial services business are insignificant. Infrastructure Solutions quarterly results may fluctuate, and the results of one fiscal quarter may not be representative of the results of any other quarter or of the full fiscal year. 
 Residential 
 Business Description 
 Originally established in 1973, our Residential segment is a leading provider of electrical installation services for single-family housing and multi-family apartment complexes and cable television installations for residential and light commercial applications. In addition to our core electrical construction work, the Residential segment also provides services for the installation of residential solar power, both for new construction and existing residences. The Residential segment is made up of 36 total locations, which include the segment headquarters in Houston, Texas. These locations geographically cover the Sun-Belt, Western and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. 
 Industry Overview 
 Our Residential business is closely correlated to the single and multi-family housing market. Although demand for both single-family and multi-family housing has increased in recent years, we expect to see a decrease in multi-family housing construction in fiscal 2018. Due to economic, technological or other factors, there can be no assurance that overall construction and demand will continue to increase in the future. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Demand for our Residential services is highly dependent on the number of single-family and multi-family home starts in the markets we serve. Although we operate in multiple states throughout the Sun-Belt, Mid-Atlantic and Western regions of the United States, the majority of our segment revenues are derived from services provided in Texas. Our sales efforts include a variety of strategies, including a concentrated focus on national and regional homebuilders and multi-family developers and a local sales strategy for single and multi-family housing projects. Our cable and solar revenues are typically generated through third parties specializing in these industries who select us as a preferred provider of installation services. A significant portion of our Residential business volume is generated from long-term, repeat customers, some of whom use IES as a preferred provider for major projects. 
 Our long-term strategy is to continue to be a leading provider of electrical services to the residential market. The key elements of our long-term strategy include a continued focus on maintaining a low and variable cost structure and cash generation, allowing us to effectively scale according to the housing cycle. During the housing downturn, we modified our strategy by expanding into markets less exposed to national building cycles, such as solar panel and cable installation services. 
 Competition 
 Our competition primarily consists of small, privately owned contractors who have limited access to capital. We believe that we have a competitive advantage over these smaller competitors due to our key employees long-standing customer relationships, our financial capabilities, and our local market knowledge and competitive pricing. There are few barriers to entry for electrical contracting services in the residential markets. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 
 Results of operations from our Residential segment can be seasonal, depending on weather trends, with typically higher revenues generated during spring and summer and lower revenues during fall and winter. Our service and maintenance business is generally not affected by seasonality. In addition, the construction industry has 
 
10 


  historically been highly cyclical. Our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in construction projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions. Quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects. Accordingly, operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period. 
 SOURCES OF SUPPLY 
 The raw materials and components we use within our segments include, but are not limited to, electrical fixtures and system components, copper, aluminum, and raw steel. These raw materials and components are generally available from a variety of domestic suppliers at competitive prices. Delivery times are typically short for most raw materials and standard components, but during periods of peak demand, may extend to one month or more. Our strategy to reduce commodity cost exposure includes early buying of commodities for particular projects or general inventory, as well as including escalation and escape provisions in project bids, quotes and contracts wherever possible. 
RISK MANAGEMENT 
 The primary risks in our existing operations include project bidding and management, bodily injury, property and environmental damage, and construction defects. We monitor project bidding and management practices at various levels within the Company. We maintain automobile, general liability and construction defect insurance for third party health, bodily injury and property damage, as well as pollution coverage and workers compensation coverage, which we consider appropriate to insure against these risks. Our third-party insurance is subject to deductibles for which we establish reserves. In light of these risks, we are also committed to a strong safety and environmental compliance culture. We employ full-time and part-time regional safety managers, under the supervision of our full-time Senior Vice President of Safety, and seek to maintain standardized safety and environmental policies, programs, procedures and personal protection equipment relative to each segment, including programs to train new employees, which apply to employees new to the industry and those new to the Company. 
 In the electrical contracting industry, our ability to post surety bonds provides us with an advantage over competitors that are smaller or have fewer financial resources. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet, as well as a good relationship with our bonding providers, enhances our ability to obtain adequate financing and surety bonds, although there can be no assurance that surety bonding coverage will be available when we need it. For a further discussion of our risks, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.CUSTOMERS 
 We have a diverse customer base. During the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. We emphasize developing and maintaining relationships with our customers by providing superior, high-quality service. Management at each of our segments is responsible for determining sales strategies and sales activities. 
 BACKLOG 
 Backlog is a measure of revenue that we expect to recognize from work that has yet to be performed on uncompleted contracts and from work that has been contracted but has not started, exclusive of short-term projects. Not all of our work is performed under contracts included in backlog; for example, most of the 
 
11 


  apparatus repair work that is completed by our Infrastructure Solutions segment is performed under master service agreements on an as-needed basis. Additionally, electrical installation services for single-family housing in our Residential segment is completed on a short-term basis and is therefore excluded from backlog. The table below summarizes our backlog by segment: 
 

 | Years Ended September 30, | 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
 | (Dollars in millions) | 
Commercial & Industrial | $ | 140 | | $ | 116
Communications | | 69 | | | 91 
Infrastructure Solutions | | 39 | | | 34 
Residential | | 83 | | | 100
Total | $ | 331 | | $ | 341

 While our entire backlog is supported by documentation from customers authorizing the performance of future work, backlog is not a guarantee of future revenues as contractual commitments may change. We expect that $278 million of our September 30, 2017, backlog will result in revenue during fiscal 2018, with the remaining $53 million expected to be realized in fiscal 2019; however, there can be no assurance that this backlog will be completed within expected time frames or at all. The decline in our backlog year over year is driven by our Communications and Residential segments. Backlog in our Communications segment can be highly variable, as this segments backlog is characterized by large, relatively quick-turning projects. The timing of our customers investment cycles may result in periods of lower growth. Our Residential segments backlog was atypically high at September 30, 2016, as a result of project delays related to labor shortages in other trades. We worked through that delay related backlog during fiscal 2017. 
 REGULATIONS 
 Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including: 
 

 | licensing requirements applicable to electricians and service technicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | building and electrical codes;
--+-------------------------------


 | regulations relating to worker safety, labor relations and protection of the environment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regulations relating to consumer protection, including those governing residential service agreements; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | qualifications of our business legal structure in the jurisdictions where we do business.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many state and local regulations governing electricians require permits and licenses to be held by individuals. In some cases, a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all our electricians who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license. We endeavour to ensure that, where possible, any permits or licenses that may be material to our operations in a particular geographic area are held by multiple employees within that area. 
 We believe we have all licenses required to conduct our operations and are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses or an inability to perform government work. 
 CAPITAL FACILITIES 
 During fiscal year 2017, the Company maintained a revolving credit facility, as described in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The Revolving

12 


  Credit Facility of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of the Companys capital resources, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 For information on the Companys financial information by segment, see Note 10, Operating Segments in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 At September 30, 2017, we had 3,532 employees. We are party to two collective bargaining agreements within our Infrastructure Solutions segment. We have not experienced, and do not expect, any work stoppage, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is strong. 
LOCATIONS 
 As of September 30, 2017, we have 84 domestic locations serving the United States. In addition to our 2 executive and corporate offices, as of September 30, 2017, we have 24 locations within our Commercial & Industrial business, 12 locations within our Communications business, 10 locations within our Infrastructure Solutions business and 36 locations within our Residential business. This diversity helps to reduce our exposure to unfavorable economic developments in any given region.

 General information about us can be found on our website at www.ies-co.com under Investor Relations. We file our interim and annual financial reports, as well as other reports required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), with the SEC. 
 Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments and exhibits to those reports are available free of charge through our website as soon as it is reasonably practicable after we file them with, or furnish them to, the SEC. You may also contact our Investor Relations department and they will provide you with a copy of these reports. The materials that we file with the SEC are also available free of charge through the SECs website at www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy these materials at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE., Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room is available by calling the SEC at 1800SEC0330. 
 In addition to the Code of Ethics for Financial Executives, we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for directors, officers and employees (the Legal Compliance and Corporate Policy Manual), and established Corporate Governance Guidelines and adopted charters outlining the duties of our Audit, Human Resources and Compensation and Nominating/Governance Committees, copies of which may be found on our website. Paper copies of these documents are also available free of charge upon written request to us. We have designated an audit committee financial expert as that term is defined by the SEC. Further information about this designee may be found in the Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company.
