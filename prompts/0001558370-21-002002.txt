ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General.
United States Lime & Minerals, Inc. (the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “We” or “Our”), which was incorporated in 1950, conducts its business primarily through its Lime and Limestone Operations segment. During 2019, our natural gas interests did not reach any of the quantitative thresholds for a reportable segment, and we do not expect the results from our natural gas interests to be of significance in future periods. The revenues, gross profit and operating profit from our natural gas interests are included in Other for our reportable segment disclosures. Disclosures for 2018 have been recast to be consistent with the 2019 and 2020 presentation.
The Company’s principal corporate office is located at 5429 LBJ Freeway, Suite 230, Dallas, Texas 75240. The Company’s telephone number is (972) 991-8400 and its internet address is www.uslm.com. The Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on the Company’s website as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
On July 1, 2020, the Company acquired ART Quarry TRS LLC (DBA Carthage Crushed Limestone) (“Carthage”), a limestone mining and production company located in Carthage, Missouri, for $8.4 million cash, subject to adjustment for working capital balances acquired. Carthage provides aggregate and pulverized limestone products that are used primarily in the agricultural, construction, roofing and industrial industries.
Lime and Limestone Operations.
Business and Products. The Company, through its Lime and Limestone Operations, is a manufacturer of lime and limestone products, supplying primarily the construction (including highway, road and building contractors), industrial (including paper and glass manufacturers), metals (including steel producers), environmental (including municipal sanitation and water treatment facilities and flue gas treatment processes), roof shingle manufacturers, agriculture (including poultry and cattle feed producers), and oil and gas services industries. The Company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and operates lime and limestone plants and distribution facilities in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Arkansas Lime Company, ART Quarry TRS LLC (DBA Carthage Crushed Limestone), Colorado Lime Company, Texas Lime Company, U.S. Lime Company, U.S. Lime Company—Shreveport, U.S. Lime Company—St. Clair and U.S. Lime Company—Transportation.
The Company extracts high-quality limestone from its open-pit quarries and an underground mine and then processes it for sale as pulverized limestone, aggregate, quicklime, hydrated lime and lime slurry. Pulverized limestone (also referred to as ground calcium carbonate) (“PLS”) is produced by applying heat to dry the limestone, which is then ground to granular and finer sizes. Quicklime (calcium oxide) is produced by heating limestone to very high temperatures in kilns in a process called calcination. Hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) is produced by reacting quicklime with water in a controlled process. Lime slurry (milk of lime) is a suspended solution of calcium hydroxide produced by mixing quicklime with water in a lime slaker.
PLS is used in the production of construction materials such as roof shingles and asphalt paving, as an additive to agriculture feeds, in the production of glass, as a soil enhancement, in flue gas treatment for utilities and other industries requiring scrubbing of emissions for environmental purposes and for mine safety dust in coal mining operations. Quicklime is used primarily in metal processing, in flue gas treatment, in soil stabilization for highway, road and building construction, as well as for oilfield roads and drill sites, in the manufacturing of paper products and in municipal sanitation and water treatment facilities. Hydrated lime is used primarily in municipal sanitation and water treatment facilities, in soil stabilization for highway, road and building construction, in flue gas treatment, in asphalt as an anti-stripping agent, as a conditioning agent for oil and gas drilling mud and in the production of chemicals. Lime slurry is used primarily in soil stabilization for highway, road and building construction.

Product Sales. In 2020, the Company sold almost all of its lime and limestone products in the states of Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Sales were made primarily by the Company’s ten sales employees who call on current and potential customers and solicit orders, which are generally made on a purchase-order basis. The Company also receives orders in response to bids that it prepares and submits to current and potential customers.
Principal customers for the Company’s lime and limestone products are construction customers (including highway, road and building contractors), industrial customers (including paper manufacturers and glass manufacturers), metals producers (including steel producers), environmental customers (including municipal sanitation and water treatment facilities and flue gas treatment processes), roof shingle manufacturers, poultry and cattle feed producers, and oil and gas services companies. 
Approximately 630 customers accounted for the Company’s sales of lime and limestone products during 2020. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of such sales. The Company is generally not subject to significant customer demand and credit risks as its customers are considerably diversified within our geographic region and by industry concentration. However, given the nature of the lime and limestone industry, the Company’s profits are very sensitive to changes in sales volume and prices.
Lime and limestone products are transported by truck and rail to customers generally within a radius of 400 miles of each of the Company’s plants. All of the Company’s 2020 sales were made within the United States.
Seasonality. The Company’s sales have typically reflected seasonal trends, with the largest percentage of total annual shipments and revenues normally being realized in the second and third quarters. Lower seasonal demand normally results in reduced shipments and revenues in the first and fourth quarters. Inclement weather conditions generally have a negative impact on the demand for lime and limestone products supplied to construction-related customers, as well as on the Company’s open-pit quarrying operations.
Limestone Reserves. The Company’s limestone reserves contain at least 96% calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The Company has two subsidiaries that extract limestone from open-pit quarries: Texas Lime Company (“Texas Lime”), which is located near Cleburne, Texas, and Arkansas Lime Company (“Arkansas Lime”), which is located near Batesville, Arkansas. U.S. Lime Company—St. Clair (“St. Clair”) extracts limestone from an underground mine located near Marble City, Oklahoma. Carthage extracts limestone from an underground mine located in Carthage, Missouri. Colorado Lime Company (“Colorado Lime”) owns property containing limestone deposits at Monarch Pass, Colorado. Existing crushed stone stockpiles on the property are being used to provide feedstock to the Company’s plant in Delta, Colorado. Access to all properties is provided by paved roads and, in the case of Arkansas Lime, St. Clair, and Carthage, also by rail.
Texas Lime operates a quarry and has lime, hydrated lime and limestone production facilities, located on approximately 4,100 acres of land that contains known high-quality limestone reserves in a bed averaging 28 feet in thickness, with an overburden that ranges from 0 to 50 feet. Texas Lime also has mineral interests in approximately 330 acres of land adjacent to the northwest boundary of its property. The Texas Lime reserves, as of December 31, 2020, were approximately 27 million tons of proven recoverable reserves plus approximately 78 million tons of probable recoverable reserves. Assuming the current level of production and recovery rate is maintained, the Company estimates that these reserves are sufficient to sustain operations for more than 70 years.
Arkansas Lime operates two quarries and has lime, hydrated lime and limestone production facilities on a second site linked to the quarries by its own railroad. The quarries cover approximately 1,050 acres of land located in Independence County, Arkansas containing a known deposit of high-quality limestone reserves (the “Batesville Quarry”). The average thickness of the high-quality limestone bed is approximately 60 feet, with an average overburden thickness of approximately 30 feet. The reserves for the Batesville Quarry, as of December 31, 2020, were approximately 7 million tons of proven recoverable reserves. In 2005, the Company acquired approximately 2,500 acres of land in nearby Izard County, Arkansas (the “Love Hollow Quarry”). The high-quality reserves on these 2,500 acres, as of December 31, 2020, were approximately 76 million tons of probable recoverable reserves. The Company is improving the transportation infrastructure between the Love Hollow Quarry and Arkansas Lime’s production facilities and incurring other development costs to prepare the Love Hollow Quarry for mining. Assuming the current level of 

2



production and recovery rate is maintained, the Company estimates that its total reserves in Arkansas are sufficient to sustain operations for more than 60 years.
St. Clair operates an underground mine and has lime, hydrated lime and limestone production facilities located on approximately 1,400 acres that it owns containing high-quality limestone reserves. The reserves, as of December 31, 2020, were approximately 12 million tons of probable recoverable reserves on 410 acres. Assuming the current level of production and recovery rate is maintained, the Company estimates that the probable recoverable reserves are sufficient to sustain operations for approximately 25 years. In addition, St. Clair also has the right to mine the high-quality limestone contained in approximately 1,330 adjacent acres pursuant to long-term mineral leases. The Company has not conducted a drilling program to identify and categorize reserves on the 1,330 leased acres.
Carthage operates an underground mine and has limestone production facilities located on approximately 800 acres that it owns containing high-quality limestone reserves. In addition, Carthage has the right to mine the high-quality limestone contained in approximately 160 adjacent acres pursuant to long-term mineral leases. The owned and leased reserves, as of December 31, 2020, were approximately 14 million tons of probable recoverable reserves. Assuming the current level of production and recovery rate is maintained, the Company estimates that the probable recoverable reserves are sufficient to sustain operations for approximately 20 years. Additionally, the Company has an option to acquire the right to mine under long-term mineral leases on approximately 600 acres of adjacent land. The Company is drilling and assessing the quality of the reserves on the properties with options to lease.
During 2020, the Company produced approximately 3 million tons of limestone from its quarries and mines.
Colorado Lime acquired the Monarch Pass Quarry in November 1995 and has not carried out any mining on the property. A review of the potential limestone resources has been completed by independent geologists; however, the Company has not initiated a drilling program. Consequently, it is not possible to identify and categorize reserves. The Monarch Pass Quarry, which had been operated for many years until the early 1990s, contains a mixture of limestone types, including high-quality calcium limestone and dolomite. Assuming the current level of production is maintained, the Company estimates that the remaining crushed stone stockpiles on the property are sufficient to supply its Delta, Colorado plant for approximately 15 years.
Quarrying and Mining. The Company extracts limestone by the open-pit method at its Texas and Batesville quarries. The Monarch Pass Quarry is also an open-pit quarry but is not being mined at this time. The open-pit method consists of removing any overburden comprising soil and other substances, including inferior limestone, and then extracting the exposed high-quality limestone. The Company removes such overburden by utilizing both its own employees and equipment and those of outside contractors. Open-pit mining is generally less expensive than underground mining. The principal disadvantage of the open-pit method is that operations are subject to inclement weather and overburden removal. The limestone is extracted by drilling and blasting, utilizing standard mining equipment. At its St. Clair and Carthage underground mines, the Company mines limestone using room and pillar mining. We have no knowledge of any recent changes in the physical quarrying or mining conditions on any of our properties that have materially affected quarrying or mining operations.
Plants and Facilities. After extraction, limestone is crushed and screened and, in the case of PLS, ground and dried, or, in the case of quicklime, processed in kilns. Quicklime may then be further processed in hydrators and slakers to produce hydrated lime and lime slurry. The Company processes and distributes lime and/or limestone products at four plants, six lime slurry facilities and three terminal facilities. All of its plants and facilities are accessible by paved roads, and, in the case of the Arkansas Lime, St. Clair and Carthage plants and the terminal facilities, also by rail.
The Texas Lime plant has an annual capacity of approximately 470 thousand tons of quicklime from two preheater rotary kilns. The plant also has PLS equipment, which, depending on the product mix, has the capacity to produce approximately 800 thousand tons of PLS annually.
The Arkansas plant is situated at the Batesville Quarry. Utilizing three preheater rotary kilns, this plant has an annual capacity of approximately 630 thousand tons of quicklime. Arkansas Lime’s PLS and hydrating facilities are situated on a tract of 290 acres located approximately two miles from the Quarry, to which it is connected by a 

3



Company-owned railroad. The PLS equipment, depending on the product mix, has the capacity to produce approximately 300 thousand tons of PLS annually.
The St. Clair plant has an annual capacity of approximately 250 thousand tons of quicklime from one preheater rotary kiln and one vertical kiln. The plant also has PLS equipment, which has the capacity to produce approximately 150 thousand tons of PLS annually. 
The Carthage plant has facilities located next to the mine that produce both aggregates and PLS. The equipment has the capacity to produce approximately 900 thousand tons annually.
The Company also maintains lime hydrating and bagging equipment at the Texas, Arkansas and St. Clair plants. Storage facilities for lime and limestone products at each plant consist primarily of cylindrical tanks, which are considered by the Company to be adequate to protect its lime and limestone products and to provide an available supply for customers’ needs at the expected volumes of shipments. Equipment is maintained at each plant to load trucks and, at the Arkansas Lime and St. Clair plants, to load railroad cars.
Colorado Lime operates a limestone grinding and bagging facility with an annual capacity of approximately 125 thousand tons, located on approximately three and one-half acres of land in Delta, Colorado.
During 2020, the Company’s utilization rate was approximately 57% of its aggregate annual production capacity for the plants in its Lime and Limestone Operations.
U.S. Lime Company (“US Lime”) uses quicklime to produce lime slurry and has four Houston area facilities, including two distribution terminals connected to railroads, to serve the Greater Houston area construction market and four facilities to serve the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex. The Company established U.S. Lime Company—Transportation (“Transportation”) to deliver some of the Company’s products to its customers and facilities primarily in the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex. 
U.S. Lime Company — Shreveport operates a distribution terminal in Shreveport, Louisiana, which is connected to a railroad, to provide lime storage, hydrating, slurrying and distribution capacity to service markets in Louisiana and East Texas.
The Company believes that its plants and facilities are adequately maintained and insured.
Human Capital Resources. The Company is committed to attracting and retaining the best and brightest talent to meet the current and future needs of its business. Attracting, retaining, motivating, and investing in the development of human capital resources is a critical part of the Company’s commitment to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) and sustainability issues.
At December 31, 2020, the Company employed 317 persons, 110 of whom were represented by unions. The Company is a party to three collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreement for the Texas facilities expires in November 2023. The collective bargaining agreement for the Arkansas facilities expires in January 2023. The collective bargaining agreement for the Carthage facilities expires in May 2022. Overall, the Company believes that its employee relations are generally good.
Employee Retention and Incentivization. The Company has entered into an employment agreement with Timothy W. Byrne, its President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Byrne’s employment agreement became effective as of January 1, 2020 for a five-year term and will continue for successive one-year periods unless the Company or Mr. Byrne gives at least one-year’s prior written notice of intent not to renew. Under the employment agreement, in addition to the possibility of a discretionary cash bonus, Mr. Byrne is entitled each year to an EBITDA cash bonus opportunity under the United States Lime & Minerals, Inc. Amended and Restated 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), and he is also entitled to grants of equity awards under the Plan.
Mr. Byrne’s employment agreement provides that Mr. Byrne is subject to certain forfeiture/clawback and share ownership provisions designed to align Mr. Byrne’s financial interests with those of the Company’s long-term shareholders, and to ensure that he is incentivized not to take actions that may benefit the Company and its shareholders 

4



in the short-term at the expense of long-term corporate value creation and sustainability. In particular, in entering into the employment agreement with Mr. Byrne, the Company’s Board of Directors and Compensation Committee were sensitive to how Mr. Byrne’s leadership and actions could further the Company’s various objectives, including human capital resources development and executive succession planning.
With respect to the Company’s broader employee base, certain employees are eligible to receive annual cash bonuses based on discretionary determinations. Except in the case of Mr. Byrne, the Company has not adopted a formal or informal annual bonus arrangement with pre-set performance goals. Rather, the determination to pay a cash bonus, if any, is made in December each year based on the past performance of the individual and the Company or on the attainment of non-quantified performance goals during the year. In either such case, the discretionary bonus may be based on the specific accomplishments of the individual and/or on the overall performance of the Company. The amounts of the discretionary bonuses for 2020 were based on each employee’s individual performance and accomplishments, as well as those of the Company, including productivity, sales, and contributions made to special projects.
In addition to cash bonuses, the Company makes equity awards to certain individuals under the Plan. The Company uses equity awards granted under the Plan as a means to attract, retain, and motivate the Company’s directors, officers, employees, and consultants. The Company views the use of equity awards under the Plan as an important means of aligning the interests of its employees with those of its shareholders.
Employee Health and Safety. The Company believes that it is responsible to its employees to provide a safe and healthy workplace environment. The Company seeks to accomplish this by: training employees in safe work practices; openly communicating with employees; following safety standards and establishing and improving safe work practices; involving employees in safety processes; and recording, reporting and investigating accidents, incidents and losses to avoid reoccurrence.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is continuing to focus on the health and safety of its employees and other individuals at its facilities that produce lime and limestone products to the essential businesses and communities that it serves. In addition to its standard health and safety protocols, the Company has implemented enhanced protocols at all of its locations. These protocols include reduced access to facilities, screening of individuals on all sites, and the enforcement of social distancing and other practices that are consistent with, or exceed, the guidelines of the Center for Disease Control and state and local authorities.
Employee Development and Training. The Company encourages and supports the growth and development of its employees. It advances continual learning and career development through ongoing performance and development conversations or evaluations with employees and internally and externally developed training programs. The Company also provides reimbursement for certain educational programs relating to the Company’s business.
Employee Diversity and Inclusion. The Company is committed to fostering a work environment that values and promotes diversity and inclusion. This commitment includes providing equal access to, and participation in, equal employment opportunities, programs, and services, without regard to a person’s gender, nationality, race, and ethnicity. The Company is focused on the development and fair treatment of its employees, including equal employment hiring practices and policies, anti-harassment, and anti-retaliation policies. The Company is continuing to invest in and take actions in an effort to create a more diverse and inclusive workforce and workplace environment.
Competition. The lime industry is highly regionalized and competitive, with price, quality, ability to meet customer demands and specifications, proximity to customers, personal relationships and timeliness of deliveries being the prime competitive factors. The Company’s competitors are predominantly private companies.
The lime industry is characterized by high barriers to entry, including: the scarcity of high-quality limestone deposits on which the required zoning and permitting for extraction can be obtained; the need for lime plants and facilities to be located close to markets, paved roads and railroad networks to enable cost-effective production and distribution; clean air and anti-pollution regulations, including those related to greenhouse gas emissions, which make it more difficult to obtain permitting for new sources of emissions, such as lime kilns; and the high capital cost of the 

5



plants and facilities. These considerations reinforce the premium value of operations having permitted, long-term, high-quality limestone reserves and good locations and transportation relative to markets.
Lime producers tend to be concentrated on known high-quality limestone formations where competition takes place principally on a regional basis. While the steel industry and environmental-related users, including utility plants, are the largest market sectors, the lime industry also counts chemical users and other industrial users, including paper manufacturers, oil and gas services and highway, road and building contractors, among its major customers. 
In recent years, the lime industry has experienced reduced demand from certain industries as they experience cyclical or secular downturns. For example, demand from the Company’s steel and oil and gas services customers tends to vary with the demand for their products and services, which has continued to be cyclical. In addition, utility plants are continuing to use more natural gas and renewable sources for power generation instead of coal, which reduces their demand for lime and limestone for flue gas treatment processes. These reductions in demand have resulted in increased competitive pressures, including pricing and competition for certain customer accounts, in the industry. 
Consolidation in the lime industry has left the three largest companies accounting for more than two-thirds of North American production capacity. In addition to the consolidations, and often in conjunction with them, many lime producers have undergone modernization and expansion and development projects to upgrade their processing equipment in an effort to improve operating efficiency. We believe that our modernization and expansion projects in Texas and Arkansas, the kiln project at our St. Clair operations in Oklahoma, and the July 2020 Carthage acquisition, along with our lime slurry operations in Texas, should allow us to continue to remain competitive, protect our markets and position ourselves for the future. In addition, we will continue to evaluate internal and external opportunities for expansion, growth and increased profitability, as conditions warrant, or opportunities arise. We may have to revise our strategy or otherwise consider ways to enhance the value of the Company, including by entering into strategic partnerships, mergers or other transactions.
Compliance with Government Regulations. The Company is subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations that may materially impact the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position. These include laws and regulations relating to the environment, mine permitting and operations, mine safety, and reclamation and remediation. 
​
Environmental Laws. The Company owns or controls large areas of land on which it operates limestone quarries, two underground mines, lime plants and other facilities with inherent environmental responsibilities, compliance costs and liabilities. These include maintenance and operating costs for pollution control equipment, the cost of ongoing monitoring and reporting programs, the cost of reclamation efforts and other similar environmental costs and liabilities. 
​
The Company’s operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and other regulatory matters, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and analogous state and local laws (“Environmental Laws”). These Environmental Laws grant the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and state governmental agencies the authority to promulgate and enforce regulations that could result in substantial expenditures on pollution control, waste management, permitting compliance activities, and mining reclamation. Many Environmental Laws also authorize private citizens and interest groups to file lawsuits in court to enforce alleged violations. Changes in policy or political leadership may affect how Environmental Laws are interpreted or enforced by the EPA and state governmental agencies. The failure to comply with Environmental Laws may result in administrative and civil penalties, injunctive relief and criminal prosecution. The Company has not been named as a potentially responsible party in any federal superfund cleanup site or state-led cleanup site. 
​
The rate of change of Environmental Laws continues to be rapid, and compliance can require significant expenditures. For example, the Clean Air Act required the Company’s lime plants to obtain Title V operating permits that have significant ongoing compliance costs. In addition to the Title V permits, other environmental operating permits are required for the Company’s operations, and such permits are subject to modification during the permit renewal process and, in rare instances, could be revoked. Over time, the EPA has increased the stringency of the National 

6



Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”), which are used to establish permitting limits under the Clean Air Act. 
The EPA has lowered ozone standards and reclassified areas where State Implementation Plans (the “SIPs”) exist. In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the ground-level ozone NAAQS to 70 parts per billion. In December 2018, the EPA issued a final rule affecting SIP requirements for attainment demonstrations, planning and implementation deadlines for reasonably available control technology, emissions inventories and emissions standards, and the timing of required SIP revisions. State environmental agencies in the states in which we operate are currently in the process of revising their SIPs to comply. For example, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality adopted a rule package in June 2020 to incorporate the 2015 ozone NAAQS into the emission inventory provisions of the Texas SIP. This and similar rulemakings could increase the cost of future plant modifications or expansions, increase compliance costs and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position. 
EPA regulations require large emitters of greenhouse gases, including the Company’s plants, to collect and report greenhouse gas emissions data. The EPA has previously indicated that it will use the data collected through the greenhouse gas reporting rules to decide whether to promulgate future greenhouse gas emission limits. The EPA and delegated states also regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the New Source Review permitting and Federal Operating Permit programs for facilities that are otherwise subject to permitting based on their emissions of conventional, non-greenhouse gas pollutants. Thus, any new facilities or major modifications to existing facilities that exceed the federal New Source Review emission thresholds for conventional pollutants may be required to use “best available control technology” and energy efficiency measures to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.
​
Although the timing and impact of climate change legislation and of regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions are uncertain, the consequences of such legislation and regulation are potentially significant for the Company because the production of CO2 is inherent in the manufacture of lime through the calcination of limestone and combustion of fossil fuels. In February 2021, the new Administration rejoined the Paris Agreement. The Agreement commits the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Future regulation related to the Paris Agreement or other greenhouse gas rulemakings could affect New Source Review permitting or other permitting programs and, thereby, increase the time and costs of plant upgrades and expansions. The passage of climate change legislation, and other regulatory initiatives by the Congress, the states or the EPA that restrict or tax emissions of greenhouse gases, could also adversely affect the Company. There is no assurance that changes in the law or regulations will not be adopted, such as the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limits, a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program requiring the Company to purchase carbon credits or other measures that would require reductions in emissions or changes to raw materials, fuel use or production rates. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position.
In addition to regulation, several court cases have been filed and decisions issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by third parties against companies for their greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air permits, to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or to recover damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people and property. 
In July 2020, the EPA adopted a final revision to a federal regulation that establishes national standards to meet the maximum achievable control technology (“MACT”) within the lime industry. Also known as the “Lime MACT,” this rulemaking is the second revision to the initial Lime MACT promulgated in 2004.  The revision included changes to the startup, shutdown and malfunction provisions contained in the prior Lime MACT rule, but otherwise did not impose more stringent standards. In September 2020, a non-governmental organization filed a petition for reconsideration asking the EPA to reconsider the Lime MACT and arguing the EPA’s decision to not set limits for hazardous air pollutants was unlawful. The non-governmental organization also initiated litigation in September 2020 before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to challenge the Lime MACT. It is uncertain how the petition for reconsideration, the litigation, or changes in policy and political leadership may affect the Lime MACT rulemaking.
​
There is no assurance that the final Lime MACT rule will not be withdrawn, revised or overturned by a judicial decision, or that a replacement regulation will not incorporate more stringent standards.  Changes in the Lime MACT rule could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position.

​
The Company also holds permits for process water and storm water discharges and must comply with the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. Any failure to comply with these permits could result in fines or other penalties. Material changes to the terms of these permits or changes to regulations affecting water discharges in the future could also increase compliance costs. 
​
The manufacturing of lime and hydrated lime requires significant volumes of water. The Company operates multiple groundwater wells to provide water to its plants. Groundwater pumping is subject to increased regulation, and in some areas the Company is required to obtain permits from groundwater conservation districts to pump groundwater. Any failure to comply with these permits could result in fines or other penalties and future changes that restrict the quantities of groundwater that may be pumped may increase compliance costs.
​
The Company incurred capital expenditures related to environmental matters of $0.7 million, $1.2 million, and $1.2 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company’s recurring costs associated with managing environmental permitting and waste recycling and disposal (e.g., used oil and lubricants) and maintaining pollution control equipment amounted to $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Mine Safety. The Company’s mining operations are also subject to regulation under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). The Mine Act has been construed as authorizing the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) to issue citations and orders pursuant to the legal doctrine of strict liability, or liability without fault. If, in the opinion of an MSHA inspector, a condition that violates the Mine Act or regulations promulgated pursuant to it exists, then a citation or order will be issued regardless of whether the operator had any knowledge of, or fault in, the existence of that condition. Many of the Mine Act standards include one or more subjective elements, so that issuance of a citation or order often depends on the opinions or experience of the MSHA inspector involved and the frequency and severity of citations and orders will vary from inspector to inspector.
Whenever MSHA believes that a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard, or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation or order which describes the violation and fixes a time within which the operator must abate the violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order requiring cessation of operations, or removal of miners from the area of the mine, affected by the condition until the hazards are corrected. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it has authority to propose a civil penalty or fine, as a result of the violation, that the operator is ordered to pay.
Citations and orders can be contested before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the “Commission”), and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The Commission is an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act. These cases may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and penalties they have received from MSHA, or complaints of discrimination by miners under section 105 of the Mine Act.
Reclamation and Remediation. The Company recognizes legal reclamation and remediation obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred (“Asset Retirement Obligations” or “AROs”). Some of the states the Company operates in have reclamation regulations to properly reclaim the surface mines. These regulations require permitting with the respective state to ensure reclamation obligations are met. Over time, the liability for AROs is recorded at its present value each period through accretion expense, and the capitalized cost is amortized over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, the Company either settles the ARO for its recorded amount or recognizes a gain or loss. AROs are estimated based on studies and the Company’s process knowledge and estimates and are discounted using an appropriate interest rate. The AROs are adjusted when further information warrants an adjustment. The Company believes its accrual of $1.5 million for AROs at December 31, 2020 is reasonable.

Other.
Our Other operations, consisting of our natural gas interests, are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary, U.S. Lime Company – O&G, LLC (“U.S. Lime – O&G”) and consist principally of a lease with respect to oil and gas rights on our Cleburne, Texas property, located in the Barnett Shale Formation. Pursuant to the lease, we have royalty interests ranging from 15.4% to 20% in oil and gas produced from any successful wells drilled on the leased property and an option to participate in any well drilled on the leased property as a 20% non-operated working interest owner.
