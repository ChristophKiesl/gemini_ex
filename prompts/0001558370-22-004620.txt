Item 1. Business. 
​
General Information
​
Partners Bancorp. Partners Bancorp (the “Company”) is a Maryland chartered corporation and a bank holding company registered with and supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Company holds all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of The Bank of Delmarva (“Delmarva”) and Virginia Partners Bank (“Partners” and, together with Delmarva, the “Affiliate Banks”). The Company was incorporated as Delmar Bancorp on January 6, 1988 under the general corporation law of Maryland for the purpose of becoming a bank holding company, and changed its name to Partners Bancorp effective on August 19, 2020. Partners is a commercial bank which was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and commenced regular operations on July 8, 2008. The Company acquired Partners on November 15, 2019 through an exchange of shares in an all-stock transaction (the “Share Exchange”) pursuant to which each share of Partners common stock was exchanged for 1.7179 shares of the Company’s common stock. Options and warrants to acquire Partners common stock were assumed by the Company and converted into options and warrants to acquire shares of Company common stock.
​
The Company has no direct subsidiaries other than Delmarva and Partners. The principal executive office of the Company is located at 2245 Northwood Drive, Salisbury, Maryland 21801.
​
Since commencing operations, the Company’s business has consisted primarily of managing and supervising Delmarva and Partners and its principal source of income has been revenues generated by Delmarva and Partners. The Company anticipates that going forward its business will continue to consist primarily of managing and supervising the Affiliate Banks and that its principal source of income will be revenues generated by the Affiliate Banks.
​
The Company provides various services to the Affiliate Banks which include, but are not limited to, management assistance, internal auditing services, compliance management, financial reporting and training, and vendor management support.
​
The Bank of Delmarva. Delmarva, a community oriented financial institution, was established in Maryland in 1896, reorganized as a national bank in 1996, and reorganized as a Delaware state chartered bank in 2003. Delmarva provides a broad range of commercial and consumer banking services to individuals, small and medium-sized businesses and professionals in Southern New Jersey and the eastern shore regions of Maryland and Delaware, including Sussex County, Delaware, Wicomico County, Maryland and Worcester County, Maryland. Delmarva currently operates 15 full service banking offices, located in Delmar, Salisbury and Ocean City, Maryland and Laurel, Dagsboro, and Rehoboth, Delaware, and Cherry Hill, Evesham and Moorestown, New Jersey, along with 16 automated teller machines (“ATMs”). In March 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Liberty Bell Bank through a merger with Delmarva, with Delmarva being the surviving entity. Through the merger, Delmarva gained the branches in Cherry Hill, Evesham and Moorestown, New Jersey, which are operated under the name Liberty Bell Bank, a Division of The Bank of Delmarva. Delmarva’s main office is located at 910 Norman Eskridge Highway, Seaford, Delaware.
​
Delmarva has five consolidated subsidiaries, three of which are wholly owned, organized to hold foreclosed real estate. 
​
Virginia Partners Bank. Partners is headquartered in Fredericksburg, Virginia, which is also the location of an operations center. Partners has two branches in Fredericksburg, Virginia, one branch in Spotsylvania, Virginia, and a full service branch and commercial banking office in Reston, Virginia. In Maryland, Partners trades under the name Maryland Partners Bank (a division of Virginia Partners Bank), and operates a full service branch and commercial banking office in La Plata, Maryland and a Loan Production Office in Annapolis, Maryland. Partners engages in the general banking business and provides financial services to the communities in and around the Greater Fredericksburg, Virginia area, the Greater Washington, DC area (the District of Columbia, Arlington County, Clarke County, Fairfax County, Fauquier County, Loudoun County, Prince William County, Warren County, and the Cities of Alexandria, 

3



Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, Manassas Park, and Reston, Virginia) and Anne Arundel County and the three counties of Southern Maryland (Charles County, Calvert County and St. Mary’s County). 
​
Partners has two wholly owned subsidiaries and one majority owned subsidiary. Bear Holdings, Inc. was established in 2011 for the purpose of holding properties acquired through foreclosure that are classified as other real estate owned. In 2012, 410 William Street, LLC was formed for the purpose of acquiring and holding an interest in the property at 410 William Street, which houses one of Partners’ five branches, including the executive offices. On January 1, 2018, Partners acquired a 51% ownership interest in Johnson Mortgage Company, LLC (“JMC”), which is a residential mortgage company headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, with branch offices in Fredericksburg and Williamsburg, Virginia. JMC is engaged in the mortgage banking business in which JMC originates, closes, and immediately sells mortgage loans and related servicing rights to permanent investors in the secondary market. The financial position and operating results of these subsidiaries are included in Partners consolidated financial statements. For JMC, Partners reflects the issued and outstanding interest not held by Partners in its consolidated financial statements as noncontrolling interest.
​
Merger Agreement with OceanFirst
​
On November 4, 2021, the Company announced the signing of a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of November 4, 2021, pursuant to which the Company will be acquired by OceanFirst Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation (“OCFC”), and Delmarva and Partners will be merged with and into OceanFirst Bank N.A., the wholly owned national banking subsidiary of OCFC. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Company common stock (other than Exception Shares, as defined in the merger agreement), will be converted into the right to receive either 0.4512 shares of common stock of OCFC or $10.00, in each case, at the election of the holder of Company common stock, subject to a maximum of forty percent (40%) of the shares of Company common stock being convertible into cash and the allocation and proration provisions of the merger agreement. For more information on this pending transaction refer to Note 22—Transaction with OceanFirst Financial Corporation to the audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 4, 2021.
​
Business Strategy
​
The Company is a multi-bank holding company, whose wholly owned subsidiaries are Delmarva and Partners. Combined, these banks make the Company a $1.6 billion in total assets company, serving customers from southern New Jersey and Delaware, into Maryland and Virginia. 
​
As member banks of the "Affiliate Bank" model, the Company’s Affiliate Banks employ hundreds of people and invest millions of dollars into their local economies. Ultimately, the Company’s community banks put families into homes, send kids to college, and provide critical financial support to allow "Main Street businesses" to prosper. 
​
The Affiliate Bank model offers other community banks the best of both worlds: keep what is best about community banking, while enjoying the benefits of a larger, stronger parent company with better access to technology and capital, and improved shareholder liquidity. Affiliate banks keep their own charters, names, boards, and management. Affiliate bank customers experience better service through the combined branch network of the affiliates and the larger lending capacity created by the affiliation.
​
It has been a strategic goal of the Company to add additional affiliate banks to the Company, to create a connected marketplace in the greater mid-Atlantic region. While the pending transaction with OCFC pursuant to the Merger Agreement does not adhere to the Affiliate Bank model, the Company believes it will significantly accelerate and accomplish the larger goal of creating a connected mid-Atlantic region community bank for our customers.

Partners has three distinct market areas for commercial banking: Greater Fredericksburg (Stafford County, Spotsylvania County, King George County, Caroline County, and the City of Fredericksburg, Virginia); Greater Washington (the District of Columbia, Arlington County, Clarke County, Fairfax County, Fauquier County, Loudoun County, Prince William County, Warren County, and the Cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, Manassas Park, and Reston, Virginia); and, Anne Arundel County and the three counties of Southern Maryland (Charles County, Calvert County and St. Mary’s County). The markets for JMC include the Newport News/Williamsburg, Virginia markets, and Greater Fredericksburg.
​
The Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV MSA, where all of Partners branches are located, had a combined deposit market of $357 billion as of June 30, 2021. Partners was ranked 33rd out of 72 financial institutions, with total deposits of $509 million as of June 30, 2021. In Fredericksburg City, Virginia, Partners was ranked 3rd, with a 12.63% market share, as of June 30, 2021. In Spotsylvania County, Virginia, Partners was ranked 4th, with a 8.71% market share, as of June 30, 2021. In Charles County, Maryland, Partners was ranked 9th, with a 2.61% market share, as of June 30, 2021. 
​
Competition
​
Both Delmarva and Partners face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and the origination of loans from other community banks and larger banks with regional or national footprints. The Affiliate Banks also face competition from other financial services companies such as brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies and nonbank and online depositories and lenders. Larger bank competitors may have many offices operating over a wide geographic area. Among the advantages such large banks have over Delmarva and Partners is their ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns, and by virtue of their greater total capitalization, to have substantially higher lending limits than Delmarva and Partners. Factors such as interest rates offered, the number and location of branches and the types of products offered, as well as the reputation of the institution, affect competition for deposits and loans. 
​
Both Delmarva and Partners differentiate themselves from their competitors through superior customer service and responsiveness with accountability to a local management team, board of directors and advisory board. The Company believes that its multi-bank model permits its Affiliate Banks to maintain their character as community banks and the close relationships they maintain with their customers and communities, while affiliating with a larger organization that can provide more sophisticated technology and products, access to capital and support and guidance from partnered institutions. 
​
Risk Management
​
The Company believes that effective risk management is of primary importance. Risk management refers to the activities by which the Company identifies, measures, monitors, evaluates and manages the risks it faces in the course of its banking activities. These include liquidity, interest rate, credit, operational, compliance, regulatory, strategic, financial and reputational risk exposures. The Company’s and the Affiliate Banks’ boards of directors and management teams have created a risk-conscious culture that is focused on quality growth, which starts with capable and experienced risk management teams and infrastructure capable of addressing the evolving risks the Company faces, as well as the changing regulatory and compliance landscape. The Company’s risk management approach employs comprehensive policies and processes to establish robust governance. The Company believes a disciplined and conservative underwriting approach has been the key to its strong asset quality.
​
The lending activities in which the Affiliate Banks engage carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations. As such, interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve and general economic conditions, nationally and in Delmarva’s and Partners’ market areas, could have a significant impact on Delmarva’s and Partners’ results of operations, respectively. To the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations in full, in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the value and liquidity of property pledged as security for loans.
​

Through its Affiliate Banks, the Company’s goal is to mitigate risks in the event of unforeseen threats to the loan portfolio as a result of economic downturn or other negative influences. Plans for mitigating inherent risks in managing loan assets include: carefully enforcing loan policies and procedures, evaluating each borrower’s business plan during the underwriting process and throughout the loan term, identifying and monitoring primary and alternative sources for loan repayment, and obtaining collateral to mitigate economic loss in the event of liquidation. Specific loan reserves are established based upon credit and/or collateral risks on an individual loan basis. A risk rating system is employed to proactively estimate loss exposure and provide a measuring system for setting general and specific reserve allocations. The Affiliate Bank’s management, lending officers and credit administration teams emphasize a strong risk management culture supported by comprehensive policies and procedures for credit underwriting, funding and administration that the Affiliate Banks believe have enabled them to maintain sound asset quality. The underwriting methodology emphasizes establishing and monitoring strong overall cash flow throughout a customer’s business operations, appropriate loan-to-value ratios, full or partial guarantors when deemed necessary, and/or strong tertiary sources of re-payment. The Affiliate Banks’ tiered underwriting structure includes progressive levels of individual loan authority, concurrent authority and senior loan committee approval. The Affiliate Banks’ loan review function performs regular internal loan reviews and identifies early warning indicators to proactively monitor the loan portfolio. Asset quality is regularly reported to, and monitored by, the Company’s and Affiliate Banks’ boards of directors. 
​
Each of the Affiliate Banks’ lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by state and federal law. These limits will increase or decrease in response to increases or decreases in its level of capital. At December 31, 2021, Delmarva had a legal lending limit of $14.2 million. At December 31, 2021, Delmarva’s average funded loan size outstanding for commercial real estate (including commercial construction) and commercial loans was $571 thousand and $147 thousand, respectively. At December 31, 2021, Partners had a legal lending limit of $8.4 million. At December 31, 2021, Partners average funded loan size outstanding for commercial real estate (including commercial construction) and commercial loans was $583 thousand and $137 thousand, respectively.
​
Concentrations of Credit Risk. Most of the Company’s lending is conducted with businesses and individuals in eastern shore regions of Maryland and Delaware and in southern New Jersey (through Delmarva) and Fredericksburg, Virginia, Reston, Virginia, Charles County, Maryland and Anne Arundel County, Maryland (through Partners). The Company’s loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial real estate loans, including construction and land loans, which totaled $750.2 million and constituted 67.2% of total loans as of December 31, 2021, and 1-4 family residential real estate loans, which totaled $201.2 million and constituted 18.0% of total loans as of December 31, 2021. The geographic concentration of the Company’s loans subjects its business to the general economic conditions within that market area. The risks created by such concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The Company’s management believes the allowance for credit losses of each Affiliate Bank is adequate to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolios of each respective Affiliate Bank as of December 31, 2021.
​
Comprehensive risk management practices and appropriate capital levels are essential elements of a sound commercial real estate lending program. A concentration in commercial real estate adds a dimension of risk that compounds the risk inherent in individual loans. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that institutions that have (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land which represent 100% or more of an institution’s total risk-based capital; or (ii) total reported commercial real estate loans, excluding loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate, representing 300% or more of the institution’s total risk-based capital and the institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months, are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. 
​
Delmarva has a concentration in both non-owner-occupied commercial real estate and construction and land development loans. At December 31, 2021, Delmarva’s non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio constituted 242.3% of capital and its construction, land development and land loans constituted 79.0% of capital.
​

7



Partners has a concentration in both non-owner-occupied commercial real estate and construction and land development loans. At December 31, 2021, Partners’ non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio constituted 205.5% of capital and its construction, land development and land loans constituted 62.7% of capital.
​
Human Capital Resources
​
The Company the Affiliate Banks aim to foster a culture of respect, teamwork, ownership, responsibility, initiative, integrity, and service. The Company’s people are critical to its performance and the achievement of its strategic goals. Accordingly, the Company provides a competitive compensation and benefits program to help meet the needs of our employees, including benefits that incentivize retention and reward longevity. The Company encourages and supports the growth and development of its 234 full-time equivalent employees (as of December 31, 2021) and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. The Company considers relations with its employees to be excellent. The Company’s selection and promotion processes are without bias and include the active recruitment of minorities and women. 
​
Supervision and Regulation
​
The Company’s and the Affiliate Banks’ business and operations are subject to extensive federal and state governmental regulation and supervision. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and rules and regulations that affect or will affect us. This summary is not complete, and the Company refers you to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals for more information. Because regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative and regulatory debate, the Company cannot forecast how federal and state regulation and supervision of financial institutions may change in the future and affect the operations of the Company and the Affiliate Banks. Supervision, regulation, and examination by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), rather than shareholders.
Regulatory Reform. The financial crisis of 2008, including the downturn of global economic, financial and money markets and the threat of collapse of numerous financial institutions, and other events led to the adoption of numerous laws and regulations that apply to, and focus on, financial institutions. The most significant of these laws is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which was enacted on July 21, 2010 and, in part, was intended to implement significant structural reforms to the financial services industry.
The Dodd-Frank Act implemented far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including changes that have significantly affected the business of all bank holding companies and banks, including the Company and the Affiliate Banks. Some of the rules that have been proposed and, in some cases, adopted to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act's mandates are discussed further below. 
In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”) was enacted to reduce the regulatory burden on certain banking organizations, including community banks, by modifying or eliminating certain federal regulatory requirements. The EGRRCPA amended certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and included regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, application of the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures, qualified mortgages, and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. However, federal banking agencies retain broad discretion to impose additional regulatory requirements on banking organizations based on safety and soundness and U.S. financial system stability considerations.
The Company continues to experience ongoing regulatory reform. These regulatory changes could have a significant effect on how the Company and the Affiliate Banks conduct their businesses, including increased compliance costs and other adverse effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Affiliate Banks. The specific implications of potential regulatory reforms cannot yet be fully predicted and will depend to a large extent on the specific regulations that are to be adopted in the future. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and the EGRRCPA are discussed in more detail below.

CARES Act and the PPP. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted in March 2020 to provide economic relief in response to the public health and economic impacts of a novel strain of coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”). Many of the CARES Act’s programs are, and remain, dependent upon the direct involvement of U.S. financial institutions like the Company and the Affiliate Banks. These programs have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Small Business Administration (the “SBA”), the Federal Reserve, and other federal banking agencies, including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over the Company and the Affiliate Banks. The Company continues to assess the impact of statutes, regulations, and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The CARES Act amended the SBA’s 7(a) loan program, in which the Affiliate Banks participate, to create a guaranteed, unsecured loan program, the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”), to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during COVID-19. In December 2020, Congress revived the PPP and allocated additional PPP funds for 2021. The application deadline for PPP loans expired on May 31, 2021. As participating lenders in the PPP, the Affiliate Banks have continued to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto, including updates to guidance on loan forgiveness.
The American Rescue Plan. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “American Rescue Plan”) to provide additional relief and address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The American Rescue Plan allocates $1.9 trillion in funding for a multitude of programs addressing the national economy, public health, state and local governments, individuals, and businesses. These programs include, among others, (i) small business assistance, including modification and expansion of the PPP, (ii) extension of unemployment benefits and related services, (iii) tax relief related to unemployment compensation, (iv) a maximum tax recovery rebate of $1,400 per eligible individual, and (v) the expansion and modification of certain tax credits, including the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit. These programs have been implemented by the responsible federal agencies and the Company continues to monitor developments related to the American Rescue Plan.
The Company. The Company is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) and subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe and unsound banking practices. As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve an annual report and such other additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve may also examine the Company and each of its subsidiaries. 
The BHC Act requires approval of the Federal Reserve for, among other things, a bank holding company’s direct or indirect acquisition of control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all the assets, of any bank or the merger or consolidation by a bank holding company with another bank holding company. The BHC Act generally permits the acquisition by a bank holding company of control or substantially all the assets of any bank located in a state other than the home state of the bank holding company, except where the bank has not been in existence for the minimum period of time required by state law; but if the bank is at least five years old, the Federal Reserve may approve the acquisition. The Federal Reserve has adopted a final rule codifying the presumptions used in determinations of whether a company has the ability to exercise a controlling influence over another company for purposes of the BHC Act, and providing greater transparency on the types of relationships that the Federal Reserve generally views as supporting a determination of control.

With limited exceptions, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing service for its authorized subsidiaries. A bank holding company may, however, engage in, or acquire an interest in, a company that engages in activities which the Federal Reserve has determined by order or regulation to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. In making such a determination, the Federal Reserve is required to consider whether the performance of such activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, which outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve is also empowered to differentiate between activities commenced de novo and activities commenced by the acquisition, in whole or in part, of a going concern.
The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.
Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on any extensions of credit to a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, or investments in the stock or other securities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Further, a bank holding company and any subsidiary bank are prohibited from engaging in tie-in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit. A subsidiary bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that: (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to such bank other than a loan, discount, deposit or trust service; (ii) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or service from or to the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (iii) the customer not obtain some other credit, property or service from competitors, except for reasonable requirements to assure the soundness of credit extended.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the “GLB Act”) allows a bank holding company or other company to elect to become a financial holding company, which would allow that company to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to such activities, or are complementary to such activities. The GLB Act enumerates certain activities that are deemed financial in nature, such as underwriting insurance or acting as an insurance principal, agent or broker, underwriting, dealing in or making markets in securities, and engaging in merchant banking under certain restrictions. It also authorizes the Federal Reserve to determine by regulation what other activities are financial in nature, or incidental or complementary thereto. The Company has not elected financial holding company status.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. In addition, where a bank holding company has more than one FDIC-insured bank or thrift subsidiary, like the Company, each of the bank holding company’s subsidiary FDIC-insured depository institutions is responsible for any losses to the FDIC as a result of an affiliated depository institution’s failure. As a result of a bank holding company’s source of strength obligation, a bank holding company may be required to provide funds to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules. Any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely would be unsecured and subordinated to such bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of Delmarva and Partners.
A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain conditions.

As a Maryland corporation, the Company is subject to limitations on and requirements for its activities. For example, state law restrictions include limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors, distributions to shareholders, transactions involving directors, officers or interested shareholders, maintenance of books, records, minutes, borrowing and the observance of corporate formalities.
The Affiliate Banks. Delmarva is a Delaware chartered commercial bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System (a “state member bank”) whose accounts are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the maximum legal limits. Delmarva is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the State Bank Commissioner of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Commissioner”) and the Federal Reserve. 
Partners is a Virginia chartered commercial bank and also a state member bank whose accounts are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the maximum legal limits. Partners is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the “Virginia Bureau”) and the Federal Reserve.
The regulations of these various agencies govern most aspects of Delmarva’s and Partners’ businesses, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowing, dividends and location and number of branch offices. The laws and regulations governing the Affiliate Banks generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the DIF, and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders. Competition among commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions has increased following enactment of legislation, which greatly expanded the ability of banks and bank holding companies to engage in interstate banking or acquisition activities.
Banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the differences between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest received by a bank on loans extended to its customers and securities held in its investment portfolio constitute the major portion of Delmarva’s and Partners’ earnings. Thus, the earnings and growth of both Affiliate Banks will be subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money through various means including open market dealings in United States government securities. The nature and timing of changes in such policies and their impact on Delmarva and Partners cannot be predicted.
Branching and Interstate Banking. The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate bank merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks has opted out of the interstate bank merger provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the “Riegle-Neal Act”) by adopting a law after the date of enactment of the Riegle-Neal Act and prior to June 1, 1997 which applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Such interstate bank mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration limitations described in the Riegle-Neal Act. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes national and state banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch.

Capital Requirements.
Basel III Capital Framework. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and standards for calculating risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital measurements (collectively, the “Basel III Final Rules”) that apply to banking institutions they supervise. For the purposes of these capital rules, (i) common equity tier 1 capital (“CET1”) consists principally of common stock (including surplus) and retained earnings; (ii) Tier 1 capital consists principally of CET1 plus non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and certain grandfathered cumulative preferred stocks and trust preferred securities; and (iii) Tier 2 capital consists of other capital instruments, principally qualifying subordinated debt and preferred stock, and limited amounts of an institution’s allowance for loan losses. Each regulatory capital classification is subject to certain adjustments and limitations, as implemented by the Basel III Final Rules. The Basel III Final Rules also establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, importantly including applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans.
The Basel III Final Rules and minimum capital ratios required to be maintained by banks were effective January 1, 2015. The Basel III Final Rules also include a requirement that banks maintain additional capital (the “capital conservation buffer”), which was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and was fully phased in effective January 1, 2019. The Basel III Final Rules and fully phased in capital conservation buffer require banks to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the minimum CET1 ratio, effectively resulting in a required ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a required Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a required total capital ratio of 10.5%) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, subject to certain adjustments and limitations.
The Basel III Final Rules provide deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital measures, primarily to CET1, including deductions and adjustments that were not applied to reduce CET1 under historical regulatory capital rules. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10.0% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15.0% of CET1.
The capital ratios described above are the minimum levels that the federal banking agencies expect. State and federal regulators have the discretion to require an institution to maintain higher capital levels based upon its concentrations of loans, the risk of its lending or other activities, the performance of its loan and investment portfolios and other factors. Failure to maintain such higher capital expectations could result in a lower composite regulatory rating, which would impact the institution’s deposit insurance premiums and could affect its ability to borrow and costs of borrowing, and could result in additional or more severe enforcement actions. In respect of institutions with high concentrations of loans in areas deemed to be higher risk, or during periods of significant economic stress, regulators may require an institution to maintain a higher level of capital, and/or to maintain more stringent risk management measures, than those required by these regulations.
As of December 31, 2021, the Affiliate Banks met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Final Rules, including the capital conservation buffer on a fully phased-in basis.

Community Bank Leverage Ratio. As a result of the EGRRCPA, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion, such as either of the Affiliate Banks or the Company. On October 29, 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that implements the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework (the “CBLRF”). To qualify for the CBLRF, a bank must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities, and a leverage ratio greater than 9.0%. A bank that elects the CBLRF and has a leverage ratio greater than 9.0% will be considered to be in compliance with Basel III capital requirements and exempt from the complex Basel III calculations and will also be deemed “well capitalized” under Prompt Corrective Action regulations, discussed below. A bank that falls out of compliance with the CBLRF will have a two-quarter grace period to come back into full compliance, provided its leverage ratio remains above 8.0% (a bank will be deemed “well capitalized” during the grace period). The CBLRF became available for banking organizations to use as of March 31, 2020 (with the flexibility for banking organizations to subsequently opt into or out of the CBLRF, as applicable). Neither the Company nor the Affiliate Banks have elected to use the CBLRF.
Small Bank Holding Company. The EGRRCPA also expanded the category of bank holding companies that may rely on the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying bank holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. In addition to meeting the asset threshold, a bank holding company must not engage in significant nonbanking activities, not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, and not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (subject to certain exceptions). The Federal Reserve may, in its discretion, exclude any bank holding company from the application of the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes.
In August 2018, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule to apply the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement to bank holding companies with consolidated total assets of less than $3 billion. The policy statement, which, among other things, exempts certain bank holding companies from minimum consolidated regulatory capital ratios that apply to other bank holding companies. As a result of the interim final rule, which was effective August 30, 2018, the Company expects that it will be treated as a small bank holding company and will not be subject to regulatory capital requirements. The comment period on the interim final rule closed on October 29, 2018 and, to date, the Federal Reserve has not issued a final rule to replace the interim final rule. The Affiliate Banks remain subject to the regulatory capital requirements described above.
Prompt Corrective Action. Under Section 38 of the FDIA, each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for institutions which it regulates. The federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action established by Section 38 of the FDIA. The federal banking agencies have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” These terms are defined under uniform regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies regulating these institutions. An insured depository institution that is less than adequately capitalized must adopt an acceptable capital restoration plan, is subject to increased regulatory oversight and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities. As of December 31, 2021, both Affiliate Banks were considered “well capitalized.”
Limits on Dividends. The Company, as a Maryland corporation, is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from the Affiliate Banks. A significant portion of the revenues of the Company result from dividends paid to it by the Affiliate Banks. Both the Company and the Affiliate Banks remain subject to laws and regulations that limit the payment of dividends, including limits on the sources of dividends and requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums. In particular, Federal Reserve supervisory guidance indicates that the Federal Reserve may have safety and soundness concerns if a bank holding company pays dividends that exceed earnings for the period in which the dividend is being paid. Further, the FDIA prohibits insured depository institutions such as the Affiliate Banks from making capital distributions, including paying dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become undercapitalized as defined in the statute. The Company does not expect that any of these laws, regulations or policies will materially affect the ability of the Company or the Affiliate Banks to pay dividends.

13



Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking agencies. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. In addition, the FDIC could terminate the institution’s deposit insurance if it determines that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that violated an applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulators.
Congress, the federal bank agencies and other government agencies have called for or proposed additional regulation and restrictions on the activities, practices and operations of banks and their holding companies. Congress and the federal banking agencies have broad authority to require all banks and holding companies to adhere to more rigorous or costly operating procedures, corporate governance procedures, or to engage in activities or practices which they would not otherwise elect. Any such requirement could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.
Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. A bank’s CRA performance is also considered in evaluating applications seeking approval for mergers, acquisitions, and new offices or facilities. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations being imposed. Additionally, banks must publicly disclose the terms of certain CRA-related agreements. These factors also are considered in evaluating share exchanges, mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. In their most recent CRA evaluations, each Affiliate Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating. 
Fair and Responsible Banking. Banks and other financial institutions are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to promote fair and responsible banking and prohibit unlawful discrimination and unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in banking. These laws include, among others, the Dodd-Frank Act, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Housing Act. Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those listed above. These federal, state and local laws regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with customers taking deposits, making loans or conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, and actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), an independent federal agency within the Federal Reserve System having broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the consumer financial privacy provisions of the GLB Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Smaller institutions, including Delmarva and Partners, are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking agencies for compliance with federal consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB also has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.
The CFPB has proposed or issued a number of important rules affecting a wide range of consumer financial products. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and CFPB rulemakings and enforcement policies may impact the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to make, or the desirability of making, certain types of loans, require us to change our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business or profitability.

The CFPB has concentrated much of its rulemaking efforts on reforms related to residential mortgage transactions. The CFPB has issued rules related to a borrower’s ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, requirements for high cost mortgages, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. The CFPB has also issued rules establishing integrated disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closed end, real estate secured consumer loans; and rules which, among other things, expand the scope of information lenders must report in connection with mortgage and other housing-related loan applications under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. These rules include significant regulatory and compliance changes and are expected to have a broad impact on the financial services industry.
The rule implementing the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that lenders determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay a mortgage loan, established certain minimum requirements for creditors when making ability to pay determinations, and established certain protections from liability for mortgages meeting the definition of “qualified mortgages.” Generally, the rule applies to all consumer-purpose, closed-end loans secured by a dwelling including home-purchase loans, refinances and home equity loans—whether first or subordinate lien. The rule does not cover, among other things, home equity lines of credit or other open-end credit; temporary or “bridge” loans with a term of 12 months or less, such as a loan to finance the initial construction of a dwelling; a construction phase of 12 months or less of a construction-to-permanent loan; and business-purpose loans, even if secured by a dwelling. The rule afforded greater legal protections for lenders making qualified mortgages that are not “higher priced.” Qualified mortgages must generally satisfy detailed requirements related to product features, underwriting standards, and a points and fees requirement whereby the total points and fees on a mortgage loan cannot exceed specified amounts or percentages of the total loan amount. Mandatory features of a qualified mortgage include: (i) a loan term not exceeding 30 years; and (ii) regular periodic payments that do not result in negative amortization, deferral of principal repayment, or a balloon payment. Further, the rule clarified that qualified mortgages do not include “no-doc” loans and loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, or balloon payments. The rule created special categories of qualified mortgages originated by certain smaller creditors. Under the EGRRCPA, most residential mortgage loans originated and held in portfolio by a bank with less than $10 billion in assets will be designated as “qualified mortgages.” Higher-priced qualified mortgages (e.g., sub-prime loans) receive a rebuttable presumption of compliance with ability-to-repay rules, and other qualified mortgages (e.g., prime loans) are deemed to comply with the ability-to-repay rules.
FDIC Insurance. The deposits of the Affiliate Banks are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the standard maximum insurance amount for each deposit insurance ownership category. The basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured institution, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes. The FDIC may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If deposit insurance is terminated, the deposits at the institution at the time of termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period from six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances that could result in termination of the Affiliate Banks’ deposit insurance.
The DIF is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions calculated based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital). As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a large-bank pricing assessment scheme, set a target “designated reserve ratio” (described in more detail below) of 2.0% for the DIF and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2.0% and 2.5%. An institution's assessment rate is based on a statistical analysis of financial ratios that estimates the likelihood of failure over a three-year period, which considers the institution’s weighted average CAMELS component rating, and is subject to further adjustments including those related to levels of unsecured debt and brokered deposits (not applicable to banks with less than $10 billion in assets). At December 31, 2021, total base assessment rates for institutions that have been insured for at least five years range from 1.5 to 30 basis points applying to banks with less than $10 billion in assets.

15



The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the “designated reserve ratio.” The FDIA requires that the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis. As of December 31, 2021, the designated reserve ratio was 2.00 percent and the minimum designated reserve ratio was 1.35 percent.
In June 2020, the FDIC adopted a final rule that generally removes the effect of PPP lending when calculating a bank’s deposit insurance assessment by providing an offset to the bank’s total assessment amount for the increase in the assessment base attributable to the bank’s participation in the PPP. This final rule began applying to FDIC deposit insurance assessments during the second quarter of 2020.
Concentration and Risk Guidance. The federal banking agencies promulgated joint interagency guidance regarding material direct and indirect asset and funding concentrations. The guidance defines a concentration as any of the following: (i) asset concentrations of 25% or more of Total Capital (loan related) or Tier 1 Capital (non-loan related) by individual borrower, small interrelated group of individuals, single repayment source or individual project; (ii) asset concentrations of 100% or more of Total Capital (loan related) or Tier 1 Capital (non-loan related) by industry, product line, type of collateral, or short-term obligations of one financial institution or affiliated group; (iii) funding concentrations from a single source representing 10% or more of Total Assets; or (iv) potentially volatile funding sources that when combined represent 25% or more of Total Assets (these sources may include brokered, large, high-rate, uninsured, internet-listing-service deposits, Federal funds purchased or other potentially volatile deposits or borrowings). If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, third party review and increasing capital requirements. Delmarva and Partners adhere to the practices recommended in this guidance.
Additionally, the federal banking agencies have issued guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that institutions that have: (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land which represent 100% or more of an institution’s total risk-based capital; or (ii) total reported commercial real estate loans, excluding loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate, representing 300% or more of the institution’s total risk-based capital and the institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months, are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions that are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital.
Brokered Deposits. Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of any bank to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it is “well capitalized” or, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” However, as a result of the EGRRCPA, the FDIC has undertaken a comprehensive review of its regulatory approach to brokered deposits, including reciprocal deposits, and interest rate caps applicable to banks that are less than “well capitalized.” On December 15, 2020, the FDIC issued final rules that amend the FDIC’s methodology for calculating interest rate caps, provide a new process for banks that seek FDIC approval to offer a competitive rate on deposits when the prevailing rate in the bank’s local market exceeds the national rate cap, and provides specific exemptions and streamlined application and notice procedures for certain deposit-placement arrangements that are not subject to brokered deposit restrictions. These final rules became effective on April 1, 2021. There has been no material impact to the Company or the Affiliate Banks from the new rule.
USA PATRIOT Act. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to detect, and prevent, the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum standards specified by the act, follow minimum standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and regularly compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. The costs or other effects of the compliance burdens imposed by the USA PATRIOT Act or future anti-terrorist, homeland security or anti-money laundering legislation or regulation cannot be predicted with certainty.

16



Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”), which is intended to require financial institutions to develop policies, procedures and practices to prevent and deter money laundering, mandates that every bank have a written, board-approved program that is reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the BSA. The program must, at a minimum: (i) provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance; (ii) provide for independent testing for compliance; (iii) designate an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance; and (iv) provide training for appropriate personnel. In addition, banks are required to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”). In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The regulations implementing the BSA explicitly include risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence, to include understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile. In addition, banks must identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of all legal entity customers (other than those that are excluded) at the time a new account is opened (other than accounts that are exempted).
Office of Foreign Assets Control. The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, foreign nationals and others, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on a “U.S. person” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of a sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Corporate Transparency Act. On January 1, 2021, as part of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress enacted the Corporate Transparency Act (“CTA”), which requires FinCEN to issue regulations implementing reporting requirements for “reporting companies” (as defined in the CTA) to disclose beneficial ownership interests of certain U.S. and foreign entities by January 1, 2022. The CTA imposes additional reporting requirements on entities not previously subject to such beneficial ownership disclosure regulations and also contains exemptions for several different types of entities, including among others, certain banks and bank holding companies. Non-compliance with FinCEN regulations promulgated under the CTA may result in civil fines as well as criminal penalties.
In December 2021, FinCEN proposed the first of three sets of rules to implement the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of the CTA, with subsequent rulemakings expected (i) to implement the CTA’s protocols for access to and disclosure of beneficial ownership information, and (ii) to revise the existing customer due diligence requirements that apply to the Company, the Affiliate Banks and many other financial institutions, to ensure consistency between these requirements and the beneficial ownership reporting rules. The Company is unable to determine the ultimate impact, if any, of FinCEN’s regulations on the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Affiliate Banks. The Company will continue to monitor developments related to the FinCEN rules, including future FinCEN rulemakings.
Increased Focus on Lending to Members of the Military. The federal banking agencies and the U.S. Department of Justice have recently increased their focus on financial institution compliance with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (the “SCRA”). The SCRA requires a bank to cap the interest rate at 6% for any loan to a member of the military who goes on active duty after taking out the loan. It also limits the actions Delmarva or Partners can take when a servicemember is in foreclosure. The EGRRCPA also adds certain protections for consumers, including veterans and active duty military personnel, expanded credit freezes and creation of an identity theft protection database.

17



Incentive Compensation. The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC have issued regulatory guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” The findings will be included in reports of examination, and deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
In 2016, the SEC and the federal banking agencies proposed rules that prohibit covered financial institutions (including bank holding companies and banks) from establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing covered persons (consisting of senior executive officers and significant risk takers, as defined in the rules) with excessive compensation, fees or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution. The proposed rules outline factors to be considered when analyzing whether compensation is excessive and whether an incentive-based compensation arrangement encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material loss to the covered financial institution, and establishes minimum requirements that incentive-based compensation arrangements must meet to be considered to not encourage inappropriate risks and to appropriately balance risk and reward. The proposed rules also impose additional corporate governance requirements on the boards of directors of covered financial institutions and impose additional record-keeping requirements. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not yet been published. At this time, the Company cannot predict what impact, if any, the final rule will have on its operations. 
Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and places limits on ownership of equity investments in private equity and hedge funds. The EGRRCPA exempted all banks with less than $10 billion in assets (including their holding companies and affiliates) from the Volcker Rule, provided that the institution has total trading assets and liabilities of 5.0% or less of total assets, subject to certain limited exceptions. On July 9, 2019, the federal banking agencies along with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the SEC issued a final rule to exclude community banks, like the Affiliate Banks, from the application of the Volcker Rule. 
Call Reports and Examination Cycle. All institutions, regardless of size, submit a quarterly call report that includes data used by federal banking agencies to monitor the condition, performance, and risk profile of individual institutions and the industry as a whole. The EGRRCPA contained provisions expanding the number of regulated institutions eligible to use streamline call report forms. In November 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a proposal to permit insured depository institutions with total assets of less than $5 billion that do not engage in certain complex or international activities to file the most streamlined version of the quarterly call report, and to reduce data reportable on certain streamlined call report submissions.
In December 2018, consistent with the provisions of the EGRRCPA, the federal banking agencies jointly adopted final rules that permit banks with up to $3 billion in total assets, that received a composite CAMELS rating of “1” or “2,” and that meet certain other criteria (including not having undergone any change in control during the previous 12-month period, and not being subject to a formal enforcement proceeding or order), to qualify for an 18-month on-site examination cycle. 

18



Stress Testing. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies implemented stress testing requirements for certain financial institutions, including bank holding companies and state-chartered banks, with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. The EGRRCPA subsequently raised the asset thresholds for company-run stress testing and mandatory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve to $50 billion and $100 billion, respectively. Although these requirements do not apply to the Company or the Affiliate Banks, the federal banking agencies emphasize that all banking organizations, regardless of size, should have the capacity to analyze the potential effect of adverse market conditions or outcomes on the organization’s financial condition. Based on existing regulatory guidance, the Company will be expected to consider the institution’s interest rate risk management, commercial real estate loan concentrations and other credit-related information, and funding and liquidity management during this analysis of adverse market conditions or outcomes. 
Confidentiality and Required Disclosures of Customer Information. Under the Federal Right to Privacy Act of 1978, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records, financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. The Affiliate Banks are also subject to various laws and regulations that address the privacy of nonpublic personal financial information of consumers. The GLB Act and certain regulations issued thereunder protect against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumer nonpublic personal information. A financial institution must provide to its customers, at the beginning of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer’s personal financial information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that the information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. 
In August 2018, the CFPB published its final rule to update Regulation P pursuant to the amended GLB Act. Under this rule, certain qualifying financial institutions are not required to provide annual privacy notices to customers. To qualify, a financial institution must not share nonpublic personal information about customers except as described in certain statutory exceptions which do not trigger a customer’s statutory opt-out right. In addition, the financial institution must not have changed its disclosure policies and practices from those disclosed in its most recent privacy notice. The rule sets forth timing requirements for delivery of annual privacy notices in the event that a financial institution that qualified for the annual notice exemption later changes its policies or practices in such a way that it no longer qualifies for the exemption. 
Although these laws and programs impose compliance costs and create privacy obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, and compliance with all of the laws, programs, and privacy and reporting obligations may require significant resources of the Company, these laws and programs do not materially affect the Company’s products, services or other business activities.
Cybersecurity. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a financial institution’s board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial products and services. 
In particular, in March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. 

19



On November 18, 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to improve the sharing of information about cyber incidents that may affect the U.S. banking system. The rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator of any significant computer-security incident as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the banking organization determines that a cyber incident has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected—or are reasonably likely to materially affect—the viability of a banking organization’s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. In addition, the rule requires a bank service provider to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect banking organization customers for four or more hours. Compliance with the final rule is required by May 1, 2022. The Company and the Affiliate Banks do not anticipate any material impact to their respective operations related to this rule at this time.
​
If the Company fails to meet regulatory expectations, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties and may be required to perform remediation efforts that demand significant Company resources. To date, the Company has not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but its systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that the Company could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by the Company and its customers. 
Future Regulation. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the Affiliate Banks. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business.
