ITEM 1. BUSINESS


OUR BUSINESS
​
International Seaways, Inc., a Marshall Islands corporation incorporated in 1999, and its wholly owned subsidiaries own and operate a fleet of oceangoing vessels engaged primarily in the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products in the International Flag trade. Our vessel operations are organized into two segments: Crude Tankers and Product Carriers. At December 31, 2020, we owned or operated an International Flag fleet of 36 vessels (totaling an aggregate of 6.1 million dwt), consisting of VLCC, Suezmax, Aframax, Panamax crude tankers, as well as LR1, LR2 and MR product carriers, and through joint venture partnerships, ownership interests in two FSO service vessels (together the “JV Vessels”). The Marshall Islands is the principal flag of registry of our vessels. Additional information about our fleet, including its ownership profile, is set forth under “— Fleet Operations — Fleet Summary,” as well as on the Company’s website, www.intlseas.com. Neither our website nor the information contained on that site, or connected to that site, is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Our ultimate customers, including those of the commercial pools in which we participate, include major independent and state-owned oil companies, oil traders, refinery operators and international government entities. We generally charter our vessels to customers either for specific voyages at spot rates through the services of pools in which the Company participates, or for specific periods of time at fixed daily rates through time charters or bareboat charters. Spot market rates are highly volatile, while time charter and bareboat charter rates provide more predictable streams of TCE revenues because they are fixed for specific periods of time. For a more detailed discussion on factors influencing spot and time charter markets, see “— Fleet Operations — Commercial Management” below.
​
2020 IN REVIEW
​
Shipping revenues and TCE Revenues achieved in 2020 were $421.6 million and $402.0 million, respectively, of which approximately 79% were generated from our Crude Tankers segment. Income from vessel operations decreased by $15.3 million to $39.9 million in 2020, from $55.2 million in 2019, primarily driven by $103.0 million of vessel impairment charges recognized during 2020. We achieved an Adjusted EBITDA (see Item 6 – Selected Financial Data for definition) of $220.1 million in 2020 compared to $164.7 million in 2019. In addition, we generated $216.1 million cash from operations, made capital investments totaling $76.2 million for vessel purchases, vessel improvements and drydocking, paid cash dividends of $6.8 million, and repurchased shares of our common stock at a total cost of $30.0 million. 
​
Our goals for 2020 were to (i) execute our business strategy in a manner consistent with the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) principles described further below, (ii) refinance our high interest debt obligations, (iii) continue to build on our track record as a disciplined capital allocator, (iv) maximize our fleet’s earning potential through opportunistic charter-ins/charter-outs, sales and purchases of vessels and investments in Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (“scrubbers”) on our modern VLCCs, and (v) execute transactions that would ultimately unlock the value of our shares to investors. 
​
Accordingly, during 2020 we:

Proceeds from the January 28, 2020 initial drawdown on the 2020 Debt Facilities of $370 million were used to (i) repay the $331.5 million outstanding principal balance under the 2017 Debt Facilities due 2022 and the $23.2 million outstanding principal balance under the ABN Term Loan Facility due 2023, and (ii) to repurchase the $27.9 million outstanding principal amount of the Company’s 10.75% subordinated notes due 2023 issued pursuant to an indenture dated June 13, 2018 with GLAS Trust Company LLC, as trustee, as amended. The combined effect of (i) the entry into the 2020 Debt Facilities, which lowered our average interest rates on the refinanced portion of our debt by 350 basis points and our overall average interest rates by 200 basis points, (ii) lower LIBOR rates during 2020, and (iii) lower average debt outstanding during 2020, reduced our annual cash interest expense by approximately $25.0 million. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Liquidity and Sources of Capital,” for further details on the refinancing transaction and the 2020 Debt Facilities;

​
OUR STRATEGY
​
Our primary objectives are to (i) maximize stockholder value through the shipping industry cycles by generating strong cash flows through the combination of higher returns available from time to time in the spot market through our participation in a number of commercial pools, coupled with selective time charters; (ii) maintain and grow our Crude Tankers Lightering market share and profits; (iii) maintain cash flows from our joint venture investments; (iv) actively manage the size and composition of our fleet over the course of market cycles to increase investment returns and available capital; (v) enter into value-creating transactions; and (vi) continually strive to reduce the environmental footprint of our vessel operations. The key elements of our strategy are:
​
Generate strong cash flows through a blend of spot market and period market exposure
​
We believe we are well-positioned to generate strong cash flows by identifying and taking advantage of attractive chartering opportunities in the International Flag tanker market. We will continue to pursue an overall chartering strategy which blends a substantial spot rate exposure that provides us with higher returns when the more volatile spot market is stronger with short-term time charters that provide more stable cash flows.
​
We currently deploy the majority of our fleet on a spot rate basis to benefit from market volatility and what we believe are the traditionally higher returns the spot market offers compared with time charters. We believe this strategy continues to offer significant upside exposure to the spot market and an opportunity to capture enhanced profit margins at times when vessel demand exceeds supply. This was demonstrated as demand for crude oil recovered strongly during the fourth quarter of 2019 as the fundamentals that underpinned a robust freight rate market through most of that quarter were further augmented by IMO 2020 related disruptions to fleet supply and increased geopolitical risk during the first half of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we participated in five commercial pools as our principal means of participation in the spot market— Tankers International (“TI”), Dakota Tankers (“DAKOTA”), Penfield Tankers (“PENFIELD”), Panamax International (“PI”), and Clean Products Tankers Alliance (“CPTA”) — each selected for specific expertise in its respective market. Our continued participation in pools allows us to benefit from economies of scale and higher vessel utilization rates.
​

International Seaways, Inc.



We plan to continue to complement our spot chartering strategy by selectively employing a portion of our vessels on time charters that provide consistent cash flows. Accordingly, to take advantage of the dynamic oil tanker markets and reduce risk, we opportunistically locked in four of our VLCCs during the first half of 2020 on time charters for periods ranging from seven months to 36 months at high rates with major oil producing and trading companies. As of December 31, 2020, we have two VLCCs, one LR2 and five of our Panamaxes on time charters expiring between February 2021 and March 2023. In addition, the vessels operated by our FSO Joint Venture are deployed on long-term time charters expiring 2032. We may seek to place other tonnage on time charters, for storage or transport, when we can do so at attractive rates.
​
Actively manage our fleet to maximize return on capital over market cycles.
​
We will continue to actively manage the size and composition of our fleet through opportunistic accretive acquisitions and dispositions as part of our effort to achieve above-market returns on capital for our vessel assets and renew our fleet. Using our commercial, financial and operational expertise, we will continue to execute on our plan to opportunistically grow our fleet through the timely and selective acquisition of high-quality secondhand vessels or resales or newbuild contracts when we believe those acquisitions will result in attractive returns on invested capital and increased cash flow. We also intend to continue to engage in opportunistic dispositions where we can achieve attractive values for our vessels relative to their anticipated future earnings from operations as we assess the market cycle. Taken together, we believe these activities have and will continue to help us maintain a diverse, high-quality and modern fleet of crude oil and refined product vessels with an enhanced return on invested capital. We believe our diverse and versatile fleet, our experience and our long-standing relationships with participants in the crude and refined product shipping industry position us to identify and take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities in any vessel class in the international market.
​
Maintain an appropriate and flexible financial profile.
​
We seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and a prudent financial leverage that positions us to take advantage of attractive strategic opportunities throughout the dynamic tanker cycles of the shipping sector. During 2020, we maintained what we believe to be a reasonable financial leverage for the current point in the tanker cycle and one of the lowest loan to value profiles in the public company shipping sector. As of December 31, 2020, we had total liquidity on a consolidated basis of $255.7 million, comprised of $215.7 million of cash (including $16.3 million of restricted cash) and $40 million of remaining undrawn revolver capacity, as well as a Consolidated Net Debt to Assets Value and Consolidated Net Debt to Book Capital ratios of 32.7% and 24.8%, respectively. 
​
Address Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Environmental, Social and Governance Initiatives
​
Our core philosophy is to transport energy safely and efficiently. We recognize that greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, which are largely caused by burning fossil fuels, contribute to the warming of the global climate system. Our industry, which is heavily dependent on the burning of fossil fuels, faces the dual challenge of reducing its carbon footprint by transitioning to the use of low-carbon fuels while extending the economic and social benefits of delivering energy to consumers across the globe. We welcome and support efforts, such as those led by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”), to increase transparency and to promote investors’ understanding of how we and our industry peers are addressing the climate change-related risks and opportunities particular to our industry. The Company’s governance, strategy, risk management and performance monitoring efforts in this area are evolving and will continue to do so over time:
​
Governance – Our Board of Directors, which includes seven independent members and experts in shipping and compliance, engages in regular discussions relating to environmental matters and the Company’s response to climate change-related risks and opportunities. The Company’s management team, led by the Chief Executive Officer, has the day-to-day responsibility to execute the action plans as approved by the Board of Directors.
​
Strategy – We are committed to Environmental, Social and Governance practices as a part of our core culture. Accordingly, we strive to meet, and when possible and appropriate, exceed minimum compliance levels for all applicable rules and regulations governing the maritime industry, which include the IMO 2020 Regulations described below and the items described in the “Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping” section below. To achieve our goals, we have taken actions which include:
​

- | The establishment of a compliance program to address the IMO 2020 Regulations (as described below);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | The implementation of a third-party data collection and analysis platform which allows data to be gathered from our vessels for use in advanced analytics with the aim of reducing our fuel consumption, and CO2 and GHG emissions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The annual period from October 2018 to September 2019 was our initial year utilizing the platform to drive our “Get to Green” vessel performance optimization program. During the twelve months ending September 2020, we achieved an approximately 8,500-ton reduction in annual fuel consumption across our fleet, which equates to an approximately 26,500-ton reduction in CO2 emissions – the equivalent to the CO2 emitted by 5,725 passenger cars for a year;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | The inclusion of a sustainability-linked pricing mechanism in the 2020 Debt Facilities. The mechanism has been certified by an independent, leading firm in ESG and corporate governance research as meeting sustainability-linked loan principles. The adjustment in pricing will be linked to the carbon efficiency of the INSW fleet as it relates to reductions in CO2 emissions year-over-year, such that it aligns with the IMO’s 50% industry reduction target in GHG emissions by 2050. This key performance indicator is calculated in a manner consistent with the de-carbonization trajectory outlined in the Poseidon Principles, the global framework by which financial institutions can assess the climate alignment of their ship finance portfolios. The relevant emissions data for our fleet will be reported to the applicable Classification Societies, the IMO and the lenders under our sustainability-linked loan facility. We also intend to make such emissions data publicly available;

- | The achievement of compliance with the European Union’s requirements relating to inventories of hazardous materials on board our vessels one year ahead of the mandated timeframe;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Participation on the Board of Directors of the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation, the leading not-for-profit marine ship pollution response advisors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Participation in the Marine Anti-Corruption Network, a global business network of over 100 members whose vision is a maritime industry free of corruption that enables fair trade to the benefit of society at large;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | The installation of Ballast Water Treatment Systems on vessels to comply with all applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Participation as a signatory to the Neptune Declaration on Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew Change, in a worldwide call to action to end the unprecedented crew change crisis caused by COVID-19;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Specifically considering overall fuel consumption when selecting vessel purchase candidates and ships in our fleet to potentially dispose of, in order to reduce our fleet’s contribution to GHG emissions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Making a commitment to implement and practice environmentally and socially responsible ship recycling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, in March 2021, we entered into agreements to construct three dual-fuel LNG VLCCs at Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering’s shipyard, subject to certain conditions customary to similar transactions. We expect these tankers to be well suited to adhere to future environmental regulation throughout their life. Their significant environmental benefits, including substantially reducing our carbon footprint, are in keeping with our commitment to ESG-focused corporate citizenship. Upon delivery in 2023, these VLCCs will be employed on seven-year time charters with oil major – Shell. 
Risk Management – Due to the nature of our business, environmental and climate change-related risks are included in key risks discussed at the Board of Directors level. What we believe to be the most significant of such risks are described in the “Item 1A – Risk Factors” section below.
​
Metrics and Targets – As a part of the actions described in the “Strategy” section above, we are working to meet the carbon efficiency targets included in our sustainability-linked loan and to establish other appropriate metrics by which to measure our performance and drive improvement.

FLEET OPERATIONS
​
Fleet Summary
​
As of December 31, 2020, our operating fleet consisted of 36 vessels, 31 of which were owned and three of which were chartered in. In addition, through joint venture partnerships, INSW has ownership interests in two FSO service vessels. Vessels chartered-in include bareboat charters and time charters. The three chartered-in vessels are currently scheduled to be redelivered to their owners between August 2021 and March 2024. Certain of the charters provide INSW with renewal and purchase options. See Note 15, “Leases,” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional

​
Business Segments
​
The bulk shipping of crude oil and refined petroleum products has many distinct market segments based largely on the size and design configuration of vessels required and, in some cases, on the flag of registry. Freight rates in each market segment are determined by a variety of factors affecting the supply and demand for suitable vessels. Our diverse fleet gives us the ability to provide a broad range of services to global customers. Tankers and Product Carriers are not bound to specific ports or schedules and therefore can respond to market opportunities by moving between trades and geographical areas. The Company has established two reportable business segments: Crude Tankers and Product Carriers.
​
For additional information regarding the Company’s two reportable segments for the three years ended December 31, 2020, see Note 4, “Business and Segment Reporting,” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
​
Crude Tankers (including Crude Tankers Lightering)
​
Our Crude Tankers reportable business segment is made up of a fleet of VLCCs, Suezmaxes, Aframaxes and Panamaxes engaged in the worldwide transportation of crude oil.
​
This segment also includes our Crude Tankers Lightering business through which we provide ship-to-ship (or “STS”) lightering support services and full-service STS lightering to customers in the U.S. Gulf (“USG”), U.S. Pacific, Grand Bahama and Panama regions. In STS lightering support service, we provide the personnel and equipment (hoses and fenders) to facilitate the transferring of cargo between seagoing ships positioned alongside each other, either stationary or underway. In full service STS lightering, we provide the lightering vessel, usually an Aframax tanker, in addition to the personnel and equipment to facilitate the transferring of cargo. Demand for lightering services is significantly affected by the level of crude oil imports by the United States and, in recent years, by the increased volumes of crude oil exports by the United States. Transshipment operations in the USG represented approximately 50% of our lightering volumes during 2020. Our customers include primarily oil companies and trading companies that are importing or exporting crude oil in the USG to or from larger Suezmax and VLCC vessels, which are prevented from using certain ports due to their size and draft.

International Seaways, Inc.



Product Carriers
​
Our Product Carriers reportable business segment consists of a fleet of MRs, LR1s and an LR2 engaged in the worldwide transportation of refined petroleum products. Refined petroleum product cargoes are transported from refineries to consuming markets characterized by both long and short-haul routes. The market for these product cargoes is driven by global refinery capacity, changes in consumer demand and product specifications and cargo arbitrage opportunities. In contrast to the crude oil tanker market, the refined petroleum trades are more complex due to the diverse nature of product cargoes, which include gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, home heating oil, vegetable oils and organic chemicals (e.g., methanol and ethylene glycols). The trades require crews to have specialized certifications. Customer vetting requirements can be more rigorous and, in general, vessel operations are more complex due to the fact that refineries can be in closer proximity to importing nations, resulting in more frequent port calls and more discharging, cleaning and loading operations than crude oil tankers. The Company’s owned MR product carriers are IMO III compliant, allowing those vessels to carry edible oils, such as palm and vegetable oil, increasing flexibility when switching between cargo grades. 
​
In order to take advantage of market conditions and optimize economic performance, we employ our LR1 Product Carriers, which currently participate in the PI pool, in the transportation of crude oil cargoes.
​
Commercial Management
​
Spot Market
​
Voyage charters, including vessels operating in commercial pools that predominantly operate in the spot market, constituted 79% of the Company’s aggregate TCE revenues in 2020, 92% in 2019 and 90% in 2018. Accordingly, the Company’s shipping revenues are significantly affected by the amount of available tonnage both at the time such tonnage is required and over the period of projected use, and the levels of seaborne and shore-based inventories of crude oil and refined products.
​
Seasonal trends affect world oil consumption and consequently vessel demand. While trends in consumption vary with seasons, peaks in demand quite often precede the seasonal consumption peaks as refiners and suppliers try to anticipate consumer demand. Seasonal peaks in oil demand have been principally driven by increased demand prior to Northern Hemisphere winters and increased demand for gasoline prior to the summer driving season in the United States. During 2020, the effects of IMO 2020 Regulations increased and changed trading patterns which had a positive impact on ton-mile demand while also providing some short term disruption to global shipping. Available tonnage is affected over time by the volume of newbuilding deliveries, the number of tankers used to store clean products and crude oil, and the removal (principally through vessel recycling or conversion) of existing vessels from service. Vessel recycling is affected by the level of freight rates, recycling prices, vetting standards established by charterers and terminals and by international and U.S. governmental regulations that establish maintenance standards and regulatory compliance standards.
​
Time and Bareboat Charter Market
​
Our operating fleet currently includes a number of vessels that operate on time charters. Within a contract period, time charters provide a predictable level of revenues without the fluctuations inherent in spot-market rates. Once a time charter expires, however, the ability to secure a new time charter may be uncertain and subject to market conditions at such time. Time and bareboat charters constituted 21% of the Company’s TCE revenues in 2020, 8% in 2019 and 10% in 2018. Our two FSO joint venture vessels are employed under service contracts expiring in 2032. 
​
Commercial Pools and other Commercial Management Arrangements
​
We currently utilize third-party managed pools as the principal commercial strategy for our vessels. By operating a large number of vessels as an integrated transportation system, commercial pools offer customers greater flexibility and a higher level of service while achieving scheduling efficiencies. Pools are commercially managed by experienced commercial operators that, among other things, arrange charters for the vessels participating in the pool in exchange for an administrative fee. Technical management is performed or outsourced by each shipowner. The pools collect revenue from customers, pay voyage-related expenses, and distribute TCE revenues to the participants after deducting administrative fees, according to formulas that capture the contribution of each vessel to the pool by:

● | first summarizing the earnings capacity of each vessel (as determined by the pool operator based largely on the physical characteristics and fuel consumption) to a number of “points;”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

International Seaways, Inc.




● | second, multiplying each vessel’s “points” by the number of days that vessel operated during a specified period (the “Vessel Contribution”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third, multiplying the total number of points of all vessels in the pool by the total number of days all vessels in the pool operated (the “Total Earnings”); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fourth, dividing the Vessel Contribution by the Total Earnings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

Pools negotiate charters with customers primarily in the spot market. The size and scope of these pools enable them to enhance utilization for pool vessels by securing backhaul voyages and Contracts of Affreightment (“COAs”), thereby reducing wait time and providing a high level of service to customers.
​
We also employ third-party commercial managers on a limited basis for some of our vessels in the spot market through Commercial Management Agreements (“CMAs”). Under the CMAs, the manager collects revenue, pays for voyage related expenses and distributes the actual voyage results for each individual ship under management and receives a management fee.
​
The table below summarizes the commercial deployment of our conventional tanker fleet as of December 31, 2020:

During the first quarter of 2021, all four LR1s rejoined the pool and the Panamax was redelivered under its time charter to the pool.

​
Technical Management
​
We have agreements with third-party managers to outsource the technical management of our conventional tanker fleet. The managers supervise the technical management of our vessels to ensure consistent quality and integrity of our operations. We retain a pool of well-trained seafarers to serve on our vessels. We continue to hire the crew, with the managers acting as agents on our behalf.
​
In addition to regular maintenance and repair, crews onboard each vessel and shore-side personnel must ensure that the vessels in the Company’s fleet meet or exceed regulatory standards established by organizations such as the IMO and the U.S. Coast Guard.
​
The JV Vessels are technically managed by our joint venture partner.
​
Joint Ventures
​
We have a 50% interest in the FSO Joint Venture, which owns and operates two custom-made FSO service vessels, each having a capacity of three million barrels, that have been operating in the Al Shaheen field off the coast of Qatar without interruption since 2010. In May 2017, North Oil Company (“NOC”), the operator of the Al Shaheen oil field, awarded two five-year service contracts for the FSO Joint Venture to provide its two vessels to NOC to perform FSO services in the Al Shaheen Field. In October 2020, the FSO Joint Venture signed a 10-year extension on each of the existing service contracts with NOC relating to the two FSO service vessels expiring in 2032. In accordance with the terms of the service contracts under which the two FSO vessels currently operate, the daily rate of hire during the charter term is the sum of the capital expenditure element of hire plus the operating expenditure element of hire. The operating expenditure element of hire is subject to escalation, as provided in the service contracts.

We received cash distributions totaling $54.2 million from the FSO Joint Venture during the three-years ended December 31, 2020, excluding the distribution attributable to the $110 million of proceeds from a term loan facility, which the FSO Joint Venture is a party to (see Note 6, “Equity Method Investments” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), and we estimate we will receive approximately $10.5 million in cash distributions during 2021. The 10-year contract extensions signed in October 2020 shall commence in direct continuation of the existing 5-year service contracts, which were originally scheduled to expire during the third quarter of 2022. Based on International Seaways’ ownership interest in the FSO Joint Venture, the 10-year contract extensions are expected to generate in excess of $322 million in contract revenues for the Company.

​
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
​
We depend on our workforce to provide superior service and to ensure our vessels are operated safely and securely. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 764 employees comprised of 719 seafarers employed on our fleet and 45 shore-side staff. The seafarers are hired by the technical managers acting as agent for the individual ship owning companies, each of which is a subsidiary of INSW.
Safety
​
We are committed to creating a safe, healthy and secure workplace at sea and ashore. We are also committed to providing safe, reliable and environmentally sound transportation to our customers. Integral to meeting standards mandated by worldwide regulators and customers is a ship manager’s use of robust Safety Management Systems (“SMS”). The SMS is a framework of processes and procedures that addresses a spectrum of operational risks associated with quality, environment, health and safety. The SMS is certified by the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), promulgated by the IMO and the International Standards Organization (“ISO”), and meets ISO 9001 (Quality Management) and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management). To support a culture of transparency, accountability and compliance, we have an open reporting system on all of our ships, whereby seafarers can anonymously report possible violations of our or our third-party technical and commercial manager’s policies and procedures. All open reports are investigated, and appropriate actions are taken when necessary.
​
Employee Welfare, Growth and Development
​
The development, attraction and retention of employees at sea and ashore is a critical success factor for the Company for succession planning and sustaining our core values. To support the advancement of our employees, we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within. We leverage both formal and informal programs to identify, foster, and retain top seafarer and shore-based talent. On average, our seafarers have worked for us for more than 10 years and more than half of our shore-based employees have worked for us for at least 13 years. For our seafarers, ongoing training is integral to conducting safe operations and keeping employees engaged. One key part of our training regimen is our crew conferences. Senior leaders from the Company, our fleet and our third-party managers spend three days with up to 100 seafarers from across our fleet, representing all ranks and nationalities. During the conferences, the seafarers are updated on new policies, regulations, and procedures.  Interactive learning sessions and team building exercises are used to foster communication and shared learnings. Day long training sessions are capped off with a social agenda that celebrates successes through the year and includes the presentation of awards for long time service with the company. This presents management with both an opportunity to teach and to learn and provides everyone with an excellent networking opportunity. 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) recognized the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic. We implemented various measures to protect our seafarers and shore-based personnel and reduce the spread of the virus. Strict quarantine and testing protocols were implemented for personnel on, and visitors to, our vessels. We leveraged our IT infrastructure and various technology tools to enable our shore-based personnel to work seamlessly from home. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impede our ability to rotate crew members on and off our fleet of vessels in a timely and efficient manner due to changing immigration rules, mandatory quarantine requirements and limited air travel. Consequently, many of our seafarers remained onboard our vessels for longer than their contracted periods during 2020. We worked closely with all stakeholders during the year to reduce the number of affected seafarers and we continue our efforts to lobby for the welfare and rights of all seafarers. In January 2021, INSW signed the Neptune Declaration on Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew Change in a worldwide call to action to end the unprecedented crew change crisis caused by COVID-19. Developed by a taskforce of stakeholders from across the maritime value chain, the Neptune Declaration

International Seaways, Inc.



is a commitment signed by more than 300 companies and organizations to work together to ensure that the crew change crisis is resolved as soon as possible. It defines four main actions to facilitate crew changes and keep global supply chains functioning:
​

● | Recognize seafarers as key workers and give them priority access to COVID-19 vaccines;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establish and implement gold standard health protocols based on existing best practice;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase collaboration between ship operators and charterers to facilitate crew changes; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ensure air connectivity between key maritime hubs for seafarers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

​
COMPETITION
​
The shipping industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with other owners of International Flag tankers, including other independent shipowners, integrated oil companies, state-owned entities with their own fleets, and oil traders with logistical operations. Our vessels compete with all other vessels of a size and type required by the customer that can be available at the date and location specified. In the spot market, competition is based primarily on price, cargo quantity and cargo type, although charterers are selective with respect to the quality of the vessels they hire considering other key factors such as the reliability, quality and efficiency of operations and experience of crews. In the time charter market, factors such as the age and quality of the vessel and reputation of its owner and operator tend to be even more significant when competing for business.
​
Approximately 50% of our lightering activity is in the USG offshore lightering market. Our market share of the USG offshore lightering market was approximately 30% during 2020. We remain effectively one of three active full-service lightering businesses in the USG, the other two being AET Tankers Pte Ltd (or AET, a subsidiary of Malaysia International Shipping Corporation Berhad, or MISC) and Teekay Tankers Ltd. USG lightering trade has a steady foundation of demand due to traditional imports into the United States to serve U.S. Gulf Coast refinery demand. Although seaborne crude imports into the United States have declined in recent years, these lost imports have been offset by steadily increasing seaborne crude exports, largely from the USG area.  In the last three months of 2020, the EIA reported USG crude exports averaged 2.8 million b/d. VLCCs and Suezmaxes bound for Asia transport a large portion of these export barrels and they often require reverse lightering operations. Export lightering comprised approximately 75% of total volume lightered by our Crude Tankers Lightering business in the USG during 2020 and 2019.
​
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SECURITY MATTERS RELATING TO BULK SHIPPING
​
Government regulation significantly affects the operation of the Company’s vessels. INSW’s vessels operate in a heavily regulated environment and are subject to international conventions and international, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which such vessels operate or are registered.
​
The Company’s vessels undergo regular and rigorous safety inspections and audits which are conducted by the ships’ third-party managers. In addition, a variety of governmental and private entities subject the Company’s vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include USCG, local port state control authorities (harbor master or equivalent), coastal states, Classification Societies, flag state administration (country of registry) and customers, particularly major oil companies and petroleum terminal operators. Certain of these entities require INSW to obtain permits, licenses and certificates for the operation of the Company’s vessels. Failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals could require INSW to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend operation of one or more of the Company’s vessels.
​
The Company believes that the heightened level of environmental, health, safety and quality awareness among various stakeholders, including lenders, insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers, is leading to greater safety and other regulatory requirements and a more stringent inspection regime on all vessels. The Company is required to maintain operating standards for all of its vessels emphasizing operational safety and quality, environmental stewardship, preventive planned maintenance, continuous training of its officers and crews and compliance with international and U.S. regulations. INSW believes that the operation of its vessels is in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, because such laws and regulations are changed frequently, and new laws and regulations impose new or increasingly stringent requirements, INSW cannot predict the cost of complying with requirements beyond those that are currently in force. The impact of future regulatory requirements on operations or the resale value or useful lives of its vessels may result in substantial additional costs in meeting new legal and regulatory requirements. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Our Company — Risks relating to legal and regulatory matters, compliance with complex laws,

regulations and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect INSW’s business.”
​
International and U.S. Greenhouse Gas Regulations
​
In February 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (commonly called the Kyoto Protocol) became effective. Pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol, adopting countries are required to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, generally referred to as greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), which contribute to global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted by about 190 countries, commits its parties by setting internationally binding emission reduction targets. In December 2012, the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol was adopted to further extend the Kyoto Protocol’s GHG emissions reductions through 2020. In December 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change forged a new international framework (the “Paris Agreement”) that became effective in November 2016, after it had been ratified by a sufficient number of countries. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to be achieved by aiming to reach a global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible. To meet these objectives, the participating countries, acting individually or jointly, are to develop and implement successive “nationally determined contributions.” The countries will assess their collective programs toward achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement every five years beginning in 2023, referred to as the global stocktake, and subsequently are to update and enhance their actions on climate change. The Paris Agreement does not specifically require controls on shipping or other industries, but it is possible that countries or groups of countries will seek to impose such controls as they implement the Paris Agreement.
​
The IMO’s third study of GHG emissions from the global shipping fleet which concluded in 2014 predicted that, in the absence of appropriate policies, greenhouse emissions from ships may increase by 50% to 250% by 2050 due to expected growth in international seaborne trade. Methane emissions are projected to increase rapidly (albeit from a low base) as the share of LNG in the fuel mix increases. With respect to energy efficiency measures, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (“MEPC”) adopted guidelines on the Energy Efficiency Design Index (“EEDI”), which reflects the primary fuel for the calculation of the attained EEDI for ships having dual fuel engines using LNG and liquid fuel oil (see discussion below). The IMO is committed to developing limits on greenhouse gases from international shipping and is working on proposed mandatory technical and operational measures to achieve these limits. In April 2018, IMO adopted an initial strategy on the reduction of GHG emissions from ships, with the ultimate goal of eliminating GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible during this century. More specifically, under the identified “levels of ambition,” the initial strategy envisages the halt of the growth in GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and then the reduction of the total annual GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. In 2019, the IMO launched a project for an initial two-year period to initiate and promote global efforts to demonstrate and test technical solutions for reducing GHG emissions and improve energy efficiency throughout the maritime sector. 
​
In keeping with IMO’s initial strategy, IMO has committed to having in place by 2023 short-term measures and by 2030 mid-term measures intended to meet the stated goals of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from shipping by 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2050, and GHG emissions from shipping by 50% by 2050. To this end, IMO is in the process of crafting the 2023 measures and it is expected that these measures will include vessel design and efficient operation. The Company is monitoring the establishment of these measures and their potential impact.
​
In 2011, the European Commission established a working group on shipping to provide input to the European Commission in its work to develop and assess options for the inclusion of international maritime transport in the GHG reduction commitment of the European Union (“EU”). The Measure, Report and Verify (“MRV”) Regulation was adopted on April 29, 2015 and creates an EU-wide framework for the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from maritime transport. The MRV Regulation requires large ships (over 5,000 gross tons) calling at EU ports from January 1, 2018, to collect and later publish verified annual data on carbon dioxide emissions. IMO has developed similar MRV regulations that became effective on March 1, 2018 and the first reporting period is for the full year 2019. In 2020, the EU announced the inclusion of shipping in their established Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”). The EU has indicated that the target date for the including of shipping is 2022. At this time, there are few details of how shipping will be included, what impact this will have on domestic or foreign trading vessels, and what the potential economic impacts will be.
​
In the United States, pursuant to an April 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) was required to consider whether carbon dioxide should be considered a pollutant that endangers public health and welfare, and thus subject to regulation under the U.S. Clean Air Act. On December 1, 2009, the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” regarding 

10
International Seaways, Inc.



GHGs under the Clean Air Act. This finding in itself does not impose any requirements on industry or other entities. Although the EPA has promulgated certain regulations relating to GHG emissions, to date the regulations proposed and enacted by the EPA have not involved ocean-going vessels.
​
Future passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, EU, United States or other countries where INSW operates that restrict emissions of GHGs could require significant additional capital and/or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on INSW’s business. Although we cannot predict such expenditures and impacts with certainty at this time, they may be material to INSW’s results of operations.
​
International Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards
​
Liability Standards and Limits
​
Many countries have ratified and follow the liability plan adopted by the IMO and set out in the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 (the "1969 Convention"). Some of these countries have also adopted the 1992 Protocol to the 1969 Convention (the "1992 Protocol"). Under both the 1969 Convention and the 1992 Protocol, a vessel's registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territory, including the territorial waters (and in the exclusive economic zone under the 1992 Protocol) of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain complete defenses. Both instruments apply to all seagoing vessels carrying oil in bulk as cargo. These instruments also limit the liability of the shipowner under certain circumstances. As these instruments calculate liability in terms of a basket of currencies, the figures in this section are converted into U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates on December 31, 2020 and are approximate. Actual dollar amounts are used in this section “-Liability Standards and Limits” and in “-U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards-Liability Standards and Limits” below.
​
Under the 1969 Convention, except where the pollution damage resulted from the actual fault or privity of the owner, its liability is limited to $193 per ton of the vessel’s tonnage, with a maximum liability of $20.3 million. Under the 1992 Protocol, the liability of the owner is limited to $4.3 million for a ship not exceeding 5,000 units of tonnage (a unit of measurement for the total enclosed spaces within a vessel) and $608 per gross ton thereafter, with a maximum liability of $86.5 million. Under the 1992 Protocol, the owner's liability is limited except where the pollution damage results from its personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result. Under the 2000 amendments to the 1992 Protocol, which became effective on November 1, 2003, liability is limited to $6.5 million plus $914 for each additional gross ton over 5,000 for vessels of 5,000 to 140,000 gross tons, and $130.1 million for vessels over 140,000 gross tons, subject to the exceptions discussed above for the 1992 Protocol.
​
Vessels trading to states that are parties to these instruments must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner. The Company believes that its P&I insurance will cover any liability under the plan adopted by the IMO. See the discussion of insurance in “U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards-Liability Standards and Limits” below.
​
The United States is not a party to the 1969 Convention or the 1992 Protocol. See “U.S. Environmental and Safety Restrictions and Regulations” below. In other jurisdictions where the 1969 Convention has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to that convention.
​
The International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001, which was adopted on March 23, 2001 and became effective on November 21, 2008, is a separate convention adopted to ensure that adequate, prompt and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil when used as fuel by vessels. The convention applies to damage caused to the territory, including the territorial sea, and exclusive economic zones, of states that are party to it. Vessels operating internationally are subject to it, if sailing within the territories of those countries that have implemented its provisions (which does not include the United States). Key features of this convention are compulsory insurance or other financial security for vessels over 1,000 gross tons to cover the liability of the registered owner for pollution damage and direct action against the insurer. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
​
Other International Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards
​
Under the ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO, vessel operators are required to develop a safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy describing how the objectives of a functional safety 

11
International Seaways, Inc.



management system will be met. The third party managers of INSW’s vessels, have safety management systems for the Company’s fleet, with instructions and procedures for the safe operation of its vessels, reporting accidents and non-conformities, internal audits and management reviews and responding to emergencies, as well as defined levels of responsibility. The ISM Code requires a Document of Compliance (“DoC”) to be obtained for the company responsible for operating the vessel and a Safety Management Certificate (“SMC”) to be obtained for each vessel that such company operates. Once issued, these certificates are valid for a maximum of five years. The company operating the vessel in turn must undergo an annual internal audit and an external verification audit in order to maintain the DoC. In accordance with the ISM Code, each vessel must also undergo an annual internal audit at intervals not to exceed twelve months and vessels must undergo an external verification audit twice in a five-year period. The Company’s third party managers have a DoC for their offices.
​
The SMC is issued after verifying that the company responsible for operating the vessel and its shipboard management operate in accordance with the approved safety management system. No vessel can obtain a certificate unless its operator has been awarded a DoC issued by the administration of that vessel’s flag state or as otherwise permitted under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended (“SOLAS”).
​
IMO regulations also require owners and operators of vessels to adopt Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (“SOPEPs”). Periodic training and drills for response personnel and for vessels and their crews are required. In addition to SOPEPs, INSW has adopted Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plans, which cover potential releases not only of oil but of any noxious liquid substances. Noncompliance with the ISM Code and other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner or charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. For example, the USCG and EU authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code will be prohibited from trading to United States and EU ports.
​
The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (“BWM Convention”) is designed to protect the marine environment from the introduction of non-native (alien) species as a result of the carrying of ships’ ballast water from one place to another. The introduction of non-native species has been identified as one of the top five threats to biological diversity. Expanding seaborne trade and traffic have exacerbated the threat. Tankers must take on ballast water in order to maintain their stability and draft and must discharge the ballast water when they load their next cargo. When emptying the ballast water, which they carried from the previous port, they may release organisms and pathogens that have been identified as being potentially harmful in the new environment.
​
The BWM Convention was adopted in 2004 and became effective on September 8, 2017. The BWM Convention is applicable to new and existing vessels that are designed to carry ballast water. It defines a discharge standard consisting of maximum allowable levels of critical invasive species. This standard is met by installing treatment systems that render the invasive species non-viable. In addition, each vessel is required to have on board a valid International Ballast Water Management Certificate, a Ballast Water Management Plan and a Ballast Water Record Book.
​
INSW’s vessels are subject to other international, national and local ballast water management regulations (including those described below under “U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards”). INSW complies with these regulations through ballast water management plans implemented on each of the vessels in its fleet. To meet existing and anticipated ballast water treatment requirements, including those contained in the BWM Convention, INSW has a fleetwide action plan to comply with IMO, EPA, USCG and possibly more stringent U.S. state mandates as they are implemented and become effective, which may require the installation and use of costly control technologies. Compliance with the ballast water requirements effective under the BWM Convention and other regulations may have material impacts on INSW’s operations and financial results, as discussed below under “U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards-Other U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards.”
​
Other EU Legislation and Regulations
​
The EU has adopted legislation that: (1) bans manifestly sub-standard vessels (defined as those over 15 years old that have been detained by port authorities at least twice in the course of the preceding 24 months) from European waters, creates an obligation for port states to inspect at least 25% of vessels using their ports annually and provides for increased surveillance of vessels posing a high risk to maritime safety or the marine environment, and (2) provides the EU with greater authority and control over Classification Societies, including the ability to seek to suspend or revoke the authority of negligent societies. INSW believes that none of its vessels meet the definitions of a "sub-standard" vessel contained in the EU legislation. EU directives enacted in 2005 and amended in 2009 require EU member states to introduce criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances (e.g., from tank 

12
International Seaways, Inc.



cleaning operations) which result in deterioration in the quality of water and has been committed with intent, recklessness or serious negligence. Certain member states of the EU, by virtue of their national legislation, already impose criminal sanctions for pollution events under certain circumstances. The Company cannot predict what additional legislation or regulations, if any, may be promulgated by the EU or any other country or authority, or how these might impact INSW.
​
International Air Emission Standards
​
Annex VI to MARPOL (“Annex VI”), which was designed to address air pollution from vessels and which became effective internationally on May 19, 2005, sets limits on sulfur oxide (“SOx”) and nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. Annex VI also regulated shipboard incineration and the emission of volatile organic compounds from tankers. Annex VI was amended in 2008 to provide for a progressive and substantial reduction in SOx and NOx emissions from vessels and allow for the designation of Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”) in which more stringent controls would apply. The primary changes were that the global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil was reduced to 3.50% from 4.50% effective from January 1, 2012, and such cap was further reduced to 0.50% effective from January 1, 2020. Further, the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in designated ECAs was progressively reduced from 1.5% to 1.0% effective July 2010 and further reduced to 0.1% effective January 2015. Currently designated ECAs are: the Baltic Sea area, the North Sea area, the North American area (covering designated coastal areas off the United States and Canada) and the United States Caribbean Sea area (around Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands). For vessels over 400 gross tons, Annex VI imposes various survey and certification requirements. The U.S. Maritime Pollution Prevention Act of 2008 amended the U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to provide for the adoption of Annex VI. In October 2008, the U.S. ratified Annex VI, which came into force in the United States on January 8, 2009.
​
In addition to Annex VI, there are regional mandates in ports and certain territorial waters within the EU, Turkey, China and Norway, for example, regarding reduced SOx emissions. These requirements establish maximum allowable limits for sulfur content in fuel oils used by vessels when operating within certain areas and waters and while “at berth.” In December 2012, an EU directive that aligned the EU requirements with Annex VI entered into force. For vessels at berth in EU ports, sulfur content of fuel oil is limited to 0.1%. For vessels operating in SOx Emission Control Areas (“SECAs”), sulfur content of fuel oil is limited to 0.1% as of January 1, 2015. For vessels operating outside SECAs, sulfur content of fuel oil is limited to 0.5% as of January 1, 2020. Alternatively, emission abatement methods are permitted as long as they continuously achieve reductions of SOx emissions that are at least equivalent to those obtained using compliant marine fuels.
​
More stringent Tier III emission limits are applicable to engines installed on a ship constructed on or after January 1, 2016 operating in ECAs. NOx emission Tier III standards came into force on January 1, 2016 in ECAs.
​
Additional air emission requirements under Annex VI became effective on July 1, 2010 mandating the development of Volatile Organic Compound (“VOC”) Management Plans for tank vessels and certain gas ships.
​
The Company believes that its vessels are compliant with the current requirements of Annex VI and that those of its vessels that operate in the EU, Turkey, China, Norway and elsewhere are also compliant with the regional mandates applicable there. However, the Company anticipates that, in the next several years, compliance with the increasingly stringent requirements of Annex VI and other conventions, laws and regulations imposing air emission standards that have already been adopted or that may be adopted will require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on INSW’s business. Although INSW cannot predict such expenditures and impacts with certainty at this time, they may be material to INSW’s financial statements.
​
SOLAS
​
From January 1, 2014, various amendments to the SOLAS conventions came into force, including an amendment to Chapter VI of SOLAS, which prohibits the blending of bulk liquid cargoes during sea passage and the production process on board ships. This prohibition does not preclude the master of the vessel from undertaking cargo transfers for the safety of the ship or protection of the marine environment.
​
MARPOL
​
Effective March 1, 2018, pursuant to an amendment to MARPOL Annex V, shippers are required to determine whether or not their cargo is hazardous and classify it in line with the criteria of the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification. 

13
International Seaways, Inc.



Vessels are required to maintain a new format garbage record book, which is divided into two parts: cargo residues and garbage other than cargo residues. The cargo residues part must be further divided into hazardous and non-hazardous to the marine environment cargo. More stringent discharge requirements apply to hazardous cargo residues.
​
U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards
​
The United States regulates the shipping industry with an extensive regulatory and liability regime for environmental protection and cleanup of oil spills, consisting primarily of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”), and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). OPA 90 affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade with the United States or its territories or possessions, or whose vessels operate in the waters of the United States, which include the U.S. territorial sea and the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone around the United States. CERCLA applies to the discharge of hazardous substances (other than oil) whether on land or at sea. Both OPA 90 and CERCLA impact the Company’s operations.
​
Liability Standards and Limits
​
Under OPA 90, vessel owners, operators and bareboat or demise charterers are "responsible parties" who are liable, without regard to fault, for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages, including property and natural resource damages and economic loss without physical damage to property, arising from oil spills and pollution from their vessels. Currently, the limits of OPA 90 liability with respect to (i) tanker vessels with a qualifying double hull are the greater of $2,300 per gross ton or approximately $19.9 million per vessel that is over 3,000 gross tons; and (ii) non-tanker vessels, the greater of $1,200 per gross ton or approximately $1.0 million per vessel. The statute specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters. In some cases, states that have enacted this type of legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners’ responsibilities under these laws. CERCLA, which applies to owners and operators of vessels, contains a similar liability regime and provides for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages associated with discharges of hazardous substances (other than oil). Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million.
​
These limits of liability do not apply, however, where the incident is caused by violation of applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulations, or by the responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, these limits do not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident or to cooperate and assist in connection with the substance removal activities. OPA 90 and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law.
OPA 90 also requires owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the limit of their potential strict liability under the statute. The USCG enacted regulations requiring evidence of financial responsibility consistent with the previous limits of liability described above for OPA 90 and CERCLA. Under the regulations, evidence of financial responsibility may be demonstrated by insurance, surety bond, self-insurance, guaranty or an alternative method subject to approval by the Director of the USCG National Pollution Funds Center. Under OPA 90 regulations, an owner or operator of more than one vessel is required to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility for the entire fleet in an amount equal only to the financial responsibility requirement of the vessel having the greatest maximum strict liability under OPA 90 and CERCLA. INSW has provided the requisite guarantees and has received certificates of financial responsibility from the USCG for each of its vessels required to have one.
​
INSW has insurance for each of its vessels with pollution liability insurance in the amount of $1 billion. However, a catastrophic spill could exceed the insurance coverage available, in which event there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the U.S. Congress proposed legislation to create more stringent requirements related to the prevention and response to oil spills in U.S. waters and to increase both financial responsibility requirements and the limits in liability under OPA 90, although Congress has not yet enacted any such legislation. In addition to potential liability under OPA 90, vessel owners may in some instances incur liability on an even more stringent basis under state law in the particular state where the spillage occurred.
​
On September 24, 2020, the State of California announced changes to California’s Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act to be made effective on January 1, 2021. These changes include raising the California State certificate of financial responsibility (COFR) from $1 billion to $2 billion and increasing the extent of certain criminal fines in the event of an oil spill.

Other U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards
​
OPA 90 also amended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require owners and operators of vessels to adopt vessel response plans, including marine salvage and firefighting plans, for reporting and responding to vessel emergencies and oil spill scenarios up to a "worst case" scenario and to identify and ensure, through contracts or other approved means, the availability of necessary private response resources to respond to a “worst case discharge.” The plans must include contractual commitments with clean-up response contractors and salvage and marine firefighters in order to ensure an immediate response to an oil spill/vessel emergency. Each vessel has an USCG approved plan on file with the USCG and onboard the vessel. These plans are regularly reviewed and updated.
OPA 90 requires training programs and periodic drills for shore-side staff and response personnel and for vessels and their crews. INSW’s third party technical managers conduct such required training programs and periodic drills.
​
OPA 90 does not prevent individual U.S. states from imposing their own liability regimes with respect to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. In fact, most U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws are in some cases more stringent than U.S. federal law.
​
In addition, the U.S. Clean Water Act (“CWA”) prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances in U.S. navigable waters and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under the more recent OPA 90 and CERCLA, discussed above.
​
At the federal level in the United States, ballast water management is subject to two separate, partially interrelated regulatory regimes. One is administered by the USCG under the National Aquatic Nuisance and Control Act and National Invasive Species Act, and the other is administered by the EPA under the CWA.
​
In March 2012, the USCG promulgated its final rule on ballast water management for the control of nonindigenous species in U.S. waters. While generally in line with the requirements set out in the BWM Convention, the final rule requires that treatment systems for domestic and foreign vessels operating in U.S. waters must be Type Approved by the USCG. The USCG first approved a treatment system as Type Approved in December 2016, and accordingly before such date the USCG had a policy to issue temporary extensions of the compliance dates for the implementation of approved treatment systems. INSW has obtained extensions from the USCG of the treatment system requirement and its first compliance date for any of its vessels was in 2018. INSW expects that its vessels discharging ballast in U.S. waters will have Type Approved treatment systems by their extended compliance dates.
​
The discharge of ballast water and other substances incidental to the normal operation of vessels in U.S. ports also is subject to CWA permitting requirements. In accordance with the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, the Company is subject to a Vessel General Permit (“VGP”), which addresses, among other matters, the discharge of ballast water and effluents. The current VGP, which was issued in 2013, identifies twenty-six vessel discharge streams and establishes numeric ballast water discharge limits that generally align with the treatment technologies to be implemented under USCG’s 2012 final rule, requirements to ensure that the ballast water treatment systems are functioning correctly, and more stringent effluent limits for oil to sea interfaces and exhaust gas scrubber wastewater. The VGP contains a compliance date schedule for these requirements. The VGP standards and requirements were due for modification and renewal in December 2018, but this renewal has been postponed by the EPA with no fixed date for completion. Until a new VGP program is implemented, the current standards remain in effect.
​
Certain of the Company’s vessels are subject to more stringent numeric discharge limits under the EPA’s VGP, even though those vessels have obtained a valid extension from the USCG for implementation of treatment technology under its 2012 final rule. The EPA has determined that it will not issue extensions under the VGP, but in December 2013 it issued an Enforcement Response Policy (“ERP”) to address this industry-wide issue. Under the ERP, the EPA states that vessels that have received an extension from the USCG, are in compliance with all of the VGP’s requirements other than the numeric discharge limits and meet certain other requirements will be entitled to a “low enforcement priority.” While INSW believes that any vessel that is or may become subject to the VGP’s numeric discharge limits during the pendency of a USCG extension will be entitled to such low priority treatment under the ERP no assurance can be given that they will do so.
​
The VGP system also permits individual states and territories to impose more stringent requirements for discharges into the navigable waters of such state or territory. Certain individual states have enacted legislation or regulations addressing hull cleaning and ballast water management. For example, on October 10, 2007, California enacted Assembly Bill 740, legislation expanding regulation of 

15
International Seaways, Inc.



ballast water discharges and the management of hull-fouling organisms. California has extensive requirements for more stringent effluent limits and discharge monitoring and testing requirements with respect to discharges in its waters. Due to delays by manufacturers in developing ballast water treatment systems that are able to comply with these effluent limits and in creating equipment to reliably test such compliance, the compliance date for all vessels making ballast water discharges in California waters has been deferred to the first scheduled drydocking after January 1, 2020. INSW’s vessels and systems are currently in compliance with the applicable California discharge standards.
​
Following an assessment by the California State Lands Commission of the current technology for meeting ballast water management standards, California adopted legislation (Assembly Bill 912) effective January 1, 2020 that extended the deadline for compliance for interim standards to 2030 and the deadline for final “zero detect” standards to 2040. 
​
New York State has imposed a more stringent bilge water discharge requirement for vessels in its waters than what is required by the VGP or IMO. Through its Section 401 Certification of the VGP, New York prohibits the discharge of all bilge water in its waters. New York State also requires that vessels entering its waters from outside the Exclusive Economic Zone must perform ballast water exchange in addition to treating it with a ballast water treatment system.
​
On December 4, 2018, the USCG Authorization Act of 2018 was enacted, which included the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”). Under VIDA, the EPA was designated the government agency responsible for establishing standards for U.S. ballast water regulations and the USCG was assigned the responsibility for monitoring and enforcing those standards. VIDA reduces the scope of the VGP and is expected to align state and local discharge standards with federal standards. Ultimately, under VIDA, the discharge of ballast water in the navigable waters of the United States will no longer subject to the VGP or the CWA. In October 2020, EPA issued its proposed national standards of performance for 20 separate discharges incidental to normal vessel operations including ballast tanks and exhaust gas emission control systems, and it plans to issue a final rule after considering public comment. The Company plans to continue to monitor the implementation of VIDA at the federal, state, and local levels.
​
The Company anticipates that, in the next several years, compliance with the various conventions, laws and regulations relating to ballast water management that have already been adopted or that may be adopted in the future will require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures and could have operational impacts on INSW’s business. Although INSW cannot predict such expenditures and impacts with certainty at this time, they may be material to INSW’s financial statements.
​
U.S. Air Emissions Standards
​
As discussed above, MARPOL Annex VI came into force in the United States in January 2009. In April 2010, EPA adopted regulations implementing the provisions of Annex VI. Under these regulations, vessels subject to the engine and fuel standards of Annex VI must comply with the applicable Annex VI provisions when they enter U.S. ports or operate in most internal U.S. waters. The Company’s vessels are currently Annex VI compliant. Accordingly, absent any new and onerous Annex VI implementing regulations, the Company does not expect to incur material additional costs in order to comply with this convention.
​
The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and 1990 (“CAA”), requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. INSW’s vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas. Each of the Company’s vessels operating in the transport of clean petroleum products in regulated port areas where vapor control standards are required has been outfitted with a vapor recovery system that satisfies these requirements. In addition, the EPA issued emissions standards for marine diesel engines. The EPA has implemented rules comparable to those of Annex VI to increase the control of air pollutant emissions from certain large marine engines by requiring certain new marine-diesel engines installed on U.S. registered ships to meet lower NOx standards which will be implemented in two phases. The newly built engine standards that became effective in 2011 require more efficient use of current engine technologies, including engine timing, engine cooling, and advanced computer controls to achieve a 15 to 25 percent NOx reduction below previous levels. The new long-term standards for newly built engines apply beginning in 2016 and require the use of high efficiency emission control technology such as selective catalytic reduction to achieve NOx reductions 80 percent below the pre-2016 levels. The North American ECA, encompassing the area extending 200 miles from the coastlines of the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts and the eight main Hawaiian Islands, became effective on August 1, 2012, and the United States Caribbean Sea ECA, encompassing water around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, became effective on January 1, 2014. Fuel used by all vessels operating in the ECA cannot exceed 0.1% sulfur, effective January 1, 2015. The Company believes that its vessels are in compliance with the current requirements of the ECAs. From 2016, NOx after-treatment requirements also apply. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO or other new or more stringent 

16
International Seaways, Inc.



requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the EPA or the states where INSW operates, compliance could require or affect the timing of significant capital and/or operating expenditures that could be material to INSW’s consolidated financial statements.
​
The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”), designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in major metropolitan and industrial areas. Where states fail to present approvable SIPs, or SIP revisions by certain statutory deadlines, the EPA is required to draft a Federal Implementation Plan. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from barge loading and degassing operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. Where required, the Company’s vessels are already equipped with vapor control systems that satisfy these requirements. Although a risk exists that new regulations could require significant capital expenditures and otherwise increase its costs, the Company believes, based upon the regulations that have been proposed to date, that no material capital expenditures beyond those currently contemplated and no material increase in costs are likely to be required as a result of the SIPs program.
​
Individual states have been considering their own restrictions on air emissions from engines on vessels operating within state waters. California requires certain ocean-going vessels operating within 24 nautical miles of the Californian coast to reduce air pollution by using only low-sulfur marine distillate fuel rather than bunker fuel in auxiliary diesel and diesel-electric engines, main propulsion diesel engines and auxiliary boilers. Vessels sailing within 24 miles of the California coastline whose itineraries call for them to enter any California ports, terminal facilities, or internal or estuarine waters must use marine gas oil or marine diesel oil with a sulfur content at or below 0.1% sulfur. The Company believes that its vessels that operate in California waters are in compliance with these regulations.
​
In August 2020, the California Air Resources Board announced changes to existing emissions requirements. These changes will require that ships at berths in California ports operate with zero emissions. These changes become effective in 2025 and 2027, depending on the ship type and port. The impact of these changes is not known at this time.
Security Regulations and Practices
​
Security at sea has been a concern to governments, shipping lines, port authorities and importers and exporters for years. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security. In 2002, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) came into effect and the USCG issued regulations in 2003 implementing certain portions of the MTSA by requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, in December 2002, a coalition of 150 IMO contracting states drafted amendments to SOLAS by creating a new subchapter dealing specifically with maritime security. This new subchapter, which became effective in July 2004, imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, most of which are contained in the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (the “ISPS Code”). The ISPS Code is applicable to all cargo vessels of 500 gross tons plus all passenger ships operating on international voyages, mobile offshore drilling units, as well as port facilities that service them. The objective of the ISPS Code is to establish the framework that allows detection of security threats and implementation of preventive measures against security incidents that can affect ships or port facilities used in international trade. Among other things, the ISPS Code requires the development of vessel security plans and compliance with flag state security certification requirements. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (“ISSC”) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state.
​
The USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt from MTSA vessel security measures for non-U.S. vessels that have on board a valid ISSC attesting to the vessel’s compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code.
​
All of INSW’s vessels have developed and implemented vessel security plans that have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, have obtained ISSCs and comply with applicable security requirements.
​
The Company monitors the waters in which its vessels operate for pirate activity. Company vessels that transit areas where there is a high risk of pirate activity follow best management practices for reducing risk and preventing pirate attacks and are in compliance with protocols established by the naval coalition protective forces operating in such areas.

INSPECTION BY CLASSIFICATION SOCIETIES
​
Every oceangoing vessel must be “classed” by a Classification Society. The Classification Society certifies that the vessel is “in class,” signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the Classification Society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the Classification Society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. The Classification Society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.
For maintenance of the class certification, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classed are required to be performed as follows:
​

● | Annual Surveys. For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant and where applicable for special equipment classed, at intervals of 12 months from the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Intermediate Surveys. Extended annual surveys are referred to as intermediate surveys and typically are conducted two and one-half years after commissioning and each class renewal. Intermediate surveys may be carried out between the occasions of the second or third annual survey.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class Renewal Surveys. Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship’s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and for any special equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. At the special survey the vessel is thoroughly examined, including ultrasonic measurements to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the Classification Society would prescribe steel renewals. The Classification Society may grant a one-year grace period for completion of the special survey. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every four or five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a shipowner has the option of arranging with the Classification Society for the vessel’s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five-year cycle. Upon a shipowner’s request, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class survey period. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vessels are required to dry dock for inspection of the underwater hull at each intermediate survey and at each class renewal survey. For tankers less than 15 years old, Classification Societies permit for intermediate surveys in water inspections by divers in lieu of dry docking, subject to other requirements of such Classification Societies.
​
If defects are found during any survey, the Classification Society surveyor will issue a “recommendation” which must be rectified by the vessel owner within prescribed time limits.
​
Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as “in class” by a Classification Society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies, or IACS. In December 2013, IACS adopted new harmonized Common Structure Rules, which apply to crude oil tankers and dry bulk carriers to be constructed on or after July 1, 2015. All our vessels are currently, and we expect will continue to be, certified as being “in class” by a Classification Society that is a member of IACS. All new and secondhand vessels that we acquire must be certified as being “in class” prior to their delivery under our standard purchase contracts and memorandum of agreement. If the vessel is not certified on the date of closing, we have no obligation to take delivery of the vessel.
​
INSURANCE
​
Consistent with the currently prevailing practice in the industry, the Company presently carries protection and indemnity (“P&I”) insurance coverage for pollution of $1.0 billion per occurrence on every vessel in its fleet. P&I insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations (“P&I Associations”). The P&I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s liabilities. Each P&I Association has capped its exposure to each of its members at approximately $8.2 billion. As a member of a P&I Association that is a member of the International Group, the Company is subject to calls payable to the P&I Associations based on its 

18
International Seaways, Inc.



claim record as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual Associations of which it is a member, and the members of the pool of P&I Associations comprising the International Group. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was a member of three P&I Associations. Each of the Company’s vessels is insured by one of these three Associations with deductibles ranging from $0.025 million to $0.1 million per vessel per incident. While the Company has historically been able to obtain pollution coverage at commercially reasonable rates, no assurances can be given that such insurance will continue to be available in the future.
​
The Company carries marine hull and machinery and war risk (including piracy) insurance, which includes the risk of actual or constructive total loss, for all of its vessels. The vessels are each covered up to at least their fair market value, with deductibles ranging from $0.125 million to $0.50 million per vessel per incident. The Company is self-insured for hull and machinery claims in amounts in excess of the individual vessel deductibles up to a maximum aggregate loss of $1.5 million per policy year for its vessels.
​
The Company currently maintains loss of hire insurance to cover loss of charter income resulting from accidents or breakdowns of its vessels, and the bareboat chartered vessels that are covered under the vessels’ marine hull and machinery insurance. Loss of hire insurance covers up to 120 days lost charter income per vessel per incident in excess of the first 21 or 60 days (which depends on the particular vessel covered) lost for each covered incident, which is borne by the Company.
​
TAXATION OF THE COMPANY
​
INSW is incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and pursuant to the laws of the Marshall Islands, the Company is not subject to income tax in the Marshall Islands.
​
The following summary of the principal U.S. tax laws applicable to the Company, as well as the conclusions regarding certain issues of tax law, are based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), existing and proposed U.S. Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, pronouncements and judicial decisions, all as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. No assurance can be given that changes in or interpretation of existing laws will not occur or will not be retroactive or that anticipated future circumstances will in fact occur.
​
All of the Company’s vessels are owned or operated by foreign corporations that are subsidiaries of INSW.
​
Taxation of INSW on its Shipping Income
​
INSW derives substantially all of its gross income from the use and operation of vessels in international commerce. This income principally consists of hire from time and voyage charters for the transportation of cargoes and the performance of services directly related thereto, which is referred to herein as “shipping income.”
​
In 2020 and prior years, INSW was exempt from taxation on its U.S. source shipping income under Section 883 of the Code and Treasury regulations. For 2021 and future years, INSW will need to evaluate its qualification for exemption under Section 883 and there can be no assurance that INSW will continue to qualify for the exemption. Our qualification for the exemption under Section 883 is described in more detail under “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters —  We may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on U.S. source shipping income, which would reduce our net income and cash flows.” To the extent INSW is unable to qualify for exemption from tax under Section 883, INSW will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation of 4% of its U.S. source shipping income on a gross basis without the benefit of deductions.
​
Shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the United States will be considered to be 50% derived from sources within the United States. Shipping income attributable to transportation that both begins and ends in the U.S. will be considered to be 100% derived from sources within the United States. INSW does not engage in transportation that gives rise to 100% U.S. source income. Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-U.S. ports will be considered to be 100% derived from sources outside the United States and will generally not be subject to any U.S. federal income tax. INSW’s vessels operate in various parts of the world, including to or from U.S. ports.
