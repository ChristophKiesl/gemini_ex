ITEM 1. Business
Torotel, Inc. ("Torotel") conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Torotel Products, Inc. ("Torotel Products"). Torotel was incorporated under the laws of the State of Missouri in 1956. Torotel's offices are located at 520 North Rogers Road, Olathe, Kansas 66062. Torotel maintains a website at www.torotelinc.com. In addition, Torotel Products maintains a website at www.torotelproducts.com. Information contained on or accessible through either such website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K. Our telephone number is (913) 747-6111. The terms "we," "us," "our," and the "Company" as used herein include Torotel and Torotel Products, unless the context otherwise requires.
Torotel specializes in the custom design and manufacture of a wide variety of precision magnetic components, consisting of transformers, inductors, reactors, chokes, toroidal coils, high voltage transformers, dry-type transformers, and electro-mechanical assemblies. Torotel sells these products to original equipment manufacturers, which use them in products such as aircraft navigational equipment, digital control devices, medical equipment, avionics equipment, down-hole drilling, conventional missile guidance systems, and other defense and commercial aerospace applications.
Torotel provides end products to the defense industry and is considered part of the Defense Industrial Base (“DIB”). The DIB is identified as a Critical Infrastructure Sector by the Department of Homeland Security and is defined as the worldwide industrial complex that enables research and development as well as design, production, delivery, and maintenance of military weapons systems/software systems, subsystems, and components or parts, as well as purchased services to meet U.S. Military requirements. Based on this identification, and guidance from the “Memorandum for Defense Industrial Base” dated March 20, 2020, Torotel is considered an essential business by the Department of Defense during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following discussion includes the business operations of Torotel as of and for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020 (“fiscal year 2020”).
Principal Products
Torotel specializes in the custom design and manufacture of a wide variety of precision magnetic components, and electro-mechanical assemblies for use in military, commercial aerospace and industrial electronic applications. These products are used to modify and control electrical voltages and currents in electronic devices. For example, if equipment containing one of these components receives an electrical voltage or current which is too high, the component would modify and control the electrical voltage or current to allow proper operation of the equipment. While Torotel primarily manufactures these products in accordance with pre-developed mechanical and electrical requirements, in some cases Torotel will be responsible for both the overall design and manufacturing. These products are sold to manufacturers who incorporate them into an end-product. The major applications include aircraft navigational equipment, digital control devices, medical equipment, avionics systems, down-hole drilling, conventional missile guidance systems, and other defense related applications. Torotel has a line of 400 Hz miniature power transformers listed on the Qualified Products List ("QPL") of the Department of Defense ("DoD"), which requires re-qualification with the DoD every five years. Sales of the QPL products represented approximately 2% of the net sales of Torotel for fiscal year 2020.
Marketing and Customers
Torotel’s sales do not represent a significant portion of any particular market in which it provides its products. While approximately 42% of annual sales in fiscal year 2020 came from select commercial markets, such as commercial aerospace, and oil drilling, historically Torotel has primarily focused its activities on the defense industry. As a result, the business of Torotel is subject to various risks including, without limitation, dependence on government appropriations and program allocations, potential cutbacks in military spending, the requirement that some of our products be approved and qualified by the federal government before we can sell them, and the competition for available military business. Torotel pursues revenue opportunities in electro-mechanical assemblies, in larger and higher voltage transformers, along with products sourced from low-cost manufacturers in overseas markets who are compliant with aerospace standards.
Torotel markets its products primarily through an internal sales force and independent manufacturers' representatives paid on a commission basis. These commissions are earned when a product is sold and/or shipped to a

customer within the representative's assigned territory. Torotel also utilizes its engineering department in its direct sales efforts for the purpose of expanding its reach into new markets and/or customers. Other sales methods may include visits to customers, lunch-and-learn presentations to customers' engineers, catalog brochures, trade show exhibits and speaker presentations at trade shows.
Torotel is an approved source for magnetic components used in numerous military and commercial aerospace systems, which means Torotel is automatically solicited for any procurement needs for such applications. The magnetic components manufactured by Torotel are sold primarily in the United States, and most sales are awarded on a competitive bid basis.
Torotel currently has a primary base of approximately 10 customers that together provide 95% of its annual sales volume. This customer base includes many large prime defense and commercial aerospace companies. Torotel’s primary strategy focuses on providing superior service to this core group of customers, including engineering support and new product design. The objective is to achieve growth with these customers or other targeted companies that possess the potential for inclusion into this core group. During fiscal year 2020, sales to a single customer accounted for 31%, and sales to another customer accounted for 28% of the net sales of Torotel. A loss of, or material reduction in orders from, these customers could have a material adverse effect on sales.
Competition
The markets in which Torotel competes are highly competitive. A substantial number of companies utilizing similar resources sell components and assemblies of the type manufactured and sold by Torotel. In addition, Torotel sells to a number of customers who have the capability of manufacturing their own electronic components.
The principal methods of competition for electronic products in the markets served by Torotel include, among other factors, price, on-time delivery performance, lead times, customized product engineering and technical support, marketing capabilities, quality assurance, manufacturing efficiency, and existing relationships with customers' engineers. While it is believed that magnetic components are not susceptible to rapid technological change, Torotel’s sales, which do not represent a significant share of the industry's market, are susceptible to decline given the competitive nature of the market.
Manufacturing
Nearly all of Torotel’s sales consist of electronic products manufactured to customers' specifications. Aside from contractually required finished goods buffers, only a limited amount of finished goods is maintained in our inventory. Although special wire-winding machines and molding machines are used in the production process, the various electronic products are manually assembled, with numerous employees and some subcontractors contributing to the completion of the products.
Essential materials used by Torotel in the manufacturing process include magnetic materials, copper wire, plastic housings and epoxies. We believe these materials are available from many sources. Major suppliers include MK Magnetics, Magnetic Metals-Western Division, EIS, Inc., Parkway Products, API Technologies Corporation, Krayden Inc., and Exxelia Dearborn, Inc. Special contact plates purchased from Fotofab, LLC and polycarbonate materials purchased from Florida Custom Mold and Spectrum Plastics are used in manufacturing the potted coil assembly. Fotofab, Florida Custom Mold, and Spectrum Plastics are the only qualified approved sources for the materials they provide. As a result, Torotel maintains contingent business interruption insurance on these three suppliers' facilities, as well as the customers' production facility, to insure against loss of business income associated with a disruption in production by either supplier or at the customer as a result of a fire, tornado, explosion or other similar type loss.
Torotel has not experienced any significant curtailment of production because of material shortages, but any long lead times or high dollar minimum orders could have an adverse impact on sales bookings. Torotel does not experience seasonal variations in its business.
Governmental Regulations
A significant portion of Torotel’s business is derived from subcontracts with prime contractors of the U.S. government. As a U.S. subcontractor, Torotel is subject to federal contracting regulations. These subcontracts may be terminated at any time at the convenience of the U.S. government. Upon such termination, adequate financial compensation

is usually provided in such instances to protect Torotel from suffering a loss on a subcontract. These subcontracts also may be terminated for default for failure to perform a material obligation. In the event of a termination for default, the customer may have the unilateral right at any time to require Torotel to pay the excess, if any, of the cost of purchasing a substitute item from a third party. If the customer has suffered other ascertainable damages as a result of a sustained default, the customer could demand payment of such damages. Torotel has never experienced any terminations for default.
As a supplier of products for military applications, Torotel must comply with laws concerning the export of material used exclusively for military purposes. The export of those types of materials is covered under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR") and the Arms Export Control Act ("AECA"). Torotel is licensed with the U.S. Department of State making it eligible to provide defense-related components pursuant to ITAR and AECA. This license is renewed annually each October.
Intellectual Property
The products sold by Torotel are not protected by patents or licenses. Torotel relies on the expertise of its employees in both the design and manufacture of its products. Because of the highly competitive nature of the industry, it is possible that a competitor may also learn to design and produce products with similar performance characteristics. Torotel has been issued U.S. Trademark Registration #1,123,071 for "TOROTEL". This trademark registration expires July 24, 2029. 
Environmental Laws
In fiscal year 2020, Torotel incurred costs of approximately $42,000 to ensure compliance with federal, state and local regulations on the proper handling, storage, disposal, and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of employees, the community, and the environment. Torotel anticipates similar costs to be incurred in the fiscal year ending April 30, 2020.
Employees
Torotel presently employs approximately 170 full-time employees. We believe an adequate supply of qualified personnel is available in our immediate vicinity. Torotel's employees are not affiliated with any union.
