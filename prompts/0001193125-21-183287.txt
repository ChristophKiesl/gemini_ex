Overview 
 BARK is a company of dog obsessed people dedicated to making dogs happy. BARK is a vertically integrated, data driven, omnichannel brand serving dogs across the four key categories of Play, Food, Health, and Home. BARKs dog-obsessed team applies its unique, data-driven understanding of what makes each dog special to design playstyle-specific toys, delicious and satisfying treats, food, and wellness supplements, and best in class offerings that foster the health and happiness of dogs. Founded in 2012, BARK loyally serves dogs nationwide with monthly subscription offerings, BarkBox and Super Chewer; a personalized meal delivery service for dogs, BARK Eats; custom collections through online marketplaces and via brick and mortar retail partners, including Target and Amazon; wellness products that meet dogs needs with BARK Bright through monthly subscriptions; BARKS add to box (ATB) platform; and individually on its website BarkShop.com. 
 During the year ended March 31, 2021 and prior to the Merger, the Company was a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 8, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination (a business combination) with one or more businesses. 
 Initial Public Offering 
 On November 13, 2020, we consummated our Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 25,000,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $250,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 4,500,000 warrants (Private Warrants) to Northern Star Sponsor LLC, our sponsor (Sponsor), at a price of $1.50 per Private Warrant in a private placement, generating gross proceeds of $6,750,000. 
 On November 24, 2020, in connection with the underwriters election to partially exercise their over-allotment option, the Company sold an additional 435,000 Units for total gross proceeds of $4,350,000. Simultaneously with the partial closing of the over-allotment option, we also consummated the sale of an additional 58,000 Private Warrants at $1.50 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $87,000. 
 Following the IPO, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the Private Warrants, a total of $254,350,000 was placed in a trust account. We incurred $14,437,777 in transaction costs, consisting of $5,087,000 of underwriting fees, $8,902,250 of deferred underwriting fees and $448,527 of other costs. Of the total transaction costs, $13,926,600 was charged to additional paid-in capital and $511,117 was charged to other income (expense) transaction costs incurred in connection with warrant liabilities. 
 As of March 31, 2021, we had cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of $254,382,396 (including approximately $32,396 of interest income and unrealized gains) consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 180 days or less. Through March 31, 2021, we did not withdraw any of interest earned on the trust account to pay our franchise and income taxes. Proceeds held in the trust account and not used in connection with consummating our business combination will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 
 Recent Developments and Subsequent Events 
 On December 16, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (Merger Agreement) by and among the Company, NSAC Merger Sub Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company incorporated in Delaware on December 14, 2020 (Merger Sub), and Barkbox, Inc., a Delaware corporation (BarkBox). 
 On June 1, 2021 (the Closing Date), pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company consummated (the Closing) the merger of Merger Sub with BarkBox, with BarkBox surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger), and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Transactions). In connection with the Closing, the Company changed its name to The Original BARK Company. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each stockholder of BarkBoxs common and preferred stock (including stockholders issued common stock as a result of the conversion of BarkBoxs outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in 2019 and 2020 (other than the 2025 Convertible Notes (as defined below)) received 8.7425 shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Common Stock), per share of BarkBoxs common stock and preferred stock, respectively, owned by such BarkBox stockholder that was outstanding immediately prior to the Closing. 
 In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, (1) options to purchase shares of BarkBoxs common stock were converted into options to purchase an aggregate of 29,257,576 shares of Common Stock and (2) warrants to purchase shares of BarkBoxs equity were converted into warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,897,212 shares of Common Stock. 
 Additionally, at the Closing, BarkBoxs 5.50% convertible senior secured notes due 2025 (the 2025 Convertible Notes) were assumed by the Company and were initially convertible at the election of the holders into 7,713,121 shares of Common Stock based on the interest accrued as of Closing. 
 Concurrently with the Closing, certain investors purchased an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock in a private placement at a price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $200,000,000. 
 In addition, at the Closing, each of the 6,358,750 outstanding shares of the Companys Class B common stock were converted into a share of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. 
 Further information regarding BarkBox and the Transactions is set forth in our definitive proxy statement that was filed with the SEC on May 12, 2021. Investors may read such filing by going to the SEC website at www.sec.gov.

 Business after the Merger 
 Our Mission 
 Our mission is to make all dogs happy. We believe that dogs and humans are better together and we aspire to be the worlds favorite dog brand. We are committed to satisfying each individual dogs distinct personality and preferences. 
Who We Are 
 BARK is a company of dog obsessed people dedicated to making dogs happy. We were founded in 2012 by Matt Meeker, Carly Strife and Henrik Werdelin, who were inspired by Matts love for his Great Dane, Hugo. They discovered a lack of engaging and innovative products that could keep Hugo happy and the three founders quickly realized there was a broader unmet consumer need of fellow dog parents who were similarly focused on 
 their dogs happiness and wellbeing. 
 We are a vertically integrated, data-driven, omnichannel brand serving dogs across the four key categories of Play, Food, Health and Home. Our direct to consumer business, which is primarily comprised of subscription products, drive the majority of our revenues. Our expanding retail and commerce distribution channels enable BARK to serve the broader needs of dog parents beyond our monthly subscription boxes. Dog parents can buy our products on online marketplaces such as Amazon, and through a large network of retail partners including Target, Petco, PetSmart, Costco, Bed Bath & Beyond, and CVS. 
 Everything BARK sells is designed and developed by BARK and branded BARK. We leverage an ever-growing collection of proprietary data, market data and customer insights to deliver customized products designed to meet the needs of each dog. 
 
2 


  We use this data to design and develop our products to satisfy particular dog attributes, such as size and breed, and leverage it along with machine learning technology to tailor future subscription shipments and Add-to-Box (ATB) recommendations to each individual dogs preferences. We believe the personal and emotional connection from our BARK Happy team helps us to create strong customer connections and brand evangelists. 
 BARKs subscription and direct to consumer offerings include: 
 BarkBox and Super Chewer (Play Category)These subscription products featuring monthly themed boxes of premium-quality BARK toys and treats that are delivered directly to a dogs home, with Super Chewer providing products specially tailored to the needs of larger dogs and dogs who love to chew, a market that we believe has been underserved. Subscribers have the option to increase the number of toys and treats or add incremental products each month through our monthly Add-to-Box, or ATB, offerings. We also offer the toys and treats included in subscription boxes as individual SKUs through our website BarkShop.com (BarkShop) as well as through BARKs retail commerce channel partners. 
 BARK Eats (Food Category)BARK Eats is our personalized monthly meal plan serving the mass- premium dog food segment. The BARK Eats experience begins with a consultation with a nutritionist and features a high-touch customer relationship program through our BARK Happy team that allows dog parents to customize their dogs food blend of kibble, toppers and supplements, and to properly portion the meals. BARK Eats can be personalized each month and evolves along with dogs dietary needs over time. We believe the dry dog food market is underserved and ripe for disruption. We believe we are the first digitally-native direct to consumer brand that offers a personalized, adjustable and customizable monthly dog food service in the dry dog food category at a mass market price point. Further, we believe that the value proposition of BARK Eats, which provides a customized, portioned, high quality healthy food, at a mass market price point, will appeal broadly to dog parents. 
 BARK Bright (Health Category)BARK Bright is our health and wellness offering. Our first BARK Bright product is a dog dental kit, which includes a proprietary triple-enzyme gel that can be combined with delicious treat-like dental sticks that dogs can chew. This eliminates the arduous task of brushing a dogs teeth while still effectively fighting germs and bad breath. Our BARK Bright dental kit provides an innovative regimen for dog dental care, and is available through monthly subscriptions, ATB, individually on Barkshop and in our retail commerce channel through retailers and other online marketplaces. We are currently developing additional BARK Bright products, including flea and tick treatments and nutritionist-formulated supplements. We also offer BARK Bright health and wellness products through BarkShop.com as well as through BARKs retail commerce channel partners. 
 BARKs third party retail commerce channel and collaborative brand offerings include: 
 BARK Home (Home Category)BARK Home offers dog parents a variety of products for daily life, including dog beds, bowls, collars, harnesses and leashes. We also sell BARK Home products through our website BarkShop.com. 
 BARK toys and treats, BARK Bright and BARK Home are available on online marketplaces such as Amazon, and through a large network of retail partners including Target, Petco, PetSmart, Costco, Bed Bath & Beyond, and CVS. 
 BARK also collaborates with, and makes products for, brands such as Subaru, Dunkin, and Anheuser Busch to build its brand awareness, expand distribution, and engage shared fans. 
 BARK Happy is our customer service team as well as our platform for insight collection and cross promotion. We believe the personal and emotional connection from BARK Happy team helps us to create strong customer 
 
3 


  relationships and brand evangelists. The BARK Happy team has over 250,000 unique interactions with dog parents each month. We leverage these interactions to serve our customers better as well as to gather data to inform design and development of our future products and tailor offerings to an individual dogs preferences. We believe the combination of personal connections and data driven design helps drive retention and lifetime value. 
 
4 


 Super Chewer (Play Category) 
 In 2017, we launched Super Chewer to address the needs of larger dogs and dogs who love to chew. Super Chewer is a monthly delivery of toys designed to be durable, bold, original, with innovative designs and treats in a category that we believe has been underserved. Super Chewer features tough and functionally exciting toys that are made with a range of durable materials such as natural rubber and ballistic nylon. Similar to BarkBox, each months subscription box features a monthly theme that is designed to delight dog and dog parent alike. Super Chewer toys are also available at retail and across our commerce channels.

 Our Growth Strategies 
 We plan to be a dog parents partner from those first days with a puppy throughout their dogs entire adult life. BARK seeks to be there every step of the way serving dogs needs in Play, Food, Health, and Home. Our ambition is to grow BARK to be the worlds favorite dog brand. 
 We expect to expand our portfolio of dog products and services, including BARK Eats and BARK Bright; effectively market to grow our subscriber base; grow subscriptions and ecommerce sales for each subscriber through our subscriber relationships, ATB and refreshed user journey; and expand channels in our retail and e-commerce business. We also plan to assess timing of global expansion to take the BARK brand global and serve international dog parents. 
 We believe that we are well-positioned in the rapidly-growing pet industry with a highly-loyal customer base, and our key strategies to grow our business include: 
 Expand into new product categories: We intend to leverage our customer insights and our ATB platform to expand into new product categories. For example, when we launched our BARK Bright dental kit, we initially marketed exclusively to our BarkBox and Super Chewer subscribers through our ATB platform, and we sold over $100,000 in kits within 48 hours of launch. We believe our ability to generate sales of new products from BARK toys and treat subscribers is indicative of the high level of trust we have built with our subscribers.
 BARK Eats Opportunity: We believe BARK Eats, which represented less than 5% of our fiscal year 2020 revenue, presents a substantial opportunity for growth. BARK Eats is our personalized, portion controlled, 
 
6 


  nutritious, monthly meal plan for dogs. We believe we are the first digitally-native direct to consumer brand that offers a personalized, and customizable monthly dog food service in the dry dog food category at a mass market price point. The BARK Eats experience features a high-touch customer relationship program through our BARK Happy team that allows dog parents to customize their dogs food blend of kibble, toppers/flavors, and healthy supplements, as well as to properly portion the meals. BARK Eats can be personalized each month as their dogs dietary needs evolve over time. BARK Eats is currently available direct to consumer in the Columbus, Ohio market, and we expect to nine markets in 2021. 
 BARK Bright: BARK Bright represented less than 5% of our fiscal year 2020 revenue. We believe there is opportunity for growth in the dog health and wellness market, which we believe has historically lacked innovation and underserved dogs and their dog parents. For example, while dental health affects 80% of dogs, the most popular dental treats do not contain active ingredients that break down plaque and tartar. In addition, dog parents find manually brushing their dogs teeth with toothpaste too laborious to maintain a daily regimen. We believe no other dog dental product pairs a triple-enzyme gel for fighting germs, bad breath, and keeping teeth and gums healthy with a delicious treat, making dental care fun for dogs and hassle free for dog parents. We are currently developing additional BARK Bright products, including flea & tick treatments and nutritionist-formulated supplements. 
 Grow our subscriber base: We intend to continue to increase our brand awareness and cost-effectively reach new subscribers through a combination of word of mouth, referrals, advertising and other marketing efforts. In addition, we aim to continue to partner with content owners, such as The Grinch (Universal Studios, Holiday 2019), SCOOB! (Warner Bros., Summer 2020), Home Alone (Disney, Holiday 2020) and the Peanuts characters (Peanuts Worldwide, Holiday 2020). 
 Sell and cross-sell our new products to existing subscribers:
We seek to leverage our subscription model by informing our more than 8.5 million email contacts, which includes our new and former subscribers, of our new product offerings. In addition, we thoughtfully create cross-promotions of new or add-on products and services to subscribers such as our ATB offerings, which prompts a subscriber before each monthly shipment to add another treat or toy to their shipment before it is shipped to their home. ATB can be in the form of one-time purchases added to a BarkBox or Super Chewer order, or as an automatically renewing shipment bundled with our subscription products. ATB uses our machine learning-based algorithms, to enable high quality interactions and suggestions which lead to high levels of conversion. 
 Grow our retail and e-commerce business: We view retail and e-commerce as both a distribution channel, as well as a critical and profitable platform for increasing brand awareness. We offer our products in more than 23,000 retail store locations, which has significantly increased our reach and brand awareness. Fifteen BARK SKUs have each topped $1 million at a single partner (three have topped $2 million, and one toy has topped $3 million). In addition to traditional retail channels, we have marketing partnerships with brands such as Subaru, Dunkin Donuts, and Anheuser Busch among others. We intend to grow our retail partnerships and collaborations domestically and internationally. We will also plan to assess timing of global expansion of our subscription products to take the BARK brand global and serve international dog parents.

 Advertising and Marketing 
 BARKs approach to advertising and marketing is to be present where our customers are. BARKs technology- and science-driven approach towards marketing and social media are designed to provide an efficient, cost-effective and data rich platform, allowing us to engage new customers and reach our current customers, as well as manage and track the effectiveness of our spending. BARK reaches consumers across multiple digital and social media platforms including product placements, websites, blogs and online reviews, as well as with tailored messaging on popular digital hubs including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and through affiliate and influencer marketing programs. BARK also engages in print media advertising (mailers) and television advertisements targeting potential customers across the United States. 
 In addition to paid channels, many of BARKs new customers originate organically from word-of-mouth and non-paid referrals by our existing customers as well as from general awareness of our product offering. BARKs ability to retain a high level of non-paid customer acquisitions may reduce the level of marketing investment required to continue our growth. 
 
8 


 We believe the style and voice of BARKs messaging has also been an incredibly important differentiator for BARKs ability to garner the attention of customers and potential customers in a crowded marketing world. The pet product space is traditionally one of the slower industries to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of entertainment mediums. BARK has on numerous occasions been recognized as an innovative business in the world of content marketing, beyond the larger pet industry. We believe this innovation in the world of content and social media through the strategic hiring of dog-obsessed comedians and creative personalities will enable BARK to remain relevant as the advertising tactics and mediums continue to change. 
 Manufacturing 
 BARK purchases substantially all of our merchandise directly from third-party manufacturers, who typically manufacture the products exclusively for BARK. Some of these vendors operate their own manufacturing facilities and others subcontract the manufacturing to other parties. BARKs manufacturers generally agree to terms that are substantially similar to its standard manufacturer terms, which govern its business relationship. Although BARK does not have long-term agreements with its vendors, BARK has long-standing relationships with a diverse base of vendors that BARK believes to be mutually satisfactory. These vendors are located in multiple countries, which we believe helps mitigate our supply chain risk. 
 All of BARKs exclusive products are required to be produced according to BARKs specifications, and our manufactures warrant that such products will perform in accordance with BARKs specifications. BARKs manufacturing and supplier contracts are generally on year-to-year terms and provide BARK with the additional right to terminate the agreement for uncured material breaches within 30 days. BARK requires that all of its manufacturers comply with applicable law and BARK generally has the right to audit the suppliers facilities. 
Distribution and Inventory Management 
 BARK currently utilizes global third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute finished products from its distribution facilities to support its domestic operations. These logistics providers manage various distribution activities including product receipt, warehousing, certain limited product inspection activities, and coordinating outbound shipping. 
 BARK manages its inventory levels by analyzing product sell-through, forecasting demand, analyzing product ratings and placing orders with our manufacturers before BARK receives firm orders from customers to ensure sufficient availability. 
 BARKs Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 
 BARK believes that our rights in our intellectual property, including trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to its proprietary technology, are important to our marketing efforts to develop brand recognition and differentiate our brand from competitors. BARK owns a number of trademarks that have been registered, or for which registration applications are pending, in the United States as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions. These registered or pending trademarks include, among others, Bark, BARKBox, BARK Bright, BARK Eats, BARK Essentials, BARK Super Chewer, Super Chewer, BARKPOST, Destroyers, Destroyers Club, and Dog People Get It. The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that BARK, as the registered owner, or BARKs licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with similar goods. BARK expects to pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent BARK believes they would be beneficial and cost-effective. 
 In addition to trademark protection, BARK owns numerous domain names, including www.barkbox.com, www.bark.co, and www.barkshop.com. BARK also enters into, and relies on, confidentiality and proprietary 
 
9 


  rights agreements with its employees, consultants, contractors and business partners to protect its trade secrets, proprietary technology and other confidential information. BARK further controls the use of its proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our customer terms of use on our website and in our agreements with vendors. 
 We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has significantly contributed to BARKs success to date. BARK continually engages with manufacturers to develop and market better quality dog products under its brand names to better serve its customers at a lower price. 
 Competition 
 The dog products industry is highly competitive, fragmented, and spread across four primary segments: 
 

 | supermarkets, warehouse clubs and mass merchants;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | specialty pet store chains;
--+----------------------------


 | traditional or neighborhood pet stores; and
--+--------------------------------------------


 | subscription service businesses and e-tailers.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 We believe that the principal competitive factors in BARKs market are product selection and quality, customer service, price, brand awareness and loyalty, reliability and trust, convenience and speed at which orders are delivered to our customers. We believe that BARK differentiates itself from its competitors by the strength of its brand, customer knowledge and engagement, unique and exclusive products, data driven design and marketing, and achieving a high level of performance with regard to these competitive factors. 
 Dog food is also a highly competitive industry. BARK Eats competes with manufacturers of conventional dog food, such as Mars, Nestlé and Big Heart Pet Brands (part of The J.M. Smucker Company). It also competes with specialty and natural pet food manufacturers such as FreshPet, Colgate-Palmolive and General Mills. In addition, BARK Eats competes with many regional niche brands in individual geographic markets. Given a North American retail landscape dominated by large retailers, with limited shelf space and a significant number of competing products, competitors actively support their brands through marketing, advertising, promotional spending and discounting. Competitive factors in the dog food industry include product quality, ingredients, brand awareness and loyalty, product variety, product packaging and design, reputation, price, advertising, promotion and nutritional claims. 
 The dog health and wellness industry is highly competitive. BARK Bright competes directly and indirectly with both manufacturers and distributors of pet health and wellness products and online distributors, as well as with veterinarians. BARK Bright directly faces competition from companies that distribute various pet health and wellness products to traditional retailers such as Bayer AG, Central Garden and Pet Company, Hartz (Unicharm Corp.), Mars, Inc., Manna Pro, Nestlé S.A., Spectrum Holdings, Promika LLC, Tevra Brands, and The J.M. Smucker Company, most of which are larger than BARK and have greater financial resources. Similarly, BARK Bright faces intense competition from manufacturers who sell dog health and wellness products to e-commerce and other retailers and to veterinarians. 
 Government Regulation 
 BARKs business is subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulations applicable to companies conducting business on the Internet. Jurisdictions vary as to how, or whether, existing laws governing areas such as personal privacy and data security, consumer protection or sales and other taxes, among other areas, apply to the Internet and e-commerce, and these laws are continually evolving. Related laws may govern the manner in which BARK stores or transfers sensitive information, or impose obligations on BARK in the event of a security breach or an inadvertent disclosure of such information. International jurisdictions impose different, and sometimes more 
 
10 


  stringent, consumer and privacy protections. Additionally, tax regulations in jurisdictions where BARK does not currently collect state or local taxes may subject BARK to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, or to additional taxes, or to requirements intended to assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulations, the application of laws from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to its business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally could result in significant additional taxes on its business. Further, BARK could be subject to fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements. See Risk Factors. Changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of BARKs website and mobile application and its financial results. The continued growth of and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in more laws and regulations that impose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies.
In addition, BARK is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations intended to protect public health, natural resources and the environment. BARKs operations, including its manufacturing outsourcing partners, are subject to regulation by OSHA, the FDA, the USDA, and by various other federal, state, local, and foreign authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and import of its products, including food safety standards. See Risk FactorsBARK is subject to extensive governmental regulation and BARK may incur material liabilities under, or costs in order to comply with, existing or future laws and regulation, and its failure to comply may result in enforcements, recalls, and other adverse actions. 
 
11 


 Legal Proceedings 
 We may be involved from time to time in litigation regarding, among other matters, intellectual property claims, consumer claims, contract disputes, regulatory matters, employment claims, and securities law claims. Litigation, dispute resolution proceedings and investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. The results of complex legal proceedings are often expensive, uncertain, and difficult to predict. An unfavorable outcome with respect to any such lawsuit or claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
12 


 Periodic Reporting and Financial and Other Information 
 Our common stock, and public warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. 
 
13 


 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following November 13, 2025, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
