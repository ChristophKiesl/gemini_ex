Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview History 
 We are an exploration stage mining company, in the business of acquiring and developing metal and mineral properties that may contain recoverable gold and silver deposits. Our general business strategy is to acquire and develop mining properties positioned for low-cost production. We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 8, 1991 under the name Azco Mining, Inc. and on August 21, 2007, we changed our name to Santa Fe Gold Corporation by filing a Certificate of Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State. 
 
As an exploration mining company, we are engaged in the business of acquiring and developing mines and mining properties as well as securing production from existing and developed mining and mineral properties. Currently we own certain mining leases and other mineral rights, however none of them contain any proven or probable reserves, as defined in Regulation S-K 1300; and they are all currently considered “exploratory” in nature. Currently we have three projects, each of which management has determined is “material” based on the costs to secure the rights associated with them, as required by Regulation S-K 1304, these are: our Alhambra Property, the Jim Crow Imperial Mine and the Billali Mine, each of which are exploratory in nature and is described more fully in the properties section of this report.
 Although management is optimistic about its plans for developing certain such properties, to date, minimal mining activities have commenced at the Jim Crow Imperial Mine and the Billali Mine sites and there can be no assurance that the Company’s mining activities will be profitable. 
 After the dismissal from bankruptcy in June 2016, we had no assets and approximately $20 million of indebtedness was reinstated. The properties we currently own were acquired subsequent to our dismissal from bankruptcy proceedings. We will be required to raise the capital that is required, in part, to continue to development of our current mining properties, construct a mill operation for processing our head ore and to help meet our continuing working capital requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising the capital necessary to implement our business plan or if we are successful, that there may not be additional or superseding demands on our capital resources. Although the Company has been successful in meeting its capital requirements in the past, since emerging from Bankruptcy and management continues to be optimistic about being able to secure needed funding, any failure to do so or any unforeseen expenses or other demands on the Company’s capital could result in the need to curtail or cease operation, resulting in losses to investors. 
 Exploration Stage Company
 We are considered an exploration stage company, as defined in S-K 1300. The Company has not demonstrated the existence of mineral reserves at any of our properties. Under Regulation S-K 1300, the SEC defines a “mineral reserve” as “an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project.” To have mineral resources, there must be reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Per the SEC, “probable mineral reserves” are the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some cases, a measured mineral resource and “proven mineral reserves” can only result from measured mineral resources. Mineral reserves cannot be considered proven or probable unless and until they are supported by a preliminary feasibility study or feasibility study, indicating that the mineral reserves have had the requisite geologic, technical and economic work performed and are economically and legally extractable. We have not completed a preliminary feasibility study or feasibility study with regard to any of our properties to date. We do not anticipate leaving exploration stage company for the foreseeable future. Under S-K we will not exit the exploration stage until such time, if ever, that we demonstrate the existence of proven or probable mineral reserves that meet the guidelines under S-K 1300. When we begin extracting material from our properties, we will remain an exploration company under S-K 1300 guidelines.

Company Organizational Chart
 

Overview of Current Events
 Our Business
 
As a mining company in the exploration stage, we are engaged in the business of acquiring mineral properties that may contain recoverable mineral deposits, (we are currently targeting gold and/or silver deposits) with a view to develop them and, if there are mineral resources identified or mineral reserves, to actively mine them. Although management is optimistic about its prospects for favorable exploration results on the properties in which it has acquired interests, to date no mineral reserves have been determined. There are however minimal mining activities that have commenced and we have conducted limited extraction activity. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance it will continue or, that if it does, that any of the mining activities will be profitable, with or without mineral reserves. 
 
Management’s continuing efforts were successfully rewarded as the Company secured, what management believes will ultimately be, promising mining leases and other mineral rights. The properties we now own are exploratory in nature and consist of certain mining leases and other mineral rights. As stated, they were acquired subsequent to our dismissal from bankruptcy proceedings and, although management is optimistic, none of them contain any proven and probable reserves. We are in the process of raising the capital required, in part (i) to begin further exploration activities of these current mining properties, and (ii) to help meet our working capital requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising the capital necessary to implement our business plan or that, if we are successful in raising such capital, that there may not be additional or superseding demands on our capital resources. Although the Company has been successful in meeting its capital requirements in the past, and since emerging from Bankruptcy, management continues to be optimistic about its ability to continue securing the funding needed to execute on its business plan, any failure to do so or any unforeseen expenses or other demands on the Company’s capital could result in the need to curtail or cease some or all of the Company’s operations, resulting in losses to investors. 
 
In October 2021, we exercised the purchase option for $164,335 on the mill property in Duncan, Arizona, and the transaction closed on November 9, 2021.
 
The Company is currently in the process of acquiring a mill operation for its head ore to be located on its property in Duncan, Arizona. The seller of the mill has disassembled the mill in Kellogg, Idaho and relocated the mill to the Duncan, Arizona site. Currently all associated costs of the mill and its relocation are being accumulated and finalized by the seller. At this time there are no agreements between the seller and the Company as to terms and sales price of the delivered disassembled mill and such price is anticipated to be negotiated and determined in late fall 2022, when the necessary funding will be raised by the Company for the acquisition of the mill equipment and its construction. At the time of filing this Form 10-K, negotiations for the purchase of the disassembled mill with the seller have not taken place and will be finalized upon the Company raising the adequate funding for the acquisition and determination if the seller or the Company will be responsible for its construction at the mill site. 
 Our Status as an Exchange Act Registrant and Trading in our Common Stock
 The Company’s common stock has been quoted on OTC Markets (PINK) most recently under the trading symbol “SFEG.” However, in July 2020 it received notice that on June 25, 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or “Commission”) 

7

issued an order suspending trading under Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act.”). Thereafter, the Commission commenced administrative proceedings to de-register the Company’s common stock under Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act. Issuers of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act are required under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder to file current and accurate information in periodic reports with the Commission. Specifically, Exchange Act Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports, and Exchange Act Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. The Company’s inability to prepare and file the required quarterly and annual reports began with the misappropriation of funds by its former CEO; this had a direct impact on its financial statements as originally filed. This not only resulted in the need to amend and restate the 2017 annual report and related quarterly reports that had been filed with the Commission on Form 10-K and on Forms 10-Q, but since a restatement necessarily has a material effect on all future reports, the Company was not in a position to confidently restate its financial statements until it was able to fully and accurately define the scope of: (a) the issue created by Mr. Laws and (b) the subsequent actions taken against Mr. Laws by the Company and other unrelated parties. Compounding the issue, the Company’s auditor declined to continue auditing the Company’s financial statements, management believes, due to its potential liability and the conflicts that could result from any of the Law’s proceedings. Thereafter, the Company had difficulty engaging a qualified replacement audit firm, in part because of the perception of risk associated with the required restatements of its financial statements. 
 
Ultimately, while the underlying circumstances that gave rise to the Company’s delinquent filings were, in part, caused by an individual who was dismissed upon discovery of his misappropriation of funds, the difficulty in finding a replacement audit firm was an additional factor that was beyond the control of management that contributed substantially to delays in our filings. Although we have since filed the Annual Reports that were delinquent, one of which required restating our financials and all but three of the Quarterly Reports that were delinquent have since been filed, the Commission’s standard position has been that, once de-registration proceedings are commenced for failure to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, it will not then grant a right to cure or comply. Thus, when the Commission then commenced administrative proceedings under Section 12(j), the Registrant’s only options were to defend the matter in litigation or to settle it and agree with the Commission’s order for de-registration of securities registered under Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act. Therefore, given: (a) the protracted nature of litigation in general, and (b) the high expense associated with defending an adversary proceeding with the Commission and (c) the low probability of a successful outcome, compared with the fact that: (x) a settlement with the SEC would allow the Company to re-file a registration statement as soon as it was drafted, (y) the Company had already completed one of the required audits, was in a position to complete the other, and was in a position to file a Registration Statement on Form 10-12G, and (z) Form 10-12G Registration Statements are automatically effective 60 days from the date of filing (unless the Commission objects, which is rarely done, although it is now common to receive comments by the Commission that then must be addressed). After considering the forgoing, the Company determined that it was in the best interest of its shareholders to settle and consent to the de-registration of its common stock and to file a Registration Statement on Form 10-12G. On December 17, 2020, the SEC order suspending trading went into effect.
 
On May 14, 2022, the Company filed a Form 10-12G Registration statement with the SEC and was withdrawn by the Company on July 12, 2021 due to comments not completely cleared by the SEC. On July 20, 2021, we refiled a new Form 10-12G and on September 17, 2021 we withdrew the filing due to SEC comments requiring financial restatements. The Company made the required financial restatements and our auditors recertified the audited financial statements and we submitted a new Form 10-12G on June 14, 2022 and on August 4, 2022 the SEC declared our Form 10-12G Registration effective. Although the Company is not trading currently and we are a reporting Company under Section 12(g) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and are required to timely file periodic and current reports with the SEC.
 
The Company is working on securing a broker dealer to prepare Form 211 for submittal to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) for review and approval. Upon receiving FINRA’s approval and issuance our trading symbol, the Company will request a review from the OTC for removal the Caveat Emptor designation associated with our prior trading symbol and submit our application to the OTC to trade on their QB tier.
 Competition 
 The mining industry is highly competitive. We will be competing with numerous companies, substantially all of which have far greater resources available to them that we are likely to have when Swe commence operations. We therefore may be at a significant disadvantage in the course of obtaining materials, supplies, labor, and equipment from time to time. Additionally, we are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of mining, exploration and development. Because there is presently no known mineral reserve at this time on our existing properties, we have not determined the impact of any capital expenditures on our earnings or competitive position in the event a potentially commercially mineable ore deposit is discovered.
Compliance with Government Regulations
 Continuing to acquire and explore mineral properties in the State of New Mexico will require the Company to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the State of New Mexico and the United States.

The mining industry, (specifically the activities of exploration, drilling) operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all operations; and permits are required by local, state and federal government agencies. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. The various permits address such issues as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues. 
 
Like all other mining companies doing business in the United States, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations designed to protect the quality of the air and water, and to protect threatened or endangered species, in the vicinity of our mining operations. These include “permitting” or “pre-operating approval” requirements that are designed: (i) to ensure the environmental integrity of a proposed mining facility, (ii) to ensure operating plans are designed to mitigate the effects of discharges into the environment during exploration, mining operations, and reclamation and (iii) that post-operation plans are designed to remediate the lands affected by a mining facility once commercial mining operations have ceased.
 
United States 
 
Mining in the State of New Mexico is subject to federal, state and local law. Three types of laws are of particular importance to the Company’s U.S. mineral properties: those affecting land ownership and mining rights; those regulating mining operations; and those dealing with the environment.
Land Ownership
 
 On Federal Lands, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872 (“General Mining Law”) as amended, 30 U.S.C. §§ 21-161 (various sections), which allows the location of mining claims on certain Federal Lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and proper compliance with claim location requirements. A valid mining claim provides the holder with the right to conduct mining operations for the removal of locatable minerals, subject to compliance with the General Mining Law and New Mexico state law governing the staking and registration of mining claims, as well as compliance with various federal, state and local operating and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances. As the owner or lessee of the unpatented mining claims, the Company has the right to conduct mining operations on the lands subject to the prior procurement of required operating permits and approvals, compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable mining lease, and compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances. 
Mining Operations
 
The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws. The State of New Mexico likewise requires various permits and approvals before mining operations can begin, although the state and federal regulatory agencies usually cooperate to minimize duplication of permitting efforts. The State of New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division requires mine permits for each mining location. The permit has an Annual Permit Fee that is due by April 30 of each year. The Annual Permit Fee for minimal impact mines is currently $250. 
 
Prior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, the operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project. Generally, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan to restore or replace the affected area. Often these requirements result in delays and/or costly studies or changes in the proposed activities; which may extend the time to completion. Although this may be necessary in order to mitigate the negative impact of certain aspects of an initial plan, all of these factors make it more difficult and costly to operate; and have a negative, and sometimes fatal, impact on the economic viability of the exploration or planned mining operation. Finally, it is possible that future changes in laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, requiring the planned activities to be economically reevaluated at that time.
 
Effect of Existing or Potential Government Regulations 
 
Mineral exploration, including mining operations is subject to governmental regulation. Our operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation such as restrictions on production, price controls, tax increases, expropriation of property, environmental and pollution controls or changes in conditions under which minerals may be marketed. An excess supply of certain minerals may exist from time to time due to lack of markets, restrictions on exports, and numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include market fluctuations and government regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, allowable production and importing and exporting minerals. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately determined, and we are not aware of any probable government regulations that would impact the Company at this time, although there can be no assurances that regulations may not arise in the future. To the extent that government regulations do arise in the future, they may have a negative effect on our operations, which may in turn, result in losses to investors. This section is intended as a brief overview of the laws and regulations described herein and is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject matter.

Environmental Laws
 
Federal legislation in the United States and implementing regulations adopted and administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies—in particular, legislation such as the federal Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Forest Management Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ‘have a direct bearing on domestic mining operations. These federal initiatives are often administered and enforced through state agencies operating under parallel state statutes and regulations.
The Clean Water Act

The Federal Clean Water Act is the principal Federal environmental protection law regulating mining operations in the United States as it pertains to water quality. At the state level, water quality is regulated by the New Mexico Environment Department. If our exploration or any future development activities could affect a ground water aquifer, we are required to apply for a ground water discharge permit in compliance with the groundwater regulations. If exploration affects surface water, then compliance with surface water regulations is required.
The Clean Air Act 
 
The Federal Clean Air Act establishes ambient air quality standards, limits the discharges of new sources and hazardous air pollutants and establishes a federal air quality permitting program for such discharges. Hazardous materials are defined in the Federal Clean Air Act and enabling regulations adopted under the Federal Clean Air Act to include various metals. The Federal Clean Air Act also imposes limitations on the level of particulate matter generated from mining operations.
National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”)  
 
NEPA requires all governmental agencies to consider the impact on the human environment of major federal actions as therein defined.
 
Endangered Species Act (“ESA”)
 
The ESA requires federal agencies to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. In order to facilitate the conservation of imperiled species, the ESA establishes an interagency consultation process. When a federal agency proposes an action that “may affect” a listed species, it must consult with the USFWS and must prepare a “biological assessment” of the effects of a major construction activity if the USFWS advises that a threatened species may be present in the area of the activity.
National Forest Management Act
 
The National Forest Management Act, as implemented through Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, provides a planning framework for lands and resource management of the National Forests. The planning framework seeks to manage the National Forest System resources in a combination that best serves the public interest without impairment of the productivity of the land, consistent with the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960.
Wilderness Act  
 
The Wilderness Act of 1964 created a National Wilderness Preservation System composed of Federally owned areas designated by Congress as “wilderness areas” to be preserved for future use and enjoyment.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) 
 
CERCLA generally imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, such persons may be subject to strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold the Company responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released.

10

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) 
 
RCRA was designed and implemented to regulate the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. It restricts solid waste disposal practices and the management, reuse or recovery of solid wastes and imposes substantial additional requirements on the subcategory of solid wastes that are determined to be hazardous. Like the Clean Water Act, RCRA provides for citizens’ suits to enforce the provisions of the law.
National Historic Preservation Act  
 
The National Historic Preservation Act was designed and implemented to protect historic and cultural properties. Compliance with the Act is necessary where federal properties or federal actions are undertaken, such as mineral exploration on federal land, which may impact historic or traditional cultural properties, including native or Indian cultural sites.
Reclamation 
 
We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. As soon as we have a mining operation, we will be required to arrange and pledge certificates of deposits for reclamation with the state regulatory agencies. At this time no reclamation cost is required to be calculated or carried forward. 
Employees
 
We currently have three full time employees as of our current fiscal year end. In order to implement our business plan, we will be required to employ or retain qualified consultants with the technical expertise to evaluate and mine our mineral properties and for administrative duties as required. We currently employ no miners for our mines in in New Mexico as we are currently under a mine maintenance protocol until the processing mill is in operation in Duncan, AZ. 
Employment Agreements
 
Effective July 7, 2020, the Company retained a new Chief Financial Officer and the prior Chief Financial Officer was reassigned to oversee all mining operations as they come on line in our fiscal 2022-23 year. Both parties signed a one-year employment agreement with the Company, with automatic successive one-year renewals provided that neither party has provided notice of termination prior to 30 days from the end of such applicable term.
Insurance
 
We normally maintain property, liability and workmen’s compensation insurance coverages to cover losses or risks incurred in the ordinary course of business. Upon resuming operations, the Company will reinstate our insurance coverages. 
Exploration
 
The Company has spent only nominal amounts during each of the last two fiscal years on exploration and mine development due to the lack of availability to currently economically process mined head ore into concentrates that could be monetized for working capital funds. 
Seasonality 
 
We have no properties at this time that are subject to material restrictions on our operations due to seasonality. 
 
Office Facilities 
 
Our principal offices are located at 2325 San Pedro NE, Suite 225, Albuquerque, NM 87110. Our telephone number is (505) 255-4852 and our mailing address is P.O. BOX 25201, Albuquerque, NM 87125-0201.

Dismissal of Bankruptcy Proceeding and Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization
 
In August 2015, the Company filed for Bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in Delaware in order to secure the existing assets from creditor actions, Case No. 15-11761 (MFW). Notwithstanding the Company’s Bankruptcy, the management continued to search for options that would allow it to continue as a going concern.
 After the dismissal from Bankruptcy, the Company had limited assets, yet remained liable for all commitments and debts that then were outstanding. Santa Fe Gold Barbados, The Lordsburg Mining Company and AZCO are subsidiaries of the Company with no assets and all of their commitments and debts remain. The bankruptcy court set up a trust fund funded by the activities of the Summit mine (main asset sold in bankruptcy proceedings) for five years from the inception of mine production at the Summit mine, with the funds held in trust distributed by an independent trustee to certain unsecured creditors. Following prior management’s failure to provide a plan of reorganization, the resulting significant transactions that occurred upon emergence from bankruptcy were as follows:
 ·
The approximately $20 million of indebtedness outstanding on account of the Company’s finance facilities and unsecured claims were reinstated; and 
 ·
The Court established a trust in April 2016 for the benefit of certain creditors. A profit interest was attached to the Summit mine for the benefit of certain creditors holding unsecured claims filed by each creditor. 
 The Company received Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the dismissal in June 2016, and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy. The only funds available for the future administrative costs were prepaid insurance funds of approximately $49,000. The Company subsequently began selling, on a best-efforts basis, equity for the cash needed for working capital purposes. Currently we have no continuing commitment from any party to provide working capital, and there is no certainty that the Company will be able to continue its current business plan. However, the mining claims / assets that it has managed to secure appear to present a significant opportunity for the Company to continue in the mining business.
