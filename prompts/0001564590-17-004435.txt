ITEM 1: | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Company Background
 
We are a leading asset-light provider of customized transportation and logistics solutions throughout the United States, and in Mexico, Canada and Colombia. We offer our customers a broad array of services across their entire supply chain, including transportation, value-added, and intermodal services.
 
We provide a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics solutions that allow our customers to reduce costs and manage their global supply chains more efficiently. We market our services through a direct sales and marketing network focused on selling our portfolio of services to large customers in specific industry sectors, through a network of agents who solicit freight business directly from shippers, and through company-managed facilities and full service freight forwarding and customs house brokerage offices. At December 31, 2016, we had an agent network totaling approximately 337 agents, and we operated 47 company-managed terminal locations and provided services at 47 logistics locations throughout the United States and in Mexico, Canada and Colombia.
 
We were incorporated in Michigan on December 11, 2001. We have been a publicly held company since February 11, 2005, the date of our initial public offering. We acquired Linc Logistics Company (“Linc”) in October 2012. At the time of the acquisition, Universal and Linc were under common control, and as such, the financial statements of Universal have been retrospectively revised to reflect the accounts of Linc as if they had been consolidated for all previous periods. The acquisition significantly enhanced our position as a leading provider of third party transportation, value-added and intermodal services.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 12755 E. Nine Mile Road, Warren, Michigan 48089. 
 Segment Financial Information
 
We report our financial results in two reportable segments, the transportation segment and the logistics segment, based on the nature of the underlying customer commitment and the types of investments required to support these commitments.  This presentation reflects the manner in which management evaluates our operating segments, including an evaluation of economic characteristics and applicable aggregation criteria.
 
Operations aggregated in our transportation segment are associated with individual freight shipments coordinated by our agents, company-managed terminals and specialized services operations.  In contrast, operations aggregated in our logistics segment deliver value-added services or transportation services to specific customers on a dedicated basis, generally pursuant to contract terms of one year or longer.  Other non-reportable operating segments are comprised of the Company’s subsidiaries that provide support services to other subsidiaries and to owner-operators, including shop maintenance and equipment leasing.

Operations
 
We broadly group our services into the following three service categories: transportation, value-added and intermodal support.
 
Transportation. Our transportation services include dry van, flatbed, heavy haul, dedicated, refrigerated, shuttle and switching operations. These services also include full service domestic and international freight forwarding, customs brokerage, final mile and ground expedite. Transportation services represented approximately $629.2 million, or 58.7%, of our operating revenues in 2016. We transport a wide variety of general commodities, including automotive parts, machinery, building materials, paper, food, consumer goods, furniture, steel and other metals on behalf of customers in various industries. Our transportation services are provided through a network of both union and non-union employee drivers, owner-operators, contract drivers, and third-party transportation providers. We broker freight to third party transportation providers to complement our available capacity. Our transportation services also include full service international freight forwarding, customs house brokerage services, and final mile and ground expedite services, which we refer to collectively as specialized services.
 
Value-Added. Our value-added services, which are typically dedicated to individual customer requirements, include material handling, consolidation, sequencing, sub-assembly, cross-dock services, kitting, repacking, warehousing and returnable container management. Value-added services represented approximately $302.2 million, or 28.2%, of our operating revenues in 2016. Our facilities and services are often directly integrated into the production processes of our customers and represent a critical piece of their supply chains.
 
Intermodal Support. Intermodal operations include rail-truck, steamship-truck and support services. Intermodal support services represented $141.3 million, or 13.1%, of our operating revenues in 2016. Our intermodal support services are primarily short-to-medium distance delivery of rail and steamship containers between the railhead or port and the customer and drayage services.
Business and Growth Strategy
 
The key elements of our strategy are as follows:  
 
Expand our network of agents and owner-operators. Increasing the number of agents and owner-operators has been a driver of our historical growth in transactional transportation services. We intend to continue to recruit qualified agents and owner-operators in order to penetrate new markets, and expand our operations in existing markets. Our agents typically focus on a small number of shippers in a particular market and are attuned to the specific transportation needs of that core group of shippers, while remaining alert to growth opportunities. 
 
Continue to capitalize on strong industry fundamentals and outsourcing trends. We believe long-term industry growth will be supported by manufacturers seeking to outsource non-core logistics functions to cost-effective third-party providers that can efficiently manage increasingly complex global supply chains. We intend to leverage our integrated suite of transportation and logistics services, our network of facilities, our long-term customer relationships, and our reputation for operational excellence to capitalize on favorable industry fundamentals and growth expectations.
 
Target further penetration of key customers in the North American automotive industry. The automotive industry is one of the largest users of global outsourced logistics services, providing us growth opportunities with both existing and new customers. Of our customers generating revenues greater than $100,000 per year, this sector comprised approximately 42.5% of operating revenues in 2016. We intend to capitalize on anticipated continued growth in outsourcing of higher value logistics services in the automotive sector such as sub-assembly and sequencing, which link directly into production lines and require specialized capabilities, technological expertise and strict quality controls. 
 
Continue to expand penetration in other vertical markets. We have a history of providing highly complex value-added logistics services to automotive and other industrial customers. We have developed standardized, modular systems for material handling processes and have extensive experience in rapid implementation and workforce training. These capabilities and our broad portfolio of logistics services are transferable across vertical markets. We believe we can leverage the expertise we initially developed in the automotive sector. In addition to automotive, our targeted industries include aerospace, energy, government services, healthcare, industrial retail, consumer goods, and steel and metals.
 
Competition and Industry
 
The transportation and logistics service industry is highly competitive and extremely fragmented. We compete based on quality and reliability of service, price, breadth of logistics solutions, and IT capabilities. We compete with asset and non-asset based truckload 
 4


and less-than-truckload carriers, intermodal transportation, logistics providers and, in some aspects of our business, railroads. We also compete with other motor carriers for owner-operators and agents. 
 
Our customers may choose not to outsource their logistics operations and, rather, to retain or restore such activities as their own, internal operations. In our largest vertical market, the automotive industry, we compete more frequently with a relatively small number of privately-owned firms or with subsidiaries of large public companies. These vendors have the scope and capabilities to provide the breadth of services required by the large and complex supply chains of automotive original equipment manufacturers. 
 
We also encounter competition from regional and local third-party logistics providers, integrated transportation companies that operate their own aircraft, cargo sales agents and brokers, surface freight forwarders and carriers, airlines, associations of shippers organized to consolidate their members’ shipments to obtain lower freight rates, and internet-based freight exchanges. 
 
In 2016, shippers implemented significant bid activity, which resulted in pricing pressure throughout the year. We believe that our industry continues to be hindered by an insufficient quantity of qualified drivers which creates significant competition for this declining pool of qualified and safe drivers.
 
Pricing is expected to be more favorable during periods of more rapid economic expansion or lack of effective industry-wide trucking capacity. In December 2017, federal regulations are scheduled to mandate the use of ELDs across our industry. These devices are expected to reduce effective industry capacity by more strictly enforcing a driver’s hours of service and, as a result, miles that can be driven each day. We are using ELDs in our entire fleet and have adapted our network and customer base to the utilization constraints. A substantial portion of industry capacity, however, has not implemented ELDs; as a result, we expect industry capacity to tighten after the regulation implementation date.
 Customers 
 
Revenue is generated from customers throughout the United States, and in Mexico, Canada and Colombia. Our customers are largely concentrated in the automotive, steel, oil and gas, alternative energy and manufacturing industries. 
 
A significant portion of our revenues are derived from the domestic auto industry. Of our customers generating revenues greater than $100,000 per year, aggregate sales in the automotive industry totaled 42.5%, 37.3% and 36.5% of revenues during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, General Motors accounted for approximately 17.9%, 11.4% and 9.7% of our total operating revenues, respectively.  Sales to our top 10 customers, including General Motors, totaled 40.9% in 2016.  A significant portion of our revenue also results from our providing capacity to other transportation companies who aggregate loads from a variety of shippers in these and other industries.
 
Independent Contractor Network
 
We utilize a network of agents and owner-operators located throughout the United States and in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. These agents and owner-operators are independent contractors.
 
A significant portion of the interaction with our shippers is provided by our agents. Over 40% of the freight we hauled in 2016 was solicited and controlled by our agents, with the balance generated by company-managed terminals, full service freight forwarding and customs house brokerage offices. Our top 100 agents in 2016 generated approximately 29% of our annual operating revenues. Our agents typically focus on three or four shippers within a particular market and solicit most of their freight business from this core group. By focusing on a relatively small number of shippers, each agent is attuned to the specific transportation needs of that core group of shippers, while remaining alert to growth opportunities. 
 
We also contract with owner-operators to provide greater flexibility in responding to fluctuations in customer demand.  Owner-operators provide their own trucks and are contractually responsible for all associated expenses, included financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and taxes, among other things.  They are also responsible for maintaining compliance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulations.

Revenue Equipment
 The following table represents our equipment used to provide transportation services as of December 31, 2016:
 
 
Type of Equipment | Company- owned or Leased | | Owner- Operator Provided | | Total
------------------+--------------------------+-------+--------------------------+-------+------
Tractors | | 892 | | 2,909 | | 3,801
Yard Tractors | | 208 | | - | | 208 
Trailers | | 4,154 | | 1,685 | | 5,839
Chassis | | 1,067 | | - | | 1,067
Containers | | 804 | | - | | 804 

Employees and Contractors
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 6,275 employees. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also engaged, on average, the full-time equivalency of 2,172 individuals on a contract basis. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 31% of our employees in the United States, Canada and Colombia, and 94% of our employees in Mexico were members of unions and subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.  
Risk Management and Insurance
 Our customers and federal regulations generally require that we provide insurance for auto liability and general liability claims up to $1.0 million per occurrence. Accordingly, in the United States, we purchase such insurance from a licensed casualty insurance carrier, which is a related party, providing a minimum $1.0 million of coverage for individual auto liability and general liability claims. We are self-insured for auto and general liability claims above $1.0 million unless riders are sought to satisfy individual customer or vendor contract requirements. In Mexico, our operations and investment in equipment are insured through an internationally recognized third-party insurance underwriter. 
 
We typically self-insure for the risk of motor cargo liability claims and material handling claims. Accordingly, we establish financial reserves for anticipated losses and expenses related to motor cargo liability and material handling claims, and such reserves are periodically evaluated and adjusted to reflect our experience. 
 
To reduce our exposure to claims incurred while a vehicle is being operated without a trailer attached or is being operated with an attached trailer which does not contain or carry any cargo, we require our owner-operators to maintain non-trucking use liability coverage (which we refer to as deadhead bobtail coverage) of $2.0 million per occurrence. 
 
In brokerage arrangements, our exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by other third-party carriers who haul freight on our behalf is reduced by various factors, including the extent to which the third party providers maintain their own insurance coverage. 
 
Technology
 We use multifaceted software tools and hardware platforms that support seamless integration with the IT networks of our customers and vendors via electronic data exchange systems. These tools enhance our relationships and ability to effectively communicate with customers and vendors. Our tools and platforms provide real-time, web-based visibility into the supply chain of our customers. 
 
We customize our proprietary Warehouse Management System (WMS) to meet the needs of individual customers. It provides the ability to send our customers an advance shipping notice through a simple, web-based interface that can be used by a variety of vendors. It also enables us to clearly identify and communicate to the customer any vendor-related problems that may cause delays to the production line. We also use cross-dock and container return management applications that automate the cycle of material receipt and empty container return. 
 
Our proprietary and third-party transportation management system allows full operational control and visibility from dispatch to delivery, and from invoicing to receivables collections. For our employee drivers, the system provides automated dispatch to hand-held devices, satellite tracking for quality control and electronic status broadcasts to customers when requested. Our international and domestic air freight and ocean forwarding services use similar systems with added functionalities for managing air and ocean freight transportation requirements. All of these systems have customer-oriented web interfaces that allow for full shipment tracking and 
 6


visibility, as well as for customer shipment input. We also provide systems that allow agents to list pending freight shipments and owner-operators with available capacity, and track particular shipments at various points in the shipping route. 
 
We believe that these tools improve our services and quality controls, strengthen our relationships with our customers, and enhance our value proposition. Any significant disruption or failure of these systems could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various U.S. federal and state agencies, as well as comparable agencies in Mexico, Canada, and Colombia. Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to the broad regulatory powers, to include safety and insurance requirements, prescribed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), which is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Such matters as weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to United States federal and state regulation. We operate in the United States, throughout the regions we serve, under operating authority granted by the DOT. We are also subject to regulations relating to testing and specifications of transportation equipment and product handling requirements. In addition, our drivers and owner-operators must have a commercial driver’s license and comply with safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the FMCSA, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing.
 
Our international operations, which include facilities in Mexico, Canada and Colombia and transportation shipments managed by our specialized service operations, are impacted by a wide variety of U.S. government regulations and applicable international treaties. These include regulations of the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department of Treasury. Regulations cover specific commodities, destinations and end-users. A certain portion of our specialized services operations is engaged in the arrangement of imported and exported freight. As such, we are subject to U.S. Customs regulations, which include significant notice and registration requirements. In various Canadian provinces, we operate transportation services under authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications. 
 
Transportation-related regulations are greatly affected by U.S. national security legislation and related regulations. We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable material regulations and that the costs of regulatory compliance are an ordinary operating cost of our business. 
 
Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on, among other things: the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles; fuel storage tanks; transportation of certain materials; and the discharge or retention of storm water. Under specific environmental laws, we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with clean-up of accidents involving our vehicles. We do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, competitive position or capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016. However, future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business.
Seasonality
 Generally, demand for our value-added services delivered to existing customers increases during the second calendar quarter of each year as a result of the automotive industry’s spring selling season and decreases during the third quarter of each year due to the impact of scheduled OEM customer plant shutdowns in July for vacations and changeovers in production lines for new model years. 
 
Our value-added services business is also impacted in the fourth quarter by plant shutdowns during the December holiday period. Prolonged adverse weather conditions, particularly in winter months, can also adversely impact margins due to productivity declines and related challenges meeting customer service requirements. 
 
Our transportation services business is generally impacted by decreased activity during the post-holiday winter season and, in certain states during hurricane season. At these times, some shippers reduce their shipments, and inclement weather impedes trucking operations or underlying customer demand.
