ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 
EXOlifestyle, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “EXO,” or the “Company) was organized as a Nevada corporation on April 5, 2005 under the name Tomi Holdings, Inc. In October 2005, we changed our name to InfraBlue (US), Inc., and in October 2007, changed our name to NextGen Bioscience, Inc. (“NextGen”). NextGen was a biotechnology company focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic proteins. In December 2008, we changed our name to Kalahari Greentech, Inc. (“Kalahari”). Kalahari was a U.S. based minerals exploration company with a primary focus on projects with prior exploration and production history. On May 26, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from Kalahari Greentech, Inc. to PF Hospitality Group, Inc. and effected a 2,000-for-1 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value. All per share amounts and number of shares in the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split.
 
Effective July 1, 2015, we merged with Pizza Fusion Holdings, Inc. (“Pizza Fusion”), a franchisor of organic fare pizza restaurants. As a result of the merger, we became a management firm to create, cultivate, and operate innovative and healthy lifestyle brands within the restaurant and retail industries. Following our December 16, 2015 acquisition of EXO:EXO, Inc., a designer and producer of active wear brands offered in national fitness retailers in the U.S., we sell the “Exosleeve” compression knee sleeves and other active wear products that are utilized in functional athletic fitness, powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting, endurance training, boot camps, circuit training programs, and strength training protocols, and are sold by major online retailers.
 
On December 16, 2015, we acquired EXO:EXO, Inc. (“EXO, Inc.”), a designer and producer of active wear brands offered in national fitness retailers in the U.S. pursuant to the terms of a stock exchange agreement dated December 16, 2015 (the “Stock Exchange Agreement”) with EXO, Inc. and Sloane McComb (EXO, Inc.’s sole shareholder) on December 16, 2015. Pursuant to the Stock Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of EXO, Inc. common stock from Ms. McComb in exchange for (i) the issuance to Ms. McComb of 500,000 shares of our unregistered common stock, (ii) a payment of $25,000 to Ms. McComb, (iii) the payment of up to $20,000 to a third party for the payment of certain debts of EXO, Inc., and (iv) contingent consideration of up to 700,000 shares of our unregistered common stock in the following amounts upon attainment of EXO, Inc. gross sales targets in any calendar year following the closing: 100,000 shares if EXO, Inc. attains gross sales of at least $250,000 but less than $500,000, an additional 150,000 shares if EXO, Inc. attains gross sales of at least $500,000 but less than $750,000, an additional 200,000 shares if EXO, Inc. attains gross sales of at least $750,000 but less than $1,000,000 and an additional 250,000 shares if EXO, Inc. attains gross sales of at least $1,000,000 (the “Contingent Consideration”). In order earn the Contingent Consideration, Ms. McComb must be employed by us for the full calendar year during which the annual performance target has been achieved unless such target has been met prior to her separation. In addition to the purchase price, we agreed to invest $50,000 into EXO, Inc. for inventory, marketing and working capital purposes. Pursuant to the Stock Exchange Agreement, EXO, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary upon the closing of the Stock Exchange.
 
In connection with the closing under the Stock Exchange Agreement, EXO, Inc. entered into an employment agreement with Ms. McComb, pursuant to which Ms. McComb has been engaged as the President of EXO for a term commencing on the closing and ending on December 21, 2018, subject to automatic extensions if neither party has given the other notice that it does not wish to extend the agreement. Ms. McComb will receive an initial salary based on an annual rate to $40,000 for 2016 and $45,000 for 2017 and $50,000 for 2018, and will receive a quarterly bonus equal to 20% EXO, Inc.’s EBITDA in the prior quarter, and other benefits as determined by our board of directors.
 
In connection with our efforts to expand and rebrand our identity, on September 1, 2016 we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our corporate name from PF Hospitality, Inc. to EXOlifestyle, Inc. These actions were approved by our board of directors by written consent in lieu of a meeting on September 1, 2016, and the holders of a majority of our common stock by written consent in lieu of a meeting on September 1, 2016 (the “Written Consent”) in accordance with the relevant sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes. On September 23, 2016, the Amendment of the Articles of Incorporation and the change of our trading symbol to EXOL became effective following approval by the Financial Information Regulatory Association, Inc.

We have three wholly owned operating subsidiaries, each of which is described below:
 

● | EXO:EXO, Inc.: A designer and producer of active wear brands offered in national fitness retailers in the U.S.; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Shaker and Pie, Inc.: Inactive as of September 30, 2016 and subsequently dissolved. 
● | Pizza Fusion Holdings, Inc.: A franchisor of the Pizza Fusion branded restaurants. 

 
We are a designer, marketer and producer of functional sports gear and apparel that is available through various retail outlets worldwide. Our offerings include our original product, an innovative compression knee sleeve collection offered in a variety of custom prints and colorful patterns, knee wraps, wrist wraps, weight belts targeted to the high-performance athletic market including CrossFit®, weightlifting, endurance training, boot camps, circuit training programs, powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting and other strength training protocols. In the past year, we have strategically planned and grown sales in our EXO products from a single-line compression knee sleeve company to a multi-line apparel brand offering wrist wraps, weight belts, apparel and active wear.
 
We derive a portion of our revenue from operating the all-natural and organic pizza franchise, Pizza Fusion, which operates under Pizza Fusion Holdings, Inc.
 
BUSINESS STRATEGY
 
We are focused on developing and marketing consumer fitness products to help people achieve healthier lives. Our products are targeted to meet the needs of a broad range of consumers, including fitness enthusiasts and individuals who are seeking the benefits of regular exercise. We plan to expand our product portfolio of high quality fitness products into multiple product lines utilizing our increasingly recognized brand name, EXO. We are focused on consumer markets and specialty and commercial distribution channels, and view the continual innovation of our product offerings as a key aspect of our business strategy. We are looking to expand our existing product lines by offering new technologies and materials, and focus significant effort and resources on the development or acquisition of innovative new fitness products for introduction to the marketplace at periodic intervals. We intend to continue to increase net revenues by strengthening our position in the sports gear and apparel market and growing our market. Specific elements of our strategy for continued growth include the following:
● Build Our Core Business. The cornerstone of our business has historically been our compression knee sleeve offerings. We are focused on growing that core business with our existing base of retail partners by working to increase exposure and brand awareness while continuing to innovate through quality and technology. We will continue to align ourselves with brand ambassadors in several sports which will enable us to continue to expand our presence in the fitness space. EXO was one of the first compression knee sleeve companies to incorporate custom prints and colors into our designs and this will remain as a focus for seasonal offerings as well. We have seen success in building our B2B customer base and we expect to continue this growth by through expanded relationships with strategic retail partners.
 
● Target Additional Consumer Segments. We continually seek to target new consumer segments for our performance products. We are expanding our offering for women and will be launching a higher-end “activewear” apparel line in Q2 of 2017. This launch is expected to take the brand’s reach well outside our core market of strength training, CrossFit® and weightlifting and open us up to the multi-billion-dollar yoga, Pilates and Zumba® segments. Additionally, we intend to target additional consumers by expanding our direct-to-consumer presence through our website and partners’ retail outlets. We are also developing branded knee sleeve prototypes for various NCAA Division I-A colleges in hopes to not only offer our functional gear to the athletes but to also increase sales through possible licensing agreements with the schools. We are currently working with Ohio State University as our first pilot school.

We have recently launched a sales channel on the Amazon.com market place and we hope we see significant sales growth reaching a much broader customer base through one of the most trusted retailers in the world at Amazon. Amazon will be handing all of the fulfillment, returns and customer feedback through the Fulfillment by Amazon program. Outsourcing this aspect of our business will allow us to allocated human resources to growing other facets of our business.
 
● Broaden Product Offering. We seek to develop and introduce new and innovative products. Through our various existing product lines, we provide branded offerings throughout our retailers’ selling seasons, and we continue to expand these lines to address consumer demands by expanding the fits, styles and colors of our current offerings. We intend to expand our offerings to multiple price points, enabling us to compete more successfully and grow our consumer base. In just the last year alone, our product offerings have grown from a single compression knee sleeve product to a multi-line athletic gear and apparel brand offering wrist wraps, weight belts, apparel and active wear.
● Expand Our Presence Globally. We believe the trend toward performance athletic products is global, and we are working to introduce our products to fitness fanatics throughout the world. Consistent with our domestic branding strategy, we are working with professional athletes and teams to gain more brand awareness in key growth markets. We already do business in Canada, Mexico, UK, UAE, New Zealand and Australia directly with consumers via our website as well as through newly establish retail partnerships. We are targeting Q3 of 2017 to launch our International Amazon marketplaces, opening us up to the world’s largest e-commerce communities. These would be including, but not limited to Amazon Canada, Mexico, UK, Spain, France, Italy and Germany. Q1 of 2018 we will move into the Asian marketplaces. We will utilize a global fulfillment partner, that can scale with our business over time. These planned strategic partnerships will position us for growth without any significant additional overhead.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
According to a report by Allied Market Research titled, “World Sports Apparel - Market Opportunities and Forecasts, 2014-2020”, the world sports apparel market is expected to generate revenue of $184.6 billion by 2020, growing at a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR)of 4.3% during the forecast period, 2015-2020.

According to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association (IHRSA), two significant developments are continuing to drive the growth experienced by the fitness industry: obesity continues in endemic proportions and the healthcare industry continues its trend towards prevention versus treatment. According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control, almost 70% of Americans over the age of 20 are overweight, including 35% that are considered obese according to their November 2015 report. Also, First Lady Michelle Obama developed the Let’s Move program to promote healthy lifestyles in order to curb childhood obesity and improper nutrition. Furthermore, population growth, particularly among individuals aged 20 to 64, which composes the largest gym-going demographic, has also impacted the increased demand for health club memberships, according to IBISworld report dated May 2016. As the focus on exercise and overall healthy lifestyles continue to impact the health club industry, increased availability of health related programing and instruction and increasing spending of sporting goods, we believe the market for compression wear is likely to expand faster than the overall performance apparel category.
 
The use of compression wear has become popular among athletes, and among those who engage in recreational exercise. We believe this is largely as a result of a growing awareness of the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, combined with heavy commercial promotion. Further supporting our belief is the continued increase in U.S. fitness club industry revenues and sporting goods sales. We can benefit from these dynamics as we position ourselves as a top consumer brand of choice within the functional fitness market.
 
SALES
 
We currently sell our products through a number of channels, including business-to-business, through distributors and direct to consumer via our website www.EXOsleeve.com and various sporting events and expos. We actively ship to over 10 countries through relationships with international partners and retailers. We are also actively seeking to establish relationships with select national sporting goods retailers for the sale of our products in their stores.
 
In our business-to-business channel, we sell our products worldwide through a network of retail companies, consisting of sporting goods stores, Internet retailers, small specialty retailers, and independent gyms. Some of our retailers include:

We offer programs that provide price discounts to our retail and wholesale customers for ordering container-sized shipments or placing orders early enough in the season to allow for more efficient manufacturing by our suppliers. These programs are designed to reduce our shipping and handling costs, with much of the savings being passed on to our customers. In addition, we often offer other types of sales incentives to our retail customers, including volume discounts and various forms of rebates or allowances, which generally are intended to increase product exposure and availability for consumers, reduce transportation costs, and encourage marketing and promotion of our brands or specific products.

MARKETING
 
Our marketing efforts are based on an integrated combination of digital and traditional media, social media, event sponsorships, athlete sponsorship/ brand ambassador programs and direct consumer contact. We utilize Internet advertising, product websites, and our sponsored athlete program. Marketing and media effectiveness is measured continuously based on sales inquiries generated, cost-per-lead, conversion rates, return on investment and other performance metrics and we strive to optimize the efficiency of our marketing expenditures based on this data. Almost all of our direct customer orders are received either on our Internet website at www.exosleeve.com. or our Amazon store.
 
Our marketing and promotion efforts begin with a strategy of “seeding” our products among athletes and teams in order to gain recognition through the use of our products “on the field” and in the gym. In addition to the brand recognition and authenticity that this strategy provides, we have entered into endorsement agreements with a limited number of athletes and brand ambassadors with significant social media influence in their respective sports. We also sponsor and/or showcase at several regional and national events. We seek to sponsor these events to drive awareness and brand authenticity from a grassroots level. We have also relied on a well-established social media presence to generate awareness for our products, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube.
 
We intend to focus our marketing strategies on the following areas:
 
Consumer: We will seek to deploy consistent brand messaging and campaigns to build engagement with our consumers using a combination of marketing mediums including but not limited to catalog and digital marketing, social networks, rewards programs, affiliate programs, print, point-of-sale marketing, public relations, and sponsorship and event participation. We expect to utilize these channels to also distribute content, education in our efforts to build the global awareness, purchase intent, conversion, and ultimately, demand through brand loyalty.
 
Athlete Sponsorship Program: We intend to expand our network of influencers brand ambassadors to generate brand awareness.
 
Sponsored Athletes & Brand Ambassadors include:

PRODUCT DESIGN AND INNOVATION
 
Innovation is a vital part of the growth of our business, and we seeking to expand and diversify our product offerings by searching for new innovations that will help us grow our business through higher sales. To accomplish this objective, we seek out ideas and concepts both within our company and from outside designers.
 
As a consumer-driven company, we plan to employ qualitative and quantitative consumer research to help us assess new product concepts. If we determine that a third-party innovation concept meets certain financial criteria, we may enter into a licensing arrangement to utilize the technology or, in certain circumstances, purchase the technology for our own use.
 
SEASONALITY AND VARIABILITY OF BUSINESS
 
EXO. Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the industry, including seasonal weather and discretionary consumer shopping and spending patterns. Our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our sales are weighted substantially toward the third and fourth quarters, while our operating costs are more equally distributed throughout the year. The expansion of our direct-to-consumer operations has increased the proportion of sales, profits and cash flows that we generate in the fourth calendar quarter.

We generally solicit orders from wholesale customers and independent distributors for the fall and spring seasons based on seasonal ordering deadlines that we establish to aid our efforts to plan manufacturing volumes to meet demand. We typically ship the majority of our advance fall season orders to customers beginning in July and continuing through December. Similarly, we typically ship the majority of our advance spring season orders to customers beginning in January and continuing through June. Generally, orders are subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment.
 
Pizza Fusion. We expect that our sales volumes will fluctuate seasonally. We expect that our average sales will be highest in the spring and winter, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall, and that holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some regions. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
 
Generally. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period, particularly in light of persistent volatility in global economic and geopolitical conditions and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates which, when combined with seasonal weather patterns and inflationary or volatile input costs, reduce the predictability of our business.
 
MERCHANDISE SOURCING
 
All of our EXO products are produced by third-party manufacturers, and all of our manufacturing partners were primarily located in China. Lead times for inventory purchases from our suppliers, from order placement to receipt of goods, generally range from approximately 8 to 12 weeks, of which standard transit time represents 3 to 4 weeks. The length of our lead times requires us to place advance manufacturing orders based on management forecasts of future demand for our products. We attempt to compensate for our long replenishment lead times by maintaining adequate levels of inventory.
 
Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally sourced on the basis of individual purchase orders. Our manufacturing relationships are non-exclusive, and we are permitted to procure our products from other sources at our discretion. None of our manufacturing contracts include production volume or purchase commitments on the part of either party. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the sourcing of raw materials and finished products to our specifications.
 
LOGISTICS
 
Our warehouse and distribution facility is located in Boca Raton, Florida . In addition to our Company-operated distribution center, we plan to utilize third-party warehouses and logistics providers to fulfill orders as we expand our operations. In our direct business, we strive to maintain inventory levels that will allow us to ship our products shortly after receiving a customer’s order. We use common carriers for substantially all of our merchandise shipments to direct customers.
 
In our retail business, we manage our inventory levels to accommodate anticipated seasonal changes in demand. Generally, we maintain higher inventory levels at the end of the third and fourth quarters to satisfy relatively higher consumer demand in the fourth and first quarters of each year. Many of our retail customers place orders well in advance of peak periods of consumer demand to ensure an adequate supply for the anticipated selling season.
 
We use various commercial truck lines for our merchandise shipments to retail customers.

COMPETITION
 
EXO. The markets for all of our active wear products are highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors affecting our business are quality, brand recognition, innovation and pricing. We believe we are well positioned to compete in markets in which we can take advantage of our strong brand name, and that our focus on innovative product design, quality, and performance distinguishes our products from the competition.
 
Our products compete directly with those offered by a large number of companies that market consumer active wear apparel. As the use of Internet websites for product sales by traditional retailers has increased, our competitors have become increasingly similar across our Direct and Retail sales channels.
 
Our principal competitors include Rock Tape, Workt, Rehband, Sling Shot and Nike.
 
Pizza Fusion. We believe that our direct competitors in this aspect of our business, pizza restaurants using natural and organic ingredients, constitute a small minority of operators within the pizza industry. We consider anyone in the fast-casual pizza space as competition and consider operators such as Blaze, Pie Five, Modmarket and Zpizza as our direct competitors within the natural and organic market.
 
In addition, the restaurant industry generally is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, brand, attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power. Our franchisees compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. We and our franchisees also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section. In addition, improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quick-service restaurants, together with negative economic conditions, could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.
 
PIZZA FUSION
 
Pizza Fusion was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on November 6, 2006. This company franchises restaurants emphasizing the preparation of food with high quality organic and fresh ingredients for pizza and other menu items. Management has made the determination that its Pizza Fusion hospitality operations are not aligned with the company’s fitness apparel operations.
 
As of September 30, 2016, we franchised a total of 11 Pizza Fusion locations (six in the U.S., two in United Arab Emirates and three in Saudi Arabia. We have seen a reduction of four of the seven locations in Saudi Arabia as a result of weakening demand stemming from reductions in discretionary spending due to continued world-wide reductions in the price of and demand for crude oil. Royalty income was $166,055 as of September 30, 2016, a reduction of $44,678 from the same period in 2015. As a result of these factors, management believes that its resources can be better utilized in its other businesses and is currently evaluating strategic alternatives for its franchise operations including the partial or full sale of its interest in this business. Presently we do not have a timetable for when or if this business will be sold.
 
Franchise and Development Agreements
 
We have historically attempted to sell franchises to third parties, but as of November 2016, the Board of Directors and management of the Company determined not to continue to pursue this line of business. We will continue to be involved in the franchises that we have sold to date, and we will continue to sell license agreements to larger third parties, that will permit these parties to use the “Pizza Fusion” name, trademarks, etc.
 
In connection with our franchising operations, we receive initial franchise fee (typically $30,000), area development fees ( historically $250,000 to $300,000 per territory and a reduced franchise fee per location of $5,000 to $7,500 per location depending on the territory), franchise deposits and royalties of 5% of gross revenues of sales at franchised restaurants as defined in the franchise agreement. The term of the franchise agreement is generally for 10 years and may be renewed for two additional terms of 10 years subject to certain conditions, including the payment of a discounted franchise fee. We are currently operating six stores under franchise agreements.

Under the terms of our franchise agreement, we provide training, opening assistance and an operating manual, have the right to require franchisees source food items, equipment, supplies and certain services from approved suppliers, the right to approve any new menu items and make available to our franchisees information about new developments, techniques, and improvements in the areas of operations, management, and marketing. We also maintain a website for the benefit of ourselves and our franchisees. We have the right, but not the obligation, to establish, maintain, and administer a fund for the marketing of the “Pizza Fusion” brand and restaurants. If we establish a marketing fund, a franchisee is obligated to contribute an amount equal to 3% of its gross revenue for a local marketing fund plus an additional 2% of gross revenue if we establish a regional fund to cover a geographical area we have the right to designate. Further, franchisee’s are obligated to spend an amount equal to 3% of their gross revenues on their own local marketing. We have the right at any time prior to six months before the end of the term of any franchise agreement to inspect a franchised business and require the franchisee to maintain, refurbish, renovate, and upgrade (including purchasing one or more new delivery vehicles).
 
In January 2009, we entered into a ten year area development agreement with a third party to open a total of 10 Pizza Fusion locations in Saudi Arabia in return for a $250,000 development fee. Seven locations have been opened under the terms of this agreement.
 
In March 2011, we entered into a restaurant development agreement with a third party to open a total of 38 Pizza Fusion locations by 2019 in the countries of Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. Two locations have been opened under the terms of this agreement and we have agreed to defer the development schedule under this agreement indefinitely. This development agreement expires on December 31, 2023.
 
The natural and organic food industry has grown significantly since we created the concept in 2006. A majority of the products needed to provide natural and organic offerings are readily available through national distribution partners as well as regional and local distribution sources. Fluctuations in commodity costs are expected, are present in all restaurant concepts, and are not unique to operators of natural and organic restaurant concepts. We endeavor to monitor the market pricing of our major commodity items, such as tomatoes, cheese and flour, and seek to secure long-term contracts based on futures pricing. Notwithstanding these efforts, fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly when prices increase precipitously, could adversely affect the operations of our franchisees.
 
Other Agreements
 
As disclosed in the Company’s Form 8-K filed on September 20, 2016, on September 15, 2016, the Company and Midam Ventures, LLC (“Consultant”) entered into an Engagement Letter pursuant to which the Consultant shall provide to the Company, among other services, the following services: (i) investor relations and public relations, (ii) product marketing; (iii) product development; (iv) product awareness, (v) business advisory and consulting services for the purpose of creating market awareness, etc. (the “Services”). As consideration for the Services, the Company is obligated to pay to Consultant a total of $150,000 cash compensation, payable $75,000 on or before September 19, 2016 and $75,000 no later than September 30, 2016. The term of the agreement is six weeks, with the first two weeks to be dedicated to a “ramp up period” and the remaining four weeks to be dedicated to “marketing”. In addition, the agreement contains customary terms relating to payment of expenses, confidentiality, indemnification and other matters. The agreement expired in accordance with its terms on October 30, 2016.
Research and Development
 
We do not engage in any material research and development activities. However, we do engage in ongoing studies to assist with food and menu development. Additionally, we conduct consumer research to determine customers’ preferences, trends, and opinions, as well as to better understand other competitive brands.

Government Regulation
 
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and international laws governing franchise sales and the franchise relationship. In general, these laws and regulations impose certain disclosure and registration requirements prior to the offer and sale of franchises. Each of our franchisees’ restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The development and operation of restaurants depends on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, alcoholic beverage control, traffic and other regulations.
Seasonality
 
We expect that our sales volumes will fluctuate seasonally. We expect that our average sales will be highest in the spring and winter, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall, and that holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some regions. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Trademarks and Service Marks
 
We own the service marks for “Pizza Fusion” and “Pizza Fusion Fresh, Organic Earth Friendly”. These service marks are registered in the United States. We granted our area franchisee in the Middle East the right to register the Pizza Fusion trademark for the term of its franchise agreement with us in certain countries in the Middle East where the franchisee has the right to open Pizza Fusion restaurants. We expect that the service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses will have significant value and be important to our marketing efforts. Registration of the Pizza Fusion and Pizza Fusion Fresh, Organic Earth Friendly service marks expire in our 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively, unless renewed. We expect to renew these registrations at the appropriate time.
Employees
 
As of January 3, 2017, we had six full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement dated July 27, 2015, we issued and sold a $1,333,334 principal amount of convertible debentures due July 27, 2020 for a price of $1,200,000. Proceeds from this debenture will be paid to the company as follows: $140,000 upon signing with the balance payable in five consecutive monthly installments of $212,000 commencing on September 1, 2015. The company agreed to pay interest for the first 12 months at the rate of 10% per annum on the amounts advanced payable in cash in six equal tranches, the first of which is due on date the company closed on the financing and remainder will be due on each of the first five monthly anniversaries of such date. As of September 30, 2016, $477,000 has been advanced under this debenture and we are in discussions with the investors about the timing for resumption of payments of the remaining $723,000 due.

Under the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement entered into as part of the offering, the company agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 60 days of the closing date covering the public resale of the shares of common stock underlying the debentures, and to use its best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days from the closing date. Should the number of shares of common stock the company is permitted to include in the initial registration statement be limited pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, the company further agreed to file additional registration statements with the SEC to register any remaining shares. We will pay all costs associated with the registration statements, other than underwriting commissions and discounts. The parties to the Registration Rights Agreement have agreed to defer our obligation to file a registration statement until further notice by the holders of the convertible debt.
 
The terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement contain certain negative covenants by the company, unless consent of purchasers holding at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debentures, including prohibitions on: incurrence of certain indebtedness and liens, amendment to our articles of incorporation or bylaws, repayment or repurchase of the company’s common stock or debts, sell substantially all of its assets or merger with another entity, pay cash dividends or enter into any related party transactions. We granted investors certain pro-rata rights of first refusal on future offerings by the company for as long as the investor(s) beneficially own any of the debentures.
 
The debentures are convertible into shares of the company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 65% of the lowest traded price of its common stock for the twenty trading days prior to each conversion date subject to adjustment. The conversion price of the debentures is subject to proportional adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and similar corporate events. In addition, the conversion price is subject to adjustment if the company issues or sells shares of its common stock for a consideration per share less than the conversion price then in effect, or issue options, warrants or other securities convertible or exchange for shares of its common stock at a conversion or exercise price less than the conversion price of the debentures then in effect. If either of these events should occur, the conversion price is reduced to the lowest price at which these securities were issued or are exercisable. The debentures shares are not convertible to the extent that (a) the number of shares of the company’s common stock beneficially owned by the holder and (b) the number of shares of the company’s common stock issuable upon the conversion of the debentures or otherwise would result in the beneficial ownership by holder of more than 4.99% of the company’s then outstanding common stock. This ownership limitation can be increased or decreased to any percentage not exceeding 9.99% by the holder upon 61 days’ notice to the company.
 
On July 26, 2016, in conjunction with the funding of $50,000 under the convertible debentures by one of the holders of the convertible notes, we entered into an agreement with all of the holders of such notes to amend the conversion price to equal 50% of the lowest traded price of our common stock for the twenty trading days prior to each conversion date subject to adjustment. In addition, our Chief Executive Office, Vaughn Dugan and its President, Randy Romano, agreed to pledge as collateral for the Convertible Debt 4,800,000 and 4,920,873 shares, respectively, of our common stock they own to the investor who funded the $50,000 payment. The number of shares pledged are subject to reduction in an amount equal to the reduction in the principal amount of the convertible debentures held by the investor divided by $55,555.55 (plus interest on such amount which accrues commencing on the date of the Convertible Debenture) and multiplying the result by the number of pledged shares until the number of pledged shares is zero (the “Pledged Share Reduction”). The Pledged Share Reduction shall be computed no less frequently than within 30 days after the last day of each fiscal quarter.
 
July 20, 2016 Financing
 
On July 20, 2016 we issued a $200,000.00 principal amount convertible debenture due July 20, 2021 (the “Convertible Debenture”) which we sold at par value to an unrelated third party investor (the “Investor”). The terms of the Convertible Debenture include:

--


Maturity Date, Interest and Prepayment. The principal amount of the Convertible Note and accrued interest shall have been paid no later than November 30, 2020 (the “Maturity Date”). The note bears interest at an annual rate of 10.00% on the principal balance. Interest shall be accrued and added to the principal amount of the Convertible Note. The principal amount and any accrued interest due under the Convertible Note may be prepaid, in whole or in part at any time upon ten days written notice to the Investor. If the Company exercises its right to prepay any portion of the Convertible Note, the Company shall make payment to the Investor of an amount in cash equal to the sum of the then outstanding principal amount of this Convertible Debenture being prepaid and accrued interest thereon multiplied by 130%.
 
Optional Conversion. The Investor may at any time convert the amount due under the Convertible Debenture into shares of common stock (“Conversion Shares”) at a conversion price (“Conversion Price”) equal to the product of 50% multiplied by the lowest traded price of the Common Stock for the twenty trading days prior to the conversion date subject to adjustment as noted below.
 
Ownership Limitations. The Convertible Debenture is not convertible to the extent that (a) the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the Investor and (b) the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Convertible Debenture or otherwise would result in the beneficial ownership by Investor of more than 4.99% of our then outstanding common stock. This ownership limitation can be increased or decreased to any percentage not exceeding 9.99% by the Investor upon 61 days’ notice to us.
 
Certain Adjustments and Subsequent Rights Offerings. The conversion price of the Convertible Debenture is subject to proportional adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and similar corporate events. In addition, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any common stock equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Company’s Common Stock (the “Purchase Rights”), then the Investor will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Investor could have acquired if the Investor had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of the Convertible Debenture (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the beneficial ownership limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record Investors of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, to the extent that the Investor’s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Investor exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation, then the Investor shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Investor until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Investor exceeding the beneficial ownership limitation).
 
Negative Covenants. As long as the Convertible Debenture is outstanding, unless the holders of at least 75% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Debenture shall have otherwise given prior written consent, we agreed that we will not amend our charter documents and bylaws in any manner that materially and adversely affects any rights of the holder, repurchase our common stock or certain other securities, pay dividends or distributions on any securities junior to the Convertible Debenture, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any significant portion of our assets outside the ordinary course of business, enter into any related party transactions or enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.
 
Pledge of Shares. Pursuant to the terms of a stock pledge agreement, our Chief Executive Office, Vaughn Dugan and its President, Randy Romano, agreed to pledge as collateral for the Convertible Debt 19,200,000 and 19,683,492 shares, respectively, of our common stock they own to the Investor. The number of shares pledged are subject to reduction in an amount equal to the reduction in the principal amount of the Convertible Debentures held by Investor divided by $200,000.00 (plus interest on such amount which accrues commencing on the date of the Convertible Debenture) and multiplying the result by the number of pledged shares until the number of pledged shares is zero (the “Pledged Share Reduction”). The Pledged Share Reduction shall be computed no less frequently than within 30 days after the last day of each fiscal quarter.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
