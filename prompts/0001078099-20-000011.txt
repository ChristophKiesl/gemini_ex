ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Company Overview
The Meet Group, Inc. (“Company,” “The Meet Group,” “us” or “we”) is a leading provider of interactive live-streaming solutions.  We leverage a powerful live video platform (“Live”), empowering our global community to forge meaningful connections. Our primary applications (“apps”) are MeetMe®, LOVOO®, Skout®, Tagged® and Growlr®.
We operate location-based social networks for meeting new people — primarily on mobile platforms, including on iPhone, Android, iPad and other tablets — that facilitate interactions among users and encourage users to connect, communicate and engage with each other. Over the past three years we have transformed our business from an advertising-based revenue model to one where the majority of our revenue is derived from user pay monetization and subscriptions. The fastest-growing component of user pay monetization comes from in-app purchases, including virtual gifts associated with Live.
We began developing Live in 2016 with the belief that we could successfully pair live streaming and dating — a model that we had seen work effectively for Asian dating app providers. We first launched Live on the MeetMe app in early 2017, and, in October 2017, we began to monetize the feature by enabling virtual gifting within live video broadcasts. During this time period, we also executed on our strategy of acquiring other properties — Skout, Inc. (“Skout”), Ifwe, Inc. (“if(we)”) and LOVOO GmbH (“LOVOO”) — where we believed Live would fit naturally. We launched the monetized version of Live on the Skout app in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Tagged app in the second quarter of 2018 and the LOVOO app in the second quarter of 2018. We have also continued to add features and enhancements intended to drive video engagement and increase monetization across all of our apps, and we intend to launch and monetize Live on the Growlr app — which we acquired in 2019 as part of our acquisition of Initech LLC (“Initech”) — in 2020. Live has become the fastest-growing revenue product in our history.
Looking ahead, we intend to leverage Live by making it available to third-party apps (and users of third-party apps) as a video-as-a-service platform (“vPaaS”). With vPaaS, we intend that users of Live will appear on and be able to interact with users of other mobile apps and vice versa, leading to mutually-beneficial revenue-share arrangements with the owners of these other third-party apps.
We also offer online marketing capabilities, which enable marketers to display their advertisements on our apps. We offer significant scale to our advertising partners, delivering more than 10 billion monthly advertising impressions across our active global user base, and sophisticated programmatic strategies for effective targeting. We work with advertising partners to maximize the effectiveness of their campaigns by optimizing advertisement formats and placements for maximum performance and return on investment.
Just as Facebook has established itself as the social network of friends and family, and LinkedIn has established itself as the social network of colleagues and business professionals, we have created the social entertainment network not of the people you know, but of the people you want to know. Nimble, fast-moving and already in more than 100 countries, we are differentiating ourselves from other dating brands with Live, which is not offered by many of our direct competitors. Modeled after the live video platforms offered by Asian dating app providers, but enhanced in order to appeal to Western audiences, Live is aimed at the nexus of entertainment and community, where we believe our apps exhibit a natural strength.
Our vision extends beyond dating and entertainment. We focus on building quality products to satisfy the universal need for human connection among all people, everywhere — not just paying subscribers. We believe meeting new people is a basic human need, especially for users aged 18 to 34, when so many long-lasting relationships are made. We use advanced technology to engineer serendipitous connections among people who otherwise might never have met — a sort of digital coffeehouse, where everyone belongs. Over the years, our apps have originated untold numbers of chats, shares, good friendships, dates and romantic relationships — even marriages.
We believe we have significant growth opportunities enabled through our social entertainment platform. We believe our scale provides unique advantages to grow video monetization, while also establishing a high density of users within the geographic regions we serve. As our networks grow and the number of users in a location increases, we believe that users who are seeking to meet new people will incrementally benefit from the quantity of relevant connections.

Business Overview
How We Create Value for Users
We provide something we feel everyone craves — the magic of human connection. Through Live and our pipeline of new products, such as virtual gifting, we are helping to connect a portion of the over 50 million people aged 18 to 34 in the U.S., and the more than one billion people aged 18 to 34 worldwide. We offer a range of free and subscription-based services to our users, which we monetize through direct user purchases including video, subscription and other in-app products as well as through advertising. In 2019, we generated approximately 69% of our revenue from user pay sources.
People use our apps to make friends, socialize, date, be entertained and chat. In fact, in our internal survey of MeetMe users conducted in January 2019, 83% of those responding said they preferred to start relationships as friends. We believe this comfort level drives higher engagement and retention.
We believe we are well positioned to continue to grow user engagement and generate revenue with Live, and our continued execution against an aggressive product pipeline. We believe new video products not only have the potential to attract new users, but also to grow monetization per user.
More than 4.8 million people used our apps and websites, on average, every day as of the quarter ended December 31, 2019, to meet new people in their local communities and throughout the world. In many cases they are logging in multiple times per day in order to interact with other users and engage in live video broadcasts. Approximately 20% of our mobile users engage with Live each day, and we are seeing increasing video monetization across our apps. Not only are users being entertained, but many are also meeting friends, significant others and potential spouses every day.
Our apps offer a variety of ways for users to discover and interact with one another, with Live increasingly becoming a core medium of connection.
The most popular feature on our apps has traditionally been one-on-one chat, and users spend much of their time with us interacting with the connections they have made on our apps. Our primary “magic” is not chat itself, but the ease with which our users can find new people with whom to chat. Our chat service is generally provided free to all users; however, the LOVOO app limits the number of chats that a user can send for free and provides for the ability to unlock additional chats with a paid subscription or in-app purchase.
There are four key features we offer to facilitate connections between users: “Browse,” “Swipe,” “Feed” and Live.
The most direct is a Browse feature, which allows users to peruse profiles and photos of potential connections nearby or around the world. We use sophisticated, data-backed algorithms to prioritize the most relevant recommendations for each user.
For users interested in a quicker, more-gamified experience, each of our apps offers a Swipe feature, which allows users to, in effect, swipe left and right on potential matches based on their photos and limited profile information. When two users express interest in one another in Swipe, we notify each one of the match and encourage them to chat. We believe the double-sided match requirement causes these conversations to be significantly more efficient, but somewhat less frequent, than those that come from a Browse feature.
We also enable users, on apps other than the LOVOO app, to discover and connect with one another around content, including both text and photo posts, within our Feed feature. In this model, rather than browsing profiles, users are browsing content created by other users, either nearby or around the world. This content offers a compelling jumping-off point for extended conversation, both public (in the form of comments on that content) and private (in the form of one-on-one chats that subsequently develop).
In 2017, we began an aggressive push into live video, adding Live — which we believe to be both an engaging and highly- monetizable format for communication and social entertainment — on the MeetMe and Skout apps. We added similar functionality to our Tagged and LOVOO apps in 2018 and expect to do the same for the Growlr app in 2020. We also added several new features within Live, including “Viewer Levels,” “Streamer Levels” and other forms of user status and gamification, as well as “NextDate,” a feature that more-tightly integrates the live-streaming and dating components of our apps to broaden the audience for Live.

The one-to-many live-streaming feature of Live enables our users to become performers, gain an audience, cultivate relationships with their top fans and earn cash rewards if they produce engaging content and spend enough time on our platforms. The most popular broadcasters interact directly with their live audience on our apps, even allowing audience members to join their streams as guest broadcasters. Audience members can make in-app purchases to show their appreciation with virtual gifts to broadcasters. Monetization of Live is done primarily through virtual gifting. In our one-to-many live-streaming feature, a single broadcaster on one of our apps can entertain and interact with what is essentially an unlimited number of viewers. Gifting enables those viewers to use virtual credits purchased through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store to send the broadcaster a virtual gift as a show of appreciation or interest for that entertainment.
Each of our apps also offers a subscription service for those users who want to have the very best experience and the most options available to them. Benefits for subscribers vary across the portfolio, but include additional advanced filters, suppression of advertisements, permanent access to information or features otherwise locked and increased or eliminated limits on functionality such as daily icebreakers or Swipe gameplay.
Finally, users can also make in-app purchases in other features within the apps, typically either to unlock content or functionality or to prioritize their profiles or content within the apps. For example, users can spend Credits, Points or Gold for promotion within the Browse and Feed features, which garners them more attention with the goal of allowing them to find more connections more quickly. As another example, users may purchase the ability to unlock the list of who has viewed their profile or who has expressed an interest in them.
How We Create Value for Advertisers
We believe our large and highly-engaged audience means significant scale for advertisers and makes our apps an attractive platform for advertisers of all sizes. We focus on providing a wide variety of advertising products that drive our users to engage with brands. Through leading mobile programmatic advertising strategies and our highly-desirable and hard-to-reach Millennial and Generation Z audiences, we can pinpoint users that can no longer be found through traditional channels due to cord-cutting and mobile-first media consumption. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we served over 10 billion advertising impressions each month across our mobile apps and websites.
Our Strategy
We are executing on our core mission of meeting the universal need for human connection with a focus on Live, while diversifying our revenue base toward user pay revenue such as subscriptions and in-app purchases as we scale our business and strive to grow revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), our primary performance measures.
Our strategy for 2020 and beyond is aimed at growing our audience, expanding our video offerings and engaging our active user base to drive monetization. 
The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Strengthen the Core: Having transformed our business to a primarily user pay model, a key area of our focus is to strengthen the core social entertainment business we have built. This includes developing and delivering new video products, including Viewer Levels, Streamer Levels and NextDate, enhancing user experience and improving operational execution across our business. As we look ahead, we are focused on increasing authenticity and user safety through ramped-up user verification programs, as well as product improvements to core components like “Profile” and “Chat.” We will continue to gamify live-streaming with new features, contests and fresh content, including “Date Night,” which bridges the online experience of NextDate with real-world dating. We believe strengthening our core business will improve user monetization and grow revenue. 


• | Expand into Adjacencies: Beyond our current user base, we see opportunities to leverage our social entertainment platform to expand into new user groups, adjacencies and niches, both organically and inorganically. We acquired and integrated four businesses in the 2016 to 2019 time frame, and have successfully brought Live to each acquired app, with the exception of the Growlr app, which we expect to do in 2020. We expect to enter new markets, including, for example, additional geographies, to build scale and create value. Additional opportunities include the development and delivery of stand-alone apps with a non-dating focus as well as geographic expansion. 


• | Grow Margins: We will continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies and margins, while investing in growth from new products.

Product Development
We are continually developing new products, as well as optimizing our existing platforms and feature sets in order to meet the evolving needs of our user base and advertising partners.
We develop most of our software internally. We will, however, purchase technology and license intellectual property rights where it is strategically important, operationally compatible or economically advantageous. For instance, we partner with third parties for video and to further our internationalization efforts as we look to bring additional languages into our existing platforms. We are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to product development. We work with third-party payment providers as part of our video monetization product.
Our technology team consists of approximately 190 employees for our product development and engineering team, our database administration team, our quality assurance team and our network system operators as of December 31, 2019. These teams are responsible for feature enhancements and general maintenance across all of our platforms. Our technology team is headquartered in New Hope, Pennsylvania, with additional offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, San Francisco, California and Dresden, Germany.
Sales, Marketing and Operations
We have grown our user base through organic, viral channels as well as through acquisitions. By encouraging members to invite their friends to join our apps and to share their activity across other external platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, and by providing members with easy-to-use tools, we believe we have successfully grown our user base while minimizing marketing costs. We focus primarily on creating a truly differentiated experience and compelling value proposition for new users in our markets and developing the technologies needed to facilitate their word-of-mouth marketing on our behalf in order to attract and retain new members.
Our paid customer acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring users in geographies where we believe we will see a return on our acquisition investment. We spent $27.6 million, $25.6 million and $15.8 million on paid direct user acquisition for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, or 13.1%, 14.3% and 12.8% of our total revenue, respectively.  
Our sales and marketing team consists of approximately 40 employees in the U.S. and Germany as of December 31, 2019 and covers major brand agencies, direct response and cost-per-action engagement advertisers, advertising networks and mobile agencies. Our advertising operations are headquartered in New Hope, Pennsylvania, with additional offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, San Francisco, California, Dresden, Germany and Berlin, Germany.
Our member services team consists of approximately 50 employees in New Hope, Pennsylvania and Dresden, Germany, and approximately 500 contractors split between Delhi, India and Bangalore, India as of December 31, 2019. This team is responsible for reviewing images and other user-generated content, investigating and responding to member abuse reports and providing general customer support.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property includes trademarks related to our brands, products and services, copyrights in software and creative content, patents, trade secrets, domain names and other intellectual property rights and licenses of various kinds. We seek to protect our intellectual property through trademark and other laws of the U.S. and other countries, and through contractual provisions.
We consider the MeetMe, Skout, Tagged, Hi5, LOVOO, Growlr and Social Theater trademarks and our related trademarks to be valuable to us, and we have registered these trademarks in the U.S. and other countries throughout the world and aggressively seek to protect them.
Competition
We operate at the forefront of nascent segments (social discovery and social entertainment) of a broader sector that is still being defined (social networking). As such, we face significant competition in every aspect of our business, both from established companies whose products help users meet new people, or are evolving to do so, and from smaller but well-funded startups that can quickly gain attention and compete with us for users.
4


Example of services that compete with us for users and advertiser interest include, but are not limited to:

• | mobile apps and websites whose primary focus is to help users meet new people in their geographical area, including Badoo, Twoo and Meetup;


• | social networking mobile apps and websites with a focus on dating, which is a subset of the opportunity around meeting new people, such as Zoosk, Match, Happn, PlentyOfFish, OkCupid and Tinder;


• | other video platforms that provide one-to-many and one-to-one video services such as live.me, TikTok, Azar, Younow, Bigo, Twitch and Periscope; and


• | broader social networks that currently offer or may evolve to offer services aimed at helping users meet new people in their area, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.

As we introduce new products, and as other companies introduce new products and services, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our competition is included in “Part I, Item 1A— Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”).
In addition to other online dating and social networking brands, we compete indirectly with offline dating services, such as matchmakers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 330 employees, most of whom are full-time in the U.S. and Germany. Our future success is substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management and key technical personnel, as well as our continuing ability to attract, maintain the caliber of and retain highly-qualified technical and managerial personnel. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our employees is included in “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Government Regulations
In the U.S., advertising and promotional information presented to visitors on our mobile apps and websites and our other marketing activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices. There are a variety of state and federal restrictions on the marketing activities conducted by email, or over the Internet, including U.S. federal and state privacy laws and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2001 (“CAN-SPAM Act”), the Illinois Biometric Privacy Act of 2008 (“BIPA”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). The CCPA took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposes stringent data privacy and data protection requirements for the data of California residents and may require us to make new disclosures to consumers about our data collection, use and sharing practices. We may also be subject to laws in the various other countries in which we operate, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GPDR”), which came into effect in most of Europe on May 25, 2018. These rules and regulations are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by courts or other governmental authorities. We may unintentionally violate such laws, such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments (or developments stemming from the enactment or modification of other laws) or the failure to anticipate accurately the application or interpretation of these laws could create liability to us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business. Additional information regarding certain risks related to government regulations is included in “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
