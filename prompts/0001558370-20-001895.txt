ITEM 1.BUSINESS
​
We are a leading provider of solutions in Earth intelligence and space infrastructure. We help government and commercial customers monitor, understand and navigate the changing planet; deliver global broadband communications infrastructure; and explore and advance the use of space. Our approach combines decades of deep mission understanding and a proven commercial and defense foundation to deliver our services with speed, scale and cost effectiveness. Our stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “MAXR”.
On January 1, 2019, we completed a reorganization of our corporate structure pursuant to which we directly acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Maxar Technologies Ltd. (“Maxar Canada”), and we replaced Maxar Canada as the publicly-held parent company of the Maxar group (“U.S. Domestication”). Prior to U.S. Domestication, Maxar Canada reported to securities regulators in both Canada and the U.S., financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Upon completion of the U.S. Domestication, and including the report herein, we have prepared our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The U.S. Domestication marked a major milestone in Maxar Canada’s long-term objectives to gain a stronger presence in the U.S. market (the “U.S. Access Plan”), enhance Maxar Canada’s ability to provide and support classified applications for U.S. government agencies, and fulfill a commitment made in connection with the acquisition of DigitalGlobe, Inc. (“DigitalGlobe”) on October 5, 2017 (“DigitalGlobe Transaction”). 
​
The DigitalGlobe Transaction created a company that we believe is uniquely positioned to capture growth in the U.S. and global Earth observation and geospatial services markets given its ability to provide complete, end-to-end space systems, Earth imagery and geospatial solutions. The DigitalGlobe Transaction leveraged a full range of space-related capabilities, including communications and Earth observation satellites and robotics, integrated electro-optical imagery, and advanced data analytics. As a result of the combination, we are able to deliver cloud-based information services that allow commercial and government customers worldwide to better understand activity across the changing planet.
​
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell MDA, our Canadian subsidiary, to a consortium of private investors led by Northern Private Capital, for C$1 billion subject to customary adjustments and regulatory approvals (“MDA Transaction”). We expect to use the net proceeds to repay debt and improve our capital structure to prioritize investments for growth in our core areas of Earth Intelligence and Space Infrastructure. The MDA Transaction includes all of MDA’s business, encompassing ground stations, radar satellite products, robotics, defense and satellite components, representing approximately 1,900 employees. As a result of this announcement, this business, whose results were previously the MDA segment (described below), was classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on this transaction, as well as Note 17 - Segment Information and Note 4– Discontinued Operations in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding the Company’s segments and discontinued operations. Except as otherwise noted, the description of our business and financial information reflects our continuing operations. See Note 4, “Discontinued Operations” in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on key leadership changes.
​
The MDA Transaction further executed on our near-term priority of reducing debt. We also believe the transaction will place us in a better position to take advantage of substantial growth opportunities across Earth Intelligence and Space Infrastructure categories. 
​
Segments
​
On January 13, 2019, Mr. Daniel Jablonsky was appointed as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Maxar.

In connection with Mr. Jablonsky’s appointment in January 2019 and President and Chief Executive Officer of Maxar, our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) also changed. During 2019, Mr. Jablonsky rolled out a transformative plan to integrate, stabilize, and position Maxar for future growth. As part of this plan, we streamlined our operating structure to reflect a more efficient model and integrated our existing business units so that they are more aligned and collaborative. This resulted in a change in the evaluation of our business by our CODM, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The changes to our segments align our business units to our future growth strategy. The CODM reviews revenue and Adjusted EBITDA based on three reportable segments: Earth Intelligence, Space Infrastructure and MDA. In connection with the MDA Transaction discussed above, the MDA segment was classified as discontinued operations as of the year ended December 31, 2019. Comparative historical segmented information has been restated. Refer to Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed disclosure of revenues and Adjusted EBITDA by segment.

The following is a description of our business segments. As part of the description, we include a discussion on some of the segment’s notable announcements and achievements in 2019. 
​
Earth Intelligence
​
We are a global leader in high resolution space-based optical and radar imagery products and analytics. We launched the world’s first high resolution commercial imaging satellite in 1999 and currently operate a four-satellite imaging constellation, providing us with a 110 petabyte historical ImageLibrary of the highest-resolution, commercially available imagery. Our imagery solutions provide customers with timely, accurate and mission-critical information about our changing planet and support a wide variety of government and commercial applications, including mission planning, mapping and analysis, environmental monitoring, disaster management, crop management, oil and gas exploration and infrastructure management. Our principal customers in the Earth Intelligence segment are U.S. and other international government agencies (primarily defense and intelligence agencies), as well as a wide variety of commercial customers in multiple markets. We are a market leader in the commercial satellite Earth observation industry. 
​
We also provide geospatial services that combine imagery, analytic expertise and innovative technology to deliver intelligence solutions to customers. Our cleared developers, analysts, and data scientists provide analytic solutions that accurately document change and enable geospatial modeling and analysis that help predict where events will occur. Our primary customer of geospatial services is the U.S. government, but we also support intelligence requirements for other U.S. allied governments, global development organizations and commercial customers. The Earth Intelligence segment includes the financial results of the legacy imagery and services segments, excluding the legacy Canadian radar imagery business which is part of the MDA segment. 
​
Customers can purchase specific images from our imagery archives or place custom orders to task our satellites for a specific area of interest. We process our imagery to varying levels according to our customers’ specifications and deliver

our products using the distribution method that best suits our customers’ needs. We offer a number of imagery products, including:

• | Orthorectified imagery—includes radiometric, geometric and topographic correction. Topographic correction accounts for terrain and projects images onto the Earth as they would be seen by the human eye.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mosaic products—powered by our proprietary image processing techniques, our mosaic products deliver high-quality imagery through thousands of combined images that maximizes contrast, sharpness, and clarity. We also sell mosaic products that deliver regular updates of images of 6,000 major metropolitan areas.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Elevation products—elevation and terrain information is foundational to mapping and understanding the surface of our planet. We offer stereo imagery, which is when the satellite sensor acquires multiple images of the same location taken from different angles, allowing our customers to create three-dimensional visualization and digital elevation models.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Information products—new vector information products are derived from our imagery archive using machine learning without additional processing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SecureWatch—a subscription offering that provides customers online access to an extensive imagery and geospatial intelligence platform and addresses a broad spectrum of uses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We also provide certain customers the ability to directly task and receive imagery from our satellites within local and regional geographic boundaries of interest through our Direct Access Program (“DAP”). We sell these customers ground system infrastructure, enabling them to download and process imagery directly from our satellites and access to our satellite and maintenance services. The DAP is designed to meet the enhanced information and operational security needs of a select number of international defense and intelligence customers and certain commercial customers. Our Rapid Access Program offers customers access to our satellite constellation, while we own and manage the ground infrastructure.
​
We provide advanced geospatial information, applications, and analytic services to national security and commercial customers through our imagery and other sources of geospatial data such as low-resolution satellite imagery, weather and oceanographic data, elevation, and social media. We deploy these services through various platforms, including Amazon Web Services and NVIDIA. Our 65 active patents and SBIR Phase III data rights support the unique technology we provide to our customers.
​
As of December 31, 2019, we operated a constellation of four in-orbit and fully-commissioned satellites: GeoEye-1, WorldView-1, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3. Our annual collection capacity is approximately 1.4 billion square kilometers, and we have collected approximately 110 petabytes of imagery over our history (referred to as our “ImageLibrary”), which is available for use.

​
Our satellites have advanced technical capabilities, such as size of collection area, collection speed, revisit time, resolution, accuracy and spectral diversity.
​
In December 2018, our WorldView-4 satellite experienced a failure in its control moment gyros, preventing the satellite from collecting imagery. We received insurance proceeds of $183 million related to our loss of WorldView-4 during the second quarter of 2019. Refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the WorldView-4 loss. 
​
We procure insurance to protect us from the risks associated with our satellite operations, including the partial or total impairment of the functional capacity of the satellite. We insure satellites in our constellation to the extent that insurance is available at acceptable premiums. As of December 31, 2019, we maintained the following insurance coverage on our in-orbit and fully-commissioned satellite constellation:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

for our Global Enhanced Geospatial Delivery service, which allows us to continue providing more than a quarter million U.S. government users with access to this program. Lastly, in the fourth quarter, we were selected by the U.S. Air Force to develop Red Wing, an automated cloud-based geospatial intelligence analysis architecture for the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
​
Our major existing and potential competitors for our Earth Intelligence business include commercial satellite imagery companies, state-owned imagery providers, aerial imagery companies, free sources of imagery, unmanned aerial vehicles, and companies that provide geospatial analytic information and services to the U.S. government, including defense prime contractors. 
​
We compete on the basis of the technical capabilities of our satellites, such as size of collection area, collection speed, revisit time, resolution, accuracy and spectral diversity; satellite availability for tasked orders; the size, comprehensiveness and relevance of our ImageLibrary; distribution platform and tools that enable customers to easily access and integrate imagery; value-added services, including advanced imagery production and analysis; timeliness and ready availability of imagery products and services that can be deployed quickly and cost-effectively; and price.
​
Space Infrastructure
​
We are a leading provider of Space Infrastructure. We design, build, integrate and test solutions for space-based communications satellites, on-orbit servicing, robotic assembly, and space exploration. We address a broad spectrum of needs for our customers, including mission systems engineering, product design, spacecraft manufacturing, assembly integration and testing. We provide advanced, reliable, and affordable spacecraft that enable our commercial customers to deliver valuable global services, and we are successfully partnering with the U.S. government in new space opportunities. The Space Infrastructure segment includes the financial results of our legacy Space Solutions business (previously referred to as Space Systems/Loral LLC or SSL) which was included within our legacy Space Systems segment. 
​
We have built and launched more than 280 spacecraft with a combined approximate 2,600 years of on-orbit service. We have more than 30 years of experience in space robotics, having developed all five robotic arms on the Mars landers and rovers. 
Our products include:

• | Communications and imaging satellites and payloads;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Space platforms for power, propulsion, and communication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Satellite ground systems and support services;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Space-based and airborne remote sensory solutions;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Space robotics; and
--+--------------------


• | Defense systems.
--+-----------------

We have 92 satellites currently on orbit with 99.9998% availability.
​
The Space Infrastructure manufacturing capability of satellite vehicles (commonly referred to as a “satellite bus” or a “bus”) consists of the heritage 1300 bus (which spans a broad capability ranging from 1300 to over 6500 kg) and the smaller Legion-class bus 9which spans a range from 500 to 1300 kg). Our Legion-class bus involves a new modular architecture with mission-specific subsystems selectable from our wide range of heritage and newly developed products. 
​
The 1300 bus has three decades of on-orbit heritage and is highly versatile, serving a wide range of missions, orbits and customers. The 1300 bus is the world’s most popular Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (“GEO”) satellite, designed to accommodate evolutionary technology advances. It was one of the first spacecraft platforms to provide solar electric propulsion, or SEP, and has been used to demonstrate next-generation technologies including Q/V-band, photonics and a payload orbital delivery system, or PODS, that brings small free-flying spacecraft to GEO. The largest application class 

7



for which the 1300 bus has historically been utilized is commercial geostationary communication satellites and recently as a host for NASA payloads, such as TEMPO (defined below). Our 1300 bus is in use today for a broad range of television distribution services from smaller regional television satellites to the high-capacity, high-power satellites used by direct-to-home television distributors. A more recently emerging and growing application for commercial geostationary communication satellites is the delivery of data-centric applications (such as consumer broadband, in-flight communication, maritime and 4G/5G cellular backhaul) via high-capacity spot beam satellites commonly referred to as “high throughput satellites” (or “HTS”). Space Infrastructure introduced the first HTS satellite in 2005, which used the 1300 bus.
​
To address the rising demand for smaller satellites and multiple-satellite low Earth orbit (“LEO”) and medium Earth orbit (“MEO”) constellations used for imaging, sensing and communication applications, we are developing our Legion-class bus, which will first be used for the next-generation WorldView Legion (“WV-Legion”) constellation for our Earth Intelligence business. We believe the Legion bus will be effective for government and commercial applications that require a multiple-satellite constellation of identical satellites produced in a cost-efficient manner.
​
Other satellite manufacturers have developed or are developing digital payloads which increase flexibility for geostationary satellites in circumstances where demand is not predictable. In circumstances when our customers have expressed interest in this technology, we have teamed with providers of this technology to enhance our offering. Space Infrastructure also builds advanced robotic and servicing systems for military and infrastructure applications. Our robotics technologies have been used on the Mars landers and rovers. We work with NASA on projects such as Restore-L, a robotic spacecraft equipped with the technologies, tools, and techniques needed to extend satellites’ lifespans, which include refueling and relocating an existing U.S. government satellite. As noted above, our robotic technologies also include developing all five robotic arms on the surface of Mars. Additionally, we are currently developing in-orbit assembly robotic technologies via the Space Infrastructure Dexterous Robot (“SPIDER”) (formerly Dragonfly) program with NASA. To achieve further cost-effective scalability across a spectrum of mission applications, we are further developing our Legion-class modular architecture. We believe this architecture provides cost-effective customization using standard subsystems. 
​
During 2019, the Space Infrastructure segment was selected by NASA for the Power Propulsion Element of the Lunar Gateway program, utilizing the 1300-class bus. In January 2020, we announced that we were selected by NASA to build and fly SPIDER. We also announced plans to work with the West Virginia Robotic Technology Center in its proposal to perform independent verification of operations and deploy SPIDER, an autonomous robotic in-space assembly system. We will fly the first SPIDER system on NASA’s Restore-L spacecraft which will demonstrate technologies for refueling a satellite in LEO and assembling a large Ka/V band antenna. We are currently building the spacecraft bus for Restore-L, which is based on the 1300-class platform, as well as the two robotic arms that perform the refueling part of the mission. Additionally, we began production on a Legion class geostationary communications satellite with a digital processor for Ovzon, a company that provides mobile broadband connectivity in underserved regions. We were also selected by NASA to integrate and fly their Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring of Pollution (“TEMPO”) instrument on a commercial GEO satellite. In the fourth quarter, we delivered the robotic Sample Handling Assembly for NASA’s Mars 2020 rover. Lastly, we successfully launched PSN VI with two co-passenger payloads, EUTELSAT 7 and Intelsat 39 during the year.
​
Our principal customers in the Space Infrastructure segment are commercial satellite operators and government agencies worldwide.

Our primary competitors for satellite manufacturing contracts are: The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, and Northrop Grumman Corporation in the United States; Thales S.A. and Airbus Defence and Space, a subsidiary of the Airbus Group, in Europe; and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in Japan. We sell in a highly competitive market. In addition, many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. We may also face competition in the future from emerging low-cost competitors in India, Russia and China.

​
During 2019, the MDA segment signed a contract with Lockheed Martin for the Canadian Surface Combatant program to provide the electronic warfare suite. During the second quarter, we successfully launched the RADARSAT constellation mission (“RCM”) satellites. During the third quarter, we were awarded two contracts from the Canadian Space Agency for work on Phase A of the robotic interfaces for Canadarm3 on the NASA-led Gateway. Additionally, we were selected to design and manufacture advanced space-based L-band navigation antennas as part of a hosted payload on the MEASAT-3d satellite, which is currently being built by Airbus. These navigation antennas will be integrated on a hosted payload for South Korean KTSAT that will support the Korea Augmentation Satellite System (“KASS”). 
​
Our principal customers in the MDA segment are the Canadian government and other government and commercial customers worldwide. The competitors in the MDA segment are similar to those in our Earth Intelligence and Space Infrastructure segments.
​
Industry Overview
​
Large and Growing Addressable Market
​
We believe that there is potential for growth among three key components of our addressable market: the U.S. government, other governments, and commercial customers. For both the U.S. and other governments, drivers of growth include persistent global security threats, resilient defense budgets, continued demand for high-quality imagery and value-added services and a focus on space as an investment. We believe that the U.S. government is interested in expanding the use of commercial alternatives to owned assets and that other governments present an opportunity for growth. We seek to align our products and services with the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”)’s National Defense Strategy needs, as well as growing international defense and intelligence demand. For civil customers, in particular NASA, growth is being driven by rising budgets to support space exploration programs such as Artemis and Earth science projects. For commercial customers, drivers of growth include strong demand for imagery due to new uses cases 

9



enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning, space-based remote sensing, GEO replacement demand, and LEO communications programs.
​
Diverse Solutions for Diverse End-Markets
​
While traditionally spending in space has been dominated by military defense programs and the communications industry, the proliferation of technology and cheaper access to space has led to a diversification in end-market users. Machine learning, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and “big data” have given rise to multiple use cases across industries, such as oil & gas, agriculture, transportation, insurance, finance and non-governmental organizations. Concurrently, geopolitical competition in space as a contested domain is leading to further investment by global militaries. We have evolved with this changing environment to serve a multitude of customers. 
​
Markets in Which We Operate
​
Our Earth Intelligence, Space Infrastructure, and MDA Segments operate in both the Earth Observation and Satellite Manufacturing markets. 
​
Earth Observation Market
​
The Earth Observation, or EO, market includes the collection and processing of optical and non-optical imagery data of the Earth from space. Specifically, the market is segmented into Data, Value-Added Services (“VAS”), Information Products and Big Data Analytics. The Data segment consists of raw imagery transmitted from the satellite to the ground station and products, such as stereo imaging and basic corrections (radiometric and geometric). VAS includes processing applications that transform raw data into information. Information Products integrates other datasets into the imagery through layering or data fusion (such as traffic information and street names). Finally, Big Data Analytics includes several of the attributes of Information Products and extracts statistical information not apparent in the base data by analyzing a given area over a period while monitoring changes in environments.
​
The EO market serves customers in a variety of sectors, including defense & intelligence, energy & natural resources, industrials, managed living resources (such as agriculture and forestry), public authorities, services (such as finance, insurance, news and media), and weather. Providers generally compete on resolution, revisit frequency, delivery (cloud versus traditional) and pricing.
​
Northern Sky Research forecasts the EO market is entering a period of strong growth, largely driven by increased demand for Information Products and Big Data Analytics with continued strength in the North American market and government & military end-markets. Northern Sky Research projects that the EO market will grow from $3.3 billion in total revenue in 2018 to $7.2 billion in total revenue in 2028, an expected 8% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”).
Additionally, with the advancement of AI solutions to power EO data analysis, Euroconsult believes there is potential for the VAS portion of the EO market to grow to $12.1 billion by 2026. It is increasingly likely that value in the EO market will be driven by AI-enabled data analytics.
Satellite Manufacturing Market
The satellite industry has undergone a significant change with the proliferation of LEO satellites. LEO satellites are cheaper to launch, have higher revisit rates and have less latency in their communications, but are also unable to carry heavier and more capable sensor suites. Also, as space becomes increasingly contested, a shift is expected towards LEO constellations to enhance survivability of the constellation network. On the other hand, GEO satellites cover more area from a higher vantage point and carry more advanced sensor or communication suites. Due to their greater distance from earth, however, there is increased latency. MEO satellites attempt to blend the benefits of both LEO and GEO satellites. In addition to altitude class, satellites are classified by functions, such as communications or earth observation.
According to Euroconsult, satellite manufacturing for vehicles over 50kg is expected to experience a three-fold increase in the number of satellites over the period of 2017 - 2026 compared to the previous decade. This represents a market of $304.0 billion for manufacturing and launch services. While most launches will be LEO, Euroconsult anticipates 350 

10



GEO satellites, including 140 commercial satellites, will be manufactured and launched over the same period. This represents a market of $103.0 billion for manufacturing and launch services over the period of 2018-2027. 
​
LEO proliferation is expected to greatly increase access to space, thus enabling new commercial customers across diversified industries including oil & gas, insurance, agriculture, and asset management firms, as well as nonprofit organizations, to benefit from satellite imagery.
​
Government Investment in Space Programs 
​
With more than half of our revenues coming from U.S. government customers, we expect that our Space Infrastructure and Earth Intelligence segments will benefit from growing defense and Space Infrastructure budgets. The proliferation of space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and communications is expected to drive increased government investments in the sector through the mid-2020’s.
​
Global
Euroconsult projects that world governments are in the early stages of a 10-year growth cycle for space programs, with spending increasing from $70.9 billion in 2018 to $84.6 billion in 2025, or an expected 3% CAGR.
United States
In the United States, there is a concerted effort by the government to accelerate space investment. According to the Congressional Research Service, the President’s Fiscal Year 2020 budget request of $14.1 billion for the National Security Space (“NSS”) budget represents a 14% increase in funding over the Fiscal Year 2019 enacted figure of $12.3 billion. The NSS, the newest of 12 Major Force Programs in the DoD, was created in 2016. Additionally, the DoD has been undergoing a space enterprise reorganization. On December 20, 2019, with the enactment of the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, the U.S. Space Force (“USSF”) was established. The mission of the USSF is to organize, train, and equip space forces in order to protect the U.S. and allied interests in space and to provide space capabilities to the joint force.
The NSS budget generally excludes funding for the NRO and NGA. Specific funding levels for these organizations, which are long-term historical customers, are generally classified. However, per the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the aggregate funding requests for the National Intelligence Program (“NIP”) were $57.7 billion in 2017, $59.9 billion in 2018 and $62.8 billion in 2019. The NRO and NGA are included in the NIP.
Furthermore, the President’s Fiscal Year 2020 NASA budget further highlights an effort by the government to invest in space exploration and development. The budget provides $21 billion, including $10.7 billion to continue building the key components of the Exploration campaign that will send astronauts to the Moon and beyond, including the Lunar Gateway.
​
Growth Strategy
Our vision is to hold market leading positions in each of the markets we serve. We aim to achieve this by applying innovative technologies and capabilities that provide value to our customers across their entire value chain, including components, subsystems, systems, data and services. Specific elements of our strategy across our two segments include:
Earth Intelligence
Driving revenue growth through improvements in our products—we seek to improve our Earth intelligence products with WV-Legion by productizing technologies and derivative content developed in support of individual customer contracts, such as using more artificial intelligence and machine learning to extract features, detect objects, and detect change in our satellite imagery and complementary content. WV-Legion will be a fleet of six high performing satellites for which our Space Infrastructure segment is acting as prime contractor. With a planned launch in 2021, we expect that WV-Legion, in addition to our current constellation, will revisit rapidly changing areas more than 15 times per day, an 

11



increase from four times per day currently, which more than triples both our capacity to collect 30 cm imagery and our overall capacity in high-demand areas. The revisit rate and increase in capacity enables a clearer understanding of on-ground conditions, allowing for more real-time, actionable analysis to deliver insights on rapidly changing environments and populations, while providing for more frequent monitoring for defense and intelligence applications, enhanced emergency responsiveness and maritime surveillance, among other applications. WV-Legion is planned to be compatible with our global infrastructure and access programs. We believe we provide imagery with five times the information content (tied to resolution) of our nearest competitor and over ten times the information content and better than two times the accuracy of the nearest smallsat competitor. We believe we will be able to provide even greater quality imagery and with higher revisit rates upon deployment of our WV-Legion constellation. We have developed technology used to enhance the quality and usability of imagery (e.g. eliminate atmospheric distortions, increase positional accuracy, improved interpretability, etc.), create information derivatives (e.g. road vectors, material types, land classification, etc.), fuse multiple types of content (internet of things, optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar imagery, vectors, social media, etc.), detect change, determine meaningful correlations between events and information in content analyzed, determine and model patterns of life, and other geospatial processing technologies.  We believe that creating standard products using this technology will grow our product-based revenue with customers in the technology, defense and intelligence, civil government, and global development organization sectors.
​
Expanding our relationship with the U.S. government—the U.S. government is the largest customer of our Earth Intelligence segment through the EnhancedView Follow-On (the “EnhancedView Contract”) and Global-EGD programs, and various classified and unclassified contract vehicles. Demand for geospatial intelligence and services continues to grow given the geopolitical environment and the confluence of high-performance computing and machine learning algorithms that allow for insight to be extracted from ever greater levels of data being produced by EO sensors and national and commercial satellite assets. The U.S. government has expressed interest in increasingly relying on commercial partners to provide geospatial data given cost affordability and advances in technology that provide high quality imagery. We seek to grow our business with the U.S. government by leveraging the investments we have made across our capability set, including in machine learning and AI, and our strong record of historic performance.
​
Growing our installed base and penetration of international defense and intelligence customers—we currently provide service to U.S.-allied nations through our SecureWatch, Rapid Access, and Direct Access products. These customers use our imagery in their civil and intelligence related missions. Our imagery and services are either complimentary to national assets owned by these countries, or in some cases defer the need for a country to own and operate national assets. We believe there are many prospective customers that have both the mission need and budget for our services which we seek to add to our installed base. We also seek to further penetrate existing customers through the provision of additional data and services. Lastly, we believe there are opportunities to provide our services to U.S.-allied nations who might seek a compliment to national capabilities in geospatial analytics. Our strategy focuses on those countries that currently have deep and long-standing relationships with our Earth Intelligence segment and other close U.S. allies.
​
Growing with and expanding our installed base among commercial customers—we have over 400 commercial customers that use our data in their products and applications across a variety of industries including technology, telecom, transportation, mining, and oil and gas. The confluence of high-performance computing and machine learning algorithms are allowing for insights to be extracted from ever greater levels of data, which in turn is driving innovation across our customer base. We expect this trend to continue, and we seek to grow with our existing customers as well as to grow our installed base by leveraging our market leading imagery capabilities. Furthermore, we believe our capabilities in machine learning, AI, and products that allow greater insights to be more easily extracted from large amounts of geospatial data will position us to sell additional solutions to our commercial customers.
​
Providing products based on machine learning and artificial intelligence—we are developing our capabilities in machine learning and AI to extract greater insight from the geospatial data available to us and our customers. We are also working on the productization of our capability set across geospatial analytics and services to facilitate the penetration of international government and commercial markets.

Delivering 3D products to global defense, intelligence and commercial customers – through Vricon, Inc., our joint venture with Saab AB, we are expanding the market demand for global scale 3D products. 3D products allow decision 

12



makers to understand their operational environment in 3D – developing new insights that enable them to make better, faster decisions. We see a growing opportunity to sell 3D data and software products to the military and intelligence community to support virtual training environments and provide better information to the warfighter. U.S. Defense and Intelligence is seeking solutions to support intelligence fusion, maneuver, and other mission requirements. We also see tremendous opportunity with our commercial customers as they look for more accurate geodata to improve their products. The current investment in 5G networks and Internet of Things provides a unique opportunity to deliver network operators a better data solution to improve their future networks. Additional use cases continue to grow as 3D products and precision data sets become better understood.
​
Space Infrastructure
Driving revenue through improvement in our products—we are developing differentiated capabilities that are designed for future space exploration, including propulsion, power, and robotics. We believe these elements will be critical to helping our customers operate in an increasingly contested space environment and in achieving successful space exploration missions. We are also developing our satellite architectures and manufacturing capabilities to assure that we can successfully fulfill both government and commercial customer requirements on future programs. We are also developing relationships across the supply chain to assure that we can seamlessly provide a broad-breadth of mission sets to our customers.
​
Growing our U.S. and international civil exposure—we have a long history with civil space programs dating back to the Apollo missions. Current NASA programs include the Power Propulsion Element for the Lunar Gateway, Restore-L, Psyche TEMPO and SPIDER. We have also provided every robotic arm on NASA’s Mars rovers. We seek to leverage our investments and expertise in propulsion, power, and robotics, as well as our strong legacy of performance, when pursuing further civil work in the U.S. and abroad.
​
Deepening our penetration of U.S. national programs—to date, we have won several classified and unclassified study contracts with U.S. defense and intelligence customers. We seek to further penetrate these markets by utilizing our flexible satellite architectures, design and engineering capabilities, and commercial business practices—all of which we believe can create compelling value propositions.
​
Providing flexible platforms to our commercial customers—we currently provide components, sub-systems, and system architectures to our customers for communications and EO satellites in LEO, MEO and GEO orbits. In communications, we offer flexible platforms across various architecture platforms and mission payloads from standard analog to high through-put. In EO, we also offer flexible solutions across various architecture platforms and mission payloads, including electro-optic. Our goal is to be positioned well to compete for future single satellite or full constellation build orders from our customers, across a wide range of the architectures, payloads, or Earth orbit chosen to fulfill mission requirements.
​
Environmental Regulations
​
Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the soil, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have infrastructure in place to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. We do not believe that the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results or competitive position. The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations or a determination that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances at our sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters. We have been designated, along with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the clean-up of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. There can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future, or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites at which no problem is currently known.

U.S. Government Contracts
All of our reportable segments have contracts with various governmental entities, which are concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. The U.S. government may terminate or suspend our contracts, including the EnhancedView Contract with the U.S. government in our Earth Intelligence segment, at any time with or without cause. Additionally, any changes in the size, scope or term of the EnhancedView Contract could impact our satellite replenishment strategy and our ability to repay or refinance our long-term debt. Although our U.S. government contracts generally involve fixed annual minimum commitments, such commitments, along with all other contracts with the U.S. government, are subject to annual Congressional appropriations and the federal budget process, and as a result, the U.S. government may not continue to fund these contracts at current or anticipated levels.
​
Intellectual Property
​
We own a substantial intellectual property portfolio that includes many U.S. and foreign patents, as well as many U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. We actively pursue internal development of intellectual property. In addition to our patent portfolio, we own other intellectual property such as unpatented trade secrets, know-how, data, and software. Additionally, we rely on licenses of certain intellectual property to conduct our business operations, including certain proprietary rights to and from third parties. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our operations, we do not believe that any particular trade secret, patent, trademark, copyright, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss, expiration or termination would have a material effect on our business.
​
Foreign and Domestic Operations
​
In the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 25% of our revenue was derived from non-U.S. sales, and we intend to continue to pursue international contracts. International operations are subject to certain risks, such as: changes in domestic and foreign governmental regulations and licensing requirements; deterioration of relations between the U.S. and a particular foreign country; increases in tariffs and taxes and other trade barriers; foreign currency fluctuations; changes in political and economic stability; effects of austerity programs or similar significant budget reduction programs; potential preferences by prospective customers to purchase from local (non-U.S.) sources; and difficulties in obtaining or enforcing judgments in foreign jurisdictions.

In addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties in the event we fail to meet such requirements. 
​
Raw Materials
​
Our businesses are generally engaged in limited manufacturing activities and have minimal exposure to fluctuations in the supply of raw materials. For those businesses that manufacture and sell products and systems, most of the value that we provide is labor oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities. In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities as well as a diverse base of third-party suppliers and subcontractors. Certain aspects of our manufacturing activities require relatively scarce raw materials; occasionally, we have experienced difficulty in our ability to procure raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes.
​
Research and Development
​
We have a history of investing in development of technological advancements in our field of aerospace. We have both internally and externally funded research and development projects. Our current and future business is dependent on developing new enhancements and technology that go into our existing and future products and services. Our annual research and development expenses from continuing operations were $10 million, $88 million, and $62 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We intend to continue our focus on research and development and product and service enhancements as a key strategy for innovation and growth. One of our current 

14



areas of focus is our development of the WV-Legion program, a capital project, and other new offerings within our Earth Intelligence segment, including 3D technology through our Vricon joint venture. Our efforts will continue to be directed into fields that we believe offer the greatest opportunities for long-term growth and profitability.
