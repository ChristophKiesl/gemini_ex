ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

General
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on March 29, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial Business Combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, activities related to our initial public offering and, after our initial public offering, the search for a Business Combination target. We have generated no operating revenues to date, and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial Business Combination.
 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to focus on large addressable markets undergoing profound structural and generational change, accelerated by a need for greater equity among all stakeholders.
 
In the last decade, we have seen a global shift to the digital economy as technology has enabled unlimited consumer choice, boundless scale, and uncapped opportunities. The full emergence of the internet economy has effectively unlocked a previously tethered system, where monetization possibilities are no longer constrained by legacy business models. From this new unlocked system, there is an increasingly empowered and emboldened consumer. The historical barriers separating the individual from the company or the brand are no more, and companies that recognize, maximize and perpetuate the permanence of this direct-to-consumer dynamic will be the next generation of winners.
 
We intend to seek visionary founders leading technology-enabled platforms disrupting the traditional worlds of sports, health, wellness, food, commerce, and culture through their unique relationship with the consumer. We intend to pursue acquisitions of platforms that are creating communities around their brands, listening to what their consumers want and fulfilling those wants in innovative and unprecedented ways. We believe the unique reach, influence access, prominence and investing track record of Mr. Durant and Mr. Kleiman combined with the extensive scope of LionTree’s relationships, strategic network and proprietary deal flow makes us a highly unique and differentiated partner to potential target businesses and will enhance our ability to effectuate an attractive Business Combination.
 
OUR SPONSORS
 
Our sponsor is controlled by NBA superstar Kevin Durant and entrepreneur Rich Kleiman, and LionTree, a leading investment and merchant bank. The history of the working relationship between Mr. Durant, Mr. Kleiman and principals at LionTree goes back for several years. We believe the combined capabilities of both Mr. Durant, Mr. Kleiman and their respective affiliates, including Thirty Five Ventures, and LionTree (the “sponsor group”), highlighted by our core sector overlap and highly complementary unique attributes, create a differentiated sponsor group that we believe will provide competitive advantages in sourcing, effecting an attractive combination and driving long-term value for our shareholders.
THIRTY FIVE VENTURES
 
Thirty Five Ventures was founded in 2016 by Mr. Durant and Mr. Kleiman on the shared belief that the access, global reach and influence of an NBA superstar of Mr. Durant’s caliber would create unique investment and business opportunities well beyond traditional athlete endorsements. During Mr. Durant’s years with the Golden State Warriors from 2016-2019, he and Mr. Kleiman immersed themselves in the Silicon Valley ecosystem, building deep relationships that have since led to their invitation into some of the most high profile venture deals, including notable companies and entities such as Postmates, Acorns, Whoop, Overtime, Caffeine, Robinhood, and Coinbase. In addition to venture stage opportunities, Thirty Five Ventures also invested in MLS’s Philadelphia Union and has pursued real estate investments, including a commercial building in Suitland, MD. Mr. Durant and Mr. Kleiman are also focusing their efforts on building an infrastructure at Thirty Five Ventures from which they could launch their own businesses, including: Boardroom, a sports business media platform featuring digital video series, podcasts, e-newsletter, feature news articles, and digital and social media content covering the athletes, executives, and companies behind the biggest sports business stories; and a media production business which has produced scripted and unscripted film television, digital and branded content projects including 2020’s In the Water documentary on Showtime, 2021’s Swagger - a  scripted series for AppleTV in partnership with Imagine Entertainment and CBS Studios - and Two Distant Strangers, a 2021 Academy Award winning film. The mission across all of Thirty Five Ventures business initiatives is to leverage the access and business savvy of Mr. Durant and Mr. Kleiman to find great investments, forge unique partnerships, and produce creative works at the intersection of sports, media and culture. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Past performance by our management team or their respective affiliates, including LionTree and Thirty Five Ventures, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.”
 


 
LIONTREE
 
LionTree brings highly trusted advisory and investment experience to Infinite Acquisition Corp. Founded in 2012, the firm is headquartered in New York with offices in San Francisco, Paris and London. LionTree leverages its unique insights and relationships across its integrated product set: M&A Advisory, Capital Raising, LT Growth, IPO Advisory, Institutional Investor Membership and Merchant Banking.

LionTree’s Merchant Banking business co-invests with clients across venture, growth, and private equity.

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Past performance by our management team or their respective affiliates, including LionTree and Thirty Five Ventures, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.”
 
SOURCING, CAPITAL RAISING AND TRANSACTION EXPERTISE
 
We intend to leverage our sponsor group’s unique and extensive global networks to access direct and proprietary opportunities that are disrupting the traditional worlds of sports, health, wellness, food, commerce, and culture through their unique relationship with the consumer. We believe our process of screening and selecting potential target companies for our initial Business Combination will be highly differentiated.
 
Our advantage is driven by our sponsor group’s proven track records of successfully sourcing attractive investment opportunities through a proprietary network of relationships with a wide range of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, management teams and former executives of public and private companies, private equity sponsors and investment bankers.
 
Our sponsor group developed its networks through years of experience advising, investing in, operating and selling businesses across the technology, media, sports and entertainment sectors and consequently have established reputations as ethical business principals and operators and long-term, patient partners.
 
LionTree’s strategic advisory business also includes a capital raising platform led by a team that has raised privately placed capital on behalf of clients for longer than a decade from a wide network of institutional investors. We believe this unique network of relationships will significantly enhance our ability to raise additional capital either in conjunction with our initial Business Combination or at some point in the future.
 


 
We have extensive experience guiding management teams of companies we have invested in as they develop and execute growth strategies that include transitioning to digital business models, rolling out new products and services, expanding globally, growing via partnership or acquisitions, and leveraging brands and IP across an increasingly diverse and complex landscape. We also plan to leverage our sponsor’s and our board of directors (members’ extensive transaction experience across both public and private markets to effectively close a transaction in a timely manner. We believe the public company experience that resides in our sponsor group and our board of directors will be valuable in the process of negotiating and closing our initial Business Combination.
