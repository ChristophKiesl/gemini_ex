Item 1. Business 
Overview
 
We are engaged in the development, production and marketing of innovative miniaturized imaging equipment known as our micro ScoutCam™ technology for use in medical procedures as well as various applications in other industries. Our current business model is that of a B2B approach, in which we seek to identify target businesses interested in integrating our micro ScoutCam™ technology, or commissioning individual projects using our technology. As of the date of this prospectus, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from applications of our micro ScoutCam™ technology within the medical and industrial fields. We have recently begun examining additional applications for our micro ScoutCam™ portfolio outside of the medical device industry, including sectors such as, inter alia, the homeland security and defense, aerospace (including commercial drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and manned airplanes), automotive, industrial non-destructing-testing industries, and predictive maintenance (i.e. Industry 4.0) based on Internet of Things (IoT). We plan to further expand the activity in these non-medical spaces.

Recent Developments 
 
On March 22, 2021, the Company undertook to issue to certain investors (the “Investors”) 22,222,223 units (the “Units”) in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million (the “Private Placement”). Each Unit consists of (i) one share of the Company’s Common Stock and (ii) one warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock with an exercise price of US$1.15 per share (the “Warrant” and the “Exercise Price”). Each Warrant is exercisable until the close of business on March 31, 2026. Pursuant to the terms of the Warrants, following April 1, 2024, if the closing price of the Common Stock equal or exceeds 135% of the Exercise Price (subject to appropriate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions after the issue date of the Warrants) for any thirty (30) consecutive trading days, the Company may force the exercise of the Warrants, in whole or in part, by delivering to the Investors a notice of forced exercise.
Our Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 22, 2013 under the name Intellisense Solutions Inc. We were initially engaged in the business of developing web portals to allow companies and individuals to engage in the purchase and sale of vegetarian food products over the Internet. However, we were unable to execute our original business plan, develop significant operations or achieve commercial sales.
 
We received initial funding in March 2014 in the aggregate amount of $19,980 through the sale of Common Stock to two of our former officers and directors, who purchased in the aggregate 1,998,000 shares of our Common Stock at $0.01 per share.
 
On January 10, 2019, we formed Canna Patch Ltd., or Canna Patch, an Israeli corporation, of which 90% was initially owned by our Company, and the remaining 10% owned by Rafael Ezra, Canna Patch’s Chief Technology Officer. Canna Patch did not have any operations and on December 4, 2019, we sold 100% of our holdings in Canna Patch.
 
On September 16, 2019, Intellisense and Medigus entered into that certain Exchange Agreement (as defined herein). For additional information about the Exchange Agreement, refer to “—Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” below.
 
On December 30, 2019, we acquired ScoutCam Ltd. As a result of our acquisition of ScoutCam Ltd., we now own all of ScoutCam Ltd.’s issued and outstanding share capital. We plan to integrate and fully adopt ScoutCam Ltd.’s business into our Company as our primary business activity.
 
ScoutCam Ltd. was formed in the State of Israel on January 3, 2019 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medigus, an Israeli company traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and commenced operations on March 1, 2019. ScoutCam Ltd. was incorporated as part of a reorganization of Medigus, which was designed to distinguish ScoutCam Ltd.’s miniaturized imaging business, or the micro ScoutCam™ portfolio, from Medigus’ other operations and to enable Medigus to form a separate business unit with dedicated resources focused on the promotion of such technology. On December 1, 2019, Medigus and ScoutCam Ltd. consummated a certain Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement, which transferred and assigned certain assets and intellectual property rights related to its miniaturized imaging business. For additional information about the Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement, refer to “—Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” below. On May 18, 2020, in connection with the Arkin Transaction (as defined below), the Company and Medigus entered into a certain Side Letter Agreement (the “Letter Agreement”), whereby the parties agreed to amend certain terms of the Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement and the License Agreement. For additional information about the Letter Agreement, refer to “—Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” below.


On April 20, 2020, ScoutCam Ltd. entered into an Amended and Restated Intercompany Services Agreement with Medigus (the “Intercompany Services Agreement”), which effectively amended and restated an intercompany services agreement dated May 30, 2019. For additional information about the Intercompany Services Agreement, refer to “—Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” below.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our vision is to improve the performance of organizations by offering prestigious tools that enhance the visual technological capabilities of companies across a variety of industries. Our mission is to become a global leader providing innovative, custom-tailored visualization solutions to organizations across a variety of industries based on small and highly resistant cameras and supplementary technologies. Since we are focused on custom-tailored solutions, we have a very limited offering of off-the-shelf products, which are used mainly as demonstrators for new prospects of our technology and capabilities, rather than as a major source of revenue. Moreover, as we focus only on the visualization apparatus and supporting components, including for example a small camera (that consists of a miniature CMOS video sensor, optics, filters, electronics, housing and cables), illumination, cleaning methods (e.g., irrigation), and/or a mechanical structure based on the customer’s needs, in most cases our products are components of the customer’s end-user products rather than independent end-user products.

Certain illustrative examples of our component parts that have been previously integrated into our clients’ end-user products include:
 

The Company’s micro ScoutCam™ 6.5 Lum, pictured above, was integrated into a NASA-commissioned project, and as a result it became the first micro camera utilized in orbit, and thereafter was successfully operated outside the International Space Station in May 2015 (see: nexis.gsfc.nasa.gov/rrm_phase2vipir.html and youtu.be/O9bmZJATnJs).
 

Pictured above is a single-use visualization solution that was developed and sold to A.M. Surgical, which was designed to replace expensive and bulky reusable endoscopes used in carpal tunnel surgery by their Stratos surgical device. We prepared both wired and wireless versions. Wireless device was cleared for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and it is compliant with FCC regulations.
 
Our business model includes engaging companies seeking to add a video visualization to their existing or new product(s) or looking into developing new products that include micro video visualization. Accordingly, our customer base is exclusively comprised of businesses, and therefore we are entirely removed from marketing, manufacturing, selling and distributing end-user products to consumers. Our engagement with businesses is ordinarily conducted in two phases. During the first phase, we conduct the research and development that is required in order to specify, design, develop, and product the designated visualization apparatus, all for an agreed compensation (e.g., a non-recurrent engineering fee). During the second phase, we manufacture the apparatus and sell it to the customer for an agreed transfer price. In some cases, upon a customer’s request, we offer complete ‘turn-key’ contracts, in which we are responsible for most or all product phases, from the specifications phase to the provision of components or products that are complete, packaged and ready for sale. In such cases, we may conduct the necessary regulatory tests and handle the required regulatory approvals. In addition, we may also be responsible, as necessary, for, inter alia, packaging, sterilization, labeling and shipment.
 
Our customers include technology-based companies and organizations of all sizes, from early stage start-ups to large, well-established, international corporations. However, we prefer engaging the latter business partnership as larger corporations provide financial stability, large purchased quantities, recurring revenue, and valid forecasts for extended durations. In addition, we engage customers from various industries, such as biomedical, aerospace, certain sensitive or classified industries, security and defense, and research.
 
In order to locate and secure new customers we employ both active and passive marketing strategies. As part of our active approach, we employ three business development managers who analyze target industries and assess whether micro visualization components may add value to companies operating in those industries. Once we have identified a potentially relevant industry, we approach a variety of target companies and market the benefits of integrating our micro visualization components into their products. As of the current date, we are in the process of expanding our business development team in order to better and more effectively implement the foregoing marketing strategy. In addition, in order to assist us in identifying such industries and target companies, we consult with subject matter experts from various industries.

In addition to the active marketing strategy described above, we also employ a multitude of available marketing channels in order to increase the exposure of our services to relevant industries. These marketing channels include advertising, participating in relevant tradeshows and conferences, web-marketing, which includes a well maintained website, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), social media presence, frequent distributions of press-releases in target countries, as well as conventional marketing means, including brochures, presentations, etc. Additionally, we issue industry-specific marketing materials that are tailored to highlight the relevant features of our technology to a specific target industry.
 
As described above, we interact with prospects globally in order to engage in and secure new projects by various business development and marketing means, specifically by way of active and passive marketing measures in order to gather interest from potential customers. These efforts may include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

● | engaging third party companies as territorial representatives in key markets; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | initiating business engagements based on leads received through our website or via other methods or means; 
● | conducting initial R&D together with such prospects in order to evaluate the feasibility of their contemplated projects; 
● | maintaining an updated and detailed website presenting our core competency and proven track record; 
● | promoting our website in different search engines and other digital forums through SEO campaigning as well as other proactive digital marketing measures; 
● | employing certain social media platforms for campaigning and advertising; 
● | reconnecting with our large database, which includes a multitude of past prospects; 
● | developing and refining marketing communications materials, including digital and printed brochures; and 
● | participating in major vision technology exhibitions such as AIA Vision Show (USA) and Vision Show (Germany). 

 
In addition to our business development efforts that are mainly based on currently existing or future customer needs, we aim to identify new market opportunities. These efforts include systematical analysis of industrial fields as well as medical fields and procedures in order to identify where miniature visualization solutions might benefit and attract value. To this end, we have contracted business development executives with expertise in these fields that are using various resources and interviewing potential uses in identifying the most promising opportunities. When a potential opportunity is identified we protect our rights by establishing the relevant intellectual property safeguards, develop various prototypes that may be relevant for the specific application and engage the key opinion leaders of that field to validate the feasibility of our solutions. Given that we are not a B2C company, our business model does not include commercialization of end-user products; nevertheless, we intend to engage relevant companies to partner with us in order to convert our innovative prototypes into market-ready products, completing the required regulatory clearances, and commercializing them based on revenue share models.

We have certain internal procedures in place for when a potential customer is identified, which when triggered helps provide a roadmap for the ensuing working relationship with that potential customer. Prior to any formal engagement with a potential customer, two of our departments – business development and R&D – work in parallel and in accordance with their own internal procedures. The goal of this work is to define an understanding with the customer that will ordinarily incorporate two phases: (a) an R&D phase, during which the R&D team develops a custom-tailored visualization component that synthesizes our technology and skill with the customer’s stated requirements, specifications, and business constraints, and which phase generally includes a formal agreement with respect to the Non-Recurrent Engineering (NRE) fee that is typically payable according to a pre-defined set of milestones; and (b) a production phase, during which we manufacture and supply the component part for an agreed upon transfer price.
 
Over the years, we have implemented a pricing scheme that allows us to separately price services rendered during the previously described first phase. Pricing of this first phase is typically prepared by the engineering team, which provides an assessment of the anticipated costs associated with the R&D of the project, which price will depend on a given customer’s specifications and project vision. Such costs may include, inter alia, engineering labor, any contracts with sub-contractors, tooling, off-the-shelf and newly designed components, materials, prototypes production, testing, management overhead, and travel costs. Once we have completed our cost estimation for the R&D phase, we issue our quote with a certain margin to the customer.
 
In order to price the transfer price that will be issued in connection with the aforementioned second phase, the expected Bill-Of Material (BOM) and Cost-Of-Good Sold (COGS) are established and we price it accordingly with a certain margin to the customer. Often times there are certain modifications to the original project outlined and agreed upon in the R&D phase, which might necessitate an increase or decrease to the pricing of the overall project. For that reason, we tend to include a certain margin of flexibility in the final target transfer price. In addition, we usually link the end transfer price with both annual and per-order Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ), in order to reflect the actual production quantity of the COGS as well as to commercially incentivize the customer to order larger quantities.
 
Both the negotiation process and the contract drafting are usually done in collaboration with the customer, such that both sides can verify throughout the process that the final agreement meets their technological and business expectations. Furthermore, we are keen to maintain close contact with the customer throughout the two phases of our engagement with the customer, including for example, by way of teleconferences, virtual and actual meetings, document exchanges, on-site visits, and reporting of any completion of predefined milestones.
 
Our Customers 
 
Currently, we have three major customers that generate most of our current and forecasted revenue in the near term: (1) a large international bio-med company that is developing a visualization component for its invasive surgical device, (see ‘Customer B’ in note 11 to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020) (2) a medical device company that specializes in orthopedic surgeries and develops and markets minimally invasive surgical devices, (see ‘Customer A’ in note 11 to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020), and (3) a commercial vehicle manufacturer in the aerospace sphere that is engineering a prototype for remote diagnostics of jet engines, (see ‘Customer C’ in note 11 to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020).


In addition to these three material customers, we are engaged in initial negotiations with multiple potential customers operating in a variety of sectors, including biomedical, aerospace, industry, military and security, and others. We currently consider the biomedical and aerospace industries to be our core target industries, and from which we receive the greatest level of interest and demand. We are pursuing these potential engagements with the goal of securing research and development contracts that may then materialize into multi-year production contracts. We are in various stages of engagement with a variety of customers in all the above mentioned industries.
 
In the biomedical space, for example, we generally seek to partner with medical device and pharmaceutical companies that develop endoscopes with or without additional functionality. This variation allows the endoscope to be introduced into anatomical parts that were previously irrelevant within the video-endoscope space either because of the outer diameter and/or price. To this end, we focus on single-use products that accommodate the global trend to transition from expensive, multi-use products that require thorough a cleaning protocol, but which cannot be sterilized, to single-use products.

In the defense and military space, we have partnered with the research and development apparatus of the Israel Defense Forces, specifically to assist in the development of a small and lightweight “basket of cameras” that can be mounted on either a military-grade helmet or a balloon-type device, which would enable the viewer to 360 degrees of vision from the mounted vantage point, in addition to automatic threat detection.
 
Lastly, we have recently mobilized efforts to market the possibility of employing the micro ScoutCam™ technology for the purposes of monitoring bearings and other sensitive mechanical structures in the IAF helicopters and UAVs. Such an application would complement the rising global market trends associated with Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT), in which machines are programmed to test themselves and their production output, which then automatically alerts the processor of any potential problems at the outset of the endeavor.
 
Competition
 
We previously operated without competition from other companies; however, today there are several companies that offer small cameras, including, but not limited to, Opcom, Fujikura-Picoramedic, Awaiba, Fisba and Misumi. We, unlike the aforementioned competitors, offer customized solutions, which includes additional components as needed. Other companies, such as IntraVu, Medit, and SPI Engineering, offer complete small diameter off-the shelf endoscopes/borescopes. We, however, focus instead on customizing and integrating our solutions into a given customer’s device. Certain companies, such as Enable, Myriad Fiber Imaging Tech., Inc., and Precision Optics, act as direct competitors, since they offer similar services.
Proprietary Rights and Technology
 
As we develop customized components and/or products per specific customer requirements, our various projects are constantly in different stages of development, including: planning, early R&D for a proof of concept, R&D for a prototype, final product/component development, engineering necessary for a production-ready version, and production of initial batches.
 
Our intellectual property rights include such patents and patent licenses that were granted or transferred by Medigus as part of the Addendum No. 1 to Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement (the “Addendum”), the License Agreement and the Letter Agreement and additional patent assets developed by ScoutCam and assigned to us from a third party. For additional information about the License Agreement refer to “—Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” below. Under the Addendum No. 1 to Amended and Restated Asset Transfer Agreement, Medigus transferred five patent families in exchange for a license in connection with the marketing and sale of the Medigus Ultrasonic Surgical Endostapler. Under the Addendum, and subject to certain limitations as further set forth therein, Medigus transferred to us the patent families 33209, 29651, 34802, 11777 and 24994, each of which is further discussed below.
 
We currently have rights to a total of five (5) patent families, four of which we consider material to our business and operating success, and which include the following:

Employment
 
We currently have 32 full-time (or near full-time) employees. This number is expected to grow. We may recruit additional engineers to the R&D team, and recruit additional production employees to support an anticipated increase in production commitments to our customers.
Regulation
 
Our approach to regulation is generally determined based on a given project. In our engagements with customers operating in the biomedical sector, we comply with the medical device standards in that corresponding territory, such as the FDA or International Organization for Standardization (ISO), among others. Compliance with these regulations is achieved through our QA department and the support we receive from highly experienced quality assurance and regulatory affairs consultants. In addition, we are being audited annually by MEDCERT GmbH, a German Notified Body.


For instance, ISO 13485:2016 is a regulatory benchmark that we comply with while working on our medical device projects. ISO 13845:2016 is similar to ISO 9001 in terms of its quality management system (QMS) requirements, however, ISO 13485:2016 is generally considered more rigorous and comprehensive.
 
Given that we do not manufacture or distribute end-user products, and instead service businesses pursuant to a B2B model, we are subject to far fewer regulatory standards commonly associated with medical device manufacturers or distributors. We develop components for other companies that thereafter develop, manufacture and distribute our components, and therefore our involvement in the production chain demands comparatively less regulatory compliance. This notwithstanding, we are careful to communicate with the business customer in order to identify certain regulatory dimensions inherent to the project, to which we should pay additional attention. For example, when a component of ours is integrated into a business’s end-user product, such as for the purpose of touching human tissue, we develop and manufacture our parts and components while taking into account certain applicable regulatory standards. These standards might include, inter alia, relevant FDA regulations (e.g. CFR 21 part 820, the medical device reporting requirements (MDR), among others) as well as ISO regulations (e.g. ISO 14644-1, specifically in connection with cleanrooms and associated controlled environments, among other items, or ISO 10993, in connection with the biological evaluation of medical devices). Furthermore, we prioritize our team’s compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directives (RoHS) and REACH (EC 1907/2006).
 
Similarly, if a component part of ours is incorporated into an electronic device for the purpose of being used inside a human body, we ensure compliance with certain FDA requirements as well as IEC 60601 for safety and Electrostatic discharge, including the heating of parts at more than 42 degrees Celsius, as well as a variety of additional technical standards designed for the safety and essential performance of medical electrical equipment. Moreover, we perform risk management assessments in accordance with EN ISO 14971:2019 and ISO/TR 24971:2013.


In certain instances, our customers prefer that we conduct the testing of its products in internationally certified labs in order to further guarantee our component parts satisfy the applicable regulatory standards. In this scenario, we perform the required tests as a service to the customer and provide the customer with the official test results, specifically in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025:2017, which the customer can later use in order to apply for the required marketing clearance of its end-user product.
 
Properties
 
We do not own property and currently lease our principal corporate office, which is located at Suite 7A, Industrial Park, P.O. Box 3030, Omer, Israel 8496500. We believe our leased office sufficiently meets our current needs.
