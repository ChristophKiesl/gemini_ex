Research Publishing & Platforms revenue by product type includes Research Publishing and Research Platforms. The graphs below present revenue by product type for the years ended April 30, 2021, and 2020:
 


Key growth strategies for the Research Publishing & Platforms segment include evolving and developing new licensing models for our institutional customers (pay to read and publish), developing new open access journals and revenue streams (pay to publish), focusing resources on high-growth and emerging markets, and developing new digital products, services, and workflow solutions to meet the needs of researchers, authors, societies, and corporate customers.

Research Publishing

Research Publishing generates the majority of its revenue from contracts with its customers in the following revenue streams:
 
 
• | Journal Subscriptions (pay to read) and Open Access (pay to publish); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Licensing, Reprints, Backfiles, and Other.
--+-------------------------------------------

Journal Subscriptions and Open Access

As of April 30, 2021, we publish approximately 1,930 academic research journals. We sell journal subscriptions directly to thousands of Research institutions worldwide through our sales representatives, indirectly through independent subscription agents, through promotional campaigns, and through memberships in professional societies for those journals that are sponsored by societies. Journal subscriptions are primarily licensed through contracts for digital content available online through our Wiley Online Library platform. Contracts are negotiated by us directly with customers or their subscription agents. Subscription periods typically cover calendar years. Print journals are generally mailed to subscribers directly from independent printers. We do not own or manage printing facilities. Subscription revenue is generally collected in advance.

Approximately 50% of Journal Subscription revenue is derived from publishing rights owned by Wiley. Publishing alliances also play a major role in Research Publishing’s success. Approximately 50% of Journal Subscription revenue is derived from publication rights that are owned by professional societies and published by us pursuant to long-term contracts or owned jointly with professional societies. These society alliances bring mutual benefit: the societies gaining Wiley’s publishing, marketing, sales, and distribution expertise, while Wiley benefits from being affiliated with prestigious societies and their members. Societies that sponsor or own such journals generally receive a royalty and/or other financial consideration. We may procure editorial services from such societies on a prenegotiated fee basis. We also enter into agreements with outside independent editors of journals that define their editorial duties and the fees and expenses for their services. Contributors of articles to our journal portfolio transfer publication rights to us or a professional society, as applicable. We publish the journals of many prestigious societies, including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the British Journal of Surgery Society, the European Molecular Biology Organization, the American Anthropological Association, the American Geophysical Union, and the German Chemical Society.

Wiley Online Library, which is delivered through our Literatum platform, provides the user with intuitive navigation, enhanced discoverability, expanded functionality, and a range of personalization options. Access to abstracts is free and full content is accessible through licensing agreements or as individual article purchases. Large portions of the content are provided free or at nominal cost to nations in the developing world through partnerships with certain nonprofit organizations. Our online publishing platforms provide revenue growth opportunities through new applications and business models, online advertising, deeper market penetration, and individual sales and pay-per-view options.

Wiley’s performance in the 2019 release of Clarivate Analytics’ Journal Citation Reports (JCR) remains strong, maintaining its top 3 position in terms of the number of titles indexed, articles published, and citations received. Wiley has 10.5% of titles, 9.5% of articles, and 11.5% of citations.

A total of 1,272 Wiley journals were included in the reports. Wiley journals ranked #1 in 21 categories across 17 titles and achieved 305 top-10 category rankings.
  
INDEX

The annual Journal Citation Reports (JCR) are one of the most widely-used sources of citation metrics used to analyze the performance of peer-reviewed journals. The most famous of these metrics, the Impact Factor, is based on the frequency with which an average article is cited in the JCR report year. Alongside other metrics, this makes it an important tool for evaluating a journal’s impact on ongoing research.

Under the Open Access business model, accepted research articles are published subject to payment of Article Publication Charges (APCs). After payment to Wiley, all open articles are immediately free to access online. Contributors of open access articles retain many rights and typically license their work under terms that permit reuse.

Open Access offers authors choices in how to share and disseminate their work, and it serves the needs of researchers who may be required by their research funder to make articles freely accessible without embargo. APCs are typically paid by the individual author or by the author’s funder, and payments are often mediated by the author’s institution. We provide specific workflows and infrastructure to authors, funders, and institutions to support the requirements of Open Access.

We offer two Open Access publishing models. The first of these is Hybrid Open Access where, upon payment of an APC, authors publishing in the majority of our paid subscription journals are offered, after article acceptance, the opportunity to make their individual research article openly available online.

The second offering of the Open Access model is a growing portfolio of fully open access journals, also known as Gold Open Access Journals, in which all accepted articles are published subject to receipt of an APC. All Open Access articles are subject to the same rigorous peer-review process applied to our subscription-based journals. As with our subscription portfolio, a number of the Gold Open Access Journals are published under contract for, or in partnership with, prestigious societies, including the American Geophysical Union, the American Heart Association, the European Molecular Biology Organization and the British Ecological Society. The Open Access portfolio spans life, physical, medical, and social sciences and includes a choice of high impact journals and broad-scope titles that offer a responsive, author-centered service.

Comprehensive agreements (read and publish), sometimes referred to as transitional agreements, are the innovative new model that blends journal subscription and open access offerings. Essentially, for a single fee, a national or regional consortium of libraries pays for and receives full read access to our journal portfolio and the ability to publish under an open access arrangement.  Like subscriptions, comprehensive deals involve recurring revenue under multiyear contracts. Unlike subscriptions, they also allow for further upside depending on how much publishing volume we generate. Comprehensive models accelerate the transition to open access while maintaining subscription access.

In March 2020, we agreed with Jisc, the UK’s research and education not-for-profit that negotiates licenses and digital content agreements on behalf of UK universities, on a four-year comprehensive “read and publish” agreement that, for an annual fee, enables UK institutions to access our journal portfolio and researchers at UK universities the means to publish open access (OA) in all Wiley journals at no direct cost to them. As part of the new agreement, the proportion of OA articles published by UK researchers will increase from 27% to an estimated 85% in year one, with the potential to reach 100% by 2022. The agreement will also enable institutions and their users to access all of Wiley’s journals. Other comprehensive agreements include consortia in Austria, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.  We are compensated through a publish and read fee.

In January 2019, we announced a contractual arrangement in support of Open Access, a countrywide partnership agreement with Projekt DEAL, a representative of nearly 700 academic institutions in Germany. This three-year agreement provides all Projekt DEAL institutions with access to read Wiley’s academic journals back to the year 1997, and researchers at Projekt DEAL institutions can publish articles open access in Wiley’s journals. The partnership will better support institutions and researchers in advancing open science, driving discovery, and developing and disseminating knowledge. We are compensated through a fee per article published.

Licensing, Reprints, Backfiles, and Other
 
Licensing, Reprints, Backfiles, and Other includes advertising, backfile sales, the licensing of publishing rights, journal and article reprints, and individual article sales. We generate advertising revenue from print and online journal subscription products, our online publishing platform, Literatum, online events such as webinars and virtual conferences, community interest websites such as spectroscopyNOW.com, and other websites.  A backfile license provides access to a historical collection of Wiley journals, generally for a one-time fee. We also engage with international publishers and receive licensing revenue from reproductions, translations, and other digital uses of our content. Journal and article reprints are primarily used by pharmaceutical companies and other industries for marketing and promotional purposes. Through the Article Select and PayPerView programs, we provide fee-based access to non-subscribed journal articles, content, book chapters, and major reference work articles. The Research Publishing business is also a provider of content and services in evidence-based medicine (EBM). Through our alliance with The Cochrane Collaboration, we publish The Cochrane Library, a premier source of high-quality independent evidence to inform healthcare decision-making. EBM facilitates the effective management of patients through clinical expertise informed by best practice evidence that is derived from medical literature.
INDEX


Research Platforms

Research Platforms is principally comprised of Atypon, a publishing software and service provider that enables scholarly and professional societies and publishers to deliver, host, enhance, market, and manage their content on the web through the Literatum platform. 

Literatum, our online publishing platform for societies and other research publishers, delivers integrated access to over 9 million articles from approximately 2,700 journals, as well as 25,000 online books and hundreds of multivolume reference works, laboratory protocols and databases.  The Literatum platform hosts over 45% of the world’s English language journals.

Academic & Professional Learning:

Our Academic & Professional Learning segment provides Education Publishing and Professional Learning products and services, including scientific, professional, and education print and digital books, digital courseware, and test preparation services, to libraries, corporations, students, professionals, and researchers, as well as learning, development, and assessment services for businesses and professionals. Communities served include business, finance, accounting, workplace learning, management, leadership, technology, behavioral health, engineering/ architecture, science and medicine, and education.  Products are developed for worldwide distribution through multiple channels, including chain and online booksellers, libraries, colleges and universities, corporations, direct to consumer, websites, distributor networks and other online applications. Publishing centers include Australia, Germany, India, the UK, and the US. Academic & Professional Learning accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated revenue in the year ended April 30, 2021, with a 25.4% Adjusted EBITDA margin. Approximately 54% of revenue is from digital and online products, and services.

Academic & Professional Learning revenue by product type includes Education Publishing and Professional Learning. The graphs below present revenue by product type for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020:
 

Key strategies for the Academic & Professional Learning business include developing and acquiring products and services to drive career-connected education, developing leading brands and franchises, executing strategic acquisitions and partnerships, and innovating digital content and courseware formats while expanding their global discoverability and distribution. We continue to implement strategies to manage declines in print revenue through cost improvement initiatives and focusing our efforts on growing our digital lines of business. We are continuing to perform portfolio reviews and workforce realignment, restructuring, and operational excellence initiatives. In certain areas, we will explore new formats or promote digital-only, and in other areas, we may rationalize our portfolio. Our approach is to continue to realign our cost structure to help mitigate the market changes that are contributing to revenue decline, and to sharpen our focus on high performing areas and digital opportunities, while improving operating efficiency.

Book sales for Education Publishing and Professional Learning are generally made on a returnable basis with certain restrictions. We provide for estimated future returns on sales made during the year based on historical return experience and current market trends.

Materials for book publications are obtained from authors throughout most of the world, utilizing the efforts of an editorial staff, outside editorial advisors, and advisory boards. Most materials are originated by the authors themselves or as the result of suggestion or solicitations by editors and advisors. We enter into agreements with authors that state the terms and conditions under which the materials will be published, the name in which the copyright will be registered, the basis for any royalties, and other matters. Most of the authors are compensated with royalties, which vary depending on the nature of the product. We may make advance royalty payments against future royalties to authors of certain publications. Royalty advances are reviewed for recoverability and a reserve for loss is maintained, if appropriate.

We continue to add new titles, revise existing titles, and discontinue the sale of others in the normal course of our business, and we also create adaptations of original content for specific markets based on customer demand. Our general practice is to revise our textbooks approximately every three years, if warranted, and to revise other titles as appropriate. Subscription-based products are updated on a more frequent basis.
  
INDEX

We generally contract with independent printers and binderies globally for their services. Management believes that adequate printing and binding facilities and sources of paper and other required materials are available to it, and that it is not dependent upon any single supplier.

In fiscal year 2016, we entered into an agreement to outsource our US based book distribution operations to Cengage Learning, with the continued aim of improving efficiency in our distribution activities and moving to a more variable cost model. As of April 30, 2021, we had one global warehousing and distribution facility remaining, which is in the UK.

Education Publishing
 
Education Publishing generates the majority of its revenue from contracts with its customers in the following revenue streams:
 
 
• | Education Publishing
--+---------------------


• | Digital Courseware
--+-------------------


• | Test Preparation and Certification
--+-----------------------------------


• | Licensing and Other
--+--------------------

Education Publishing

Education textbooks and related supplementary material and digital products are sold primarily to bookstores and online booksellers serving both for-profit and nonprofit educational institutions (primarily colleges and universities), and direct-to-students. We employ sales representatives who call on faculty responsible for selecting books to be used in courses, and on the bookstores that serve such institutions and their students. The textbook business is seasonal, with the majority of textbook sales occurring during the July-through-October and December-through-January periods. There are active used and rental print textbook markets, which adversely affect the sale of new textbooks. We are exploring opportunities to expand into the print rental market.

STM books (Reference) are sold and distributed globally in digital and print formats through multiple channels, including research libraries and library consortia, independent subscription agents, direct sales to professional society members, bookstores, online booksellers, and other customers.

We develop content in a digital format that can be used for both digital and print products, resulting in productivity and efficiency savings, and enabling print-on-demand delivery. Book content is available online through Wiley Online Library (delivered through our Literatum platform), WileyPLUS, zyBooks®, alta™, and other proprietary platforms. Digital books are delivered to intermediaries, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Ingram/Vital-Source®, for re-sale to individuals in various industry-standard formats, which are now the preferred deliverable for licensees of all types, including foreign language publishers. Digital books are also licensed to libraries through aggregators. Specialized formats for digital textbooks go to distributors servicing the academic market, and digital book collections are sold by subscription through independent third-party aggregators servicing distinct communities. Custom deliverables are provided to corporations, institutions, and associations to educate their employees, generate leads for their products, and extend their brands. Content from digital books is also used to create online articles, mobile apps, newsletters, and promotional collateral. This continual reuse of content improves margins, speeds delivery, and helps satisfy a wide range of customer needs. Our online presence not only enables us to deliver content online, but also to sell more books. The growth of online booksellers benefits us because they provide unlimited virtual “shelf space” for our entire backlist. Publishing alliances and franchise products are important to our strategy. Education and STM publishing (including Test Preparation) alliance partners include the AICPA, the CFA Institute, ACT (American College Test), IEEE, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and many others. The ability to join Wiley’s product development, sales, marketing, distribution, and technology with a partner’s content, technology, and/or brand name has contributed to our success.

Digital Courseware

We offer high-quality online learning solutions, including WileyPLUS, a research-based, online environment for effective teaching and learning that is integrated with a complete digital textbook. WileyPLUS improves student learning through instant feedback, personalized learning plans, and self-evaluation tools, as well as a full range of course-oriented activities, including online planning, presentations, study, homework, and testing. In selected courses, WileyPLUS includes a personalized adaptive learning component, Orion, which is based on cognitive science. Orion helps to build student proficiency on topics while improving the effectiveness of their study time. It assists educators in identifying areas that need reinforcement and measures student engagement and proficiency throughout the course.
INDEX

On July 1, 2019, Wiley acquired Zyante Inc., a leading provider of computer science and STEM education courseware. The highly-interactive zyBooks platform enables learners to learn by doing while allowing professors to be more efficient and devote more time to teaching. The platform maximizes learner engagement and retention through demonstration and hands-on learning experiences using interactive question sets, animations, tools, and embedded labs. The zyBooks platform will become an essential component of Wiley’s differentiated digital learning experience and, when combined with the acquisition of Knewton’s alta and adaptive learning technology in May 2019, will power lower-cost, higher-impact education across Wiley’s education business.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I)

Our DE&I strategy is embedded in everything we do and throughout the entire employee experience, with four key focus areas: Data-Driven Insights, Team Development, Inclusive Talent Processes, and Business Innovation. We stand for diversity in all forms, equity throughout our policies and processes, and an inclusive culture where people feel like they can be themselves. We established Employee Resource Groups supporting our diverse culture and leveraged a series of education and trainings on fostering an inclusive mindset. We signed the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, a commitment to sustained, concrete action to advance diversity and inclusive thinking, behavior, and business practices in the workplace.  We also proudly received a 100% score from the Human Rights Foundation for LGBTQ workplace equality.
Culture, Engagement & Learning

Investment in our colleague’s development and growth for both their current role and future roles is central to our culture. Wiley provides development programs, skill development courses and self-paced multi-language resources to help provide consistent learning offerings for our global communities. Leveraging Wiley’s CrossKnowledge platform, we offer interactive development programs which allow colleagues to share lessons learned, best practices and interactive opportunities with their peers. We also focused on higher-ed programs and certifications with our Wiley Beyond platform, which offers access to university programs as well as technical and industry-recognized certification programs.

On an annual basis, we conduct our Talent Review process with our executive team, focusing on our high performing talent, diversity, and succession for our most critical roles. We are committed to identifying, growing, and retaining top talent. We established key development action planning opportunities for each identified colleague to build our bench of future leaders.

Our culture differentiates us as an organization and our core values define our behaviors. We ask colleagues to embody our three values – Learning Champion, Needle Movers, and Courageous Teammates. We live by these values and they define who we are as a company and what we stand for. They enable us to build our culture internally—and show our customers, partners, and investors that what we believe in drives our business.  Our values empower our colleagues to achieve our mission of unlocking human potential.
