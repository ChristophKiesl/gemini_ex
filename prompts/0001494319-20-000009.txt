ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
We are a leading global chemical and ingredient distributor and provider of value-added services to customers across a wide range of diverse industries. We purchase chemicals and ingredients from thousands of chemical producers worldwide to warehouse, repackage, blend, dilute, transport and sell those chemicals to more than 100,000 customer locations across approximately 130 countries. We operate an extensive worldwide chemical and ingredient distribution network, comprised of more than 650 facilities and serviced by hundreds of tractors, railcars, tankers and trailers operating daily through our facilities.
Chemical and ingredient producers rely on us to warehouse, repackage, transport, and sell their products as a way to expand their market access, enhance their geographic reach, lower their cost to serve, and grow their business. Customers who purchase products and services from us benefit from a lower total cost of ownership, as they are able to simplify their chemical sourcing process by outsourcing functions to us such as “just-in-time delivery,” product availability and selection, packaging, mixing, blending and technical expertise. They also rely on us for safe and secure delivery and off-loading of chemicals fully compliant with increasing local and federal regulations.
Originally formed in 1924 as a brokerage business and through the continued expansion with various acquisitions, we were acquired in 2007 by investment funds advised by CVC Capital Partners Advisory (US), Inc. (“CVC”) and in 2010 by investment funds controlled by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”). We closed our initial public offering (“IPO”) on June 23, 2015. As of December 31, 2019, all of the foregoing investment funds have fully divested or reduced ownership in the Company and are no longer considered significant stockholders.
The effects of market conditions on our operations are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Recent Developments
On February 28, 2019, we acquired Nexeo Solutions, Inc. (“Nexeo”), a leading global chemicals and plastics distributor. The acquisition expanded and strengthened our presence in North America and provides expanded opportunities to create the largest North American sales force in chemical and ingredients distribution coupled with a broad and deep product offering.
On March 29, 2019, we sold the plastics distribution business of Nexeo to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC and on December 31, 2019, we sold our Environmental Sciences business to affiliates of AEA Investors LP.

The following graph reflects the breakdown by segment of our 2019 consolidated net sales of $9.3 billion.
USA
We supply a broad offering of commodity and specialty chemicals and ingredients, as well as specialized services to a wide range of end markets, touching a majority of the manufacturing and industrial production sectors in the United States. We believe our close proximity to customers, combined with our deep product knowledge and end market expertise, serves as a competitive advantage.
We repackage and blend bulk chemicals for shipment by our transportation fleet as well as common carriers. Our sales force is deployed through a geographic sales district model as well as by end-use market and industry (e.g., coatings and adhesives), food ingredients and products, pharmaceutical ingredients and products, personal care, homecare and industrial cleaning and energy (upstream, midstream and downstream).
Canada
Our Canadian operations are regionally focused, with a sales force supplying a broad offering of commodity and specialty chemicals and specialized services. We sell into the industrial, agricultural and energy markets. In agriculture, we formulate and distribute inoculants, crop protection and fertilizer products to independent retailers and specialty applicators servicing the agricultural end markets in both Western Canada and Eastern Canada and we provide support services to agricultural chemical producers throughout the country. In Eastern Canada, we primarily focus on industrial markets such as food ingredients, pharmaceutical ingredients, coatings and adhesives, and chemical manufacturing. We also service the cleaning and sanitation, personal care, mining, and energy markets. In Western Canada, we focus on forestry, chemical manufacturing, mining, and energy markets (e.g., midstream gas pipeline, oil sands processing and oil refining). 
EMEA
We maintain a strong presence in the United Kingdom and continental Europe with sales offices in 21 countries. We also have three sales offices in the Middle East and Africa.
We execute primarily on a pan-European basis, leveraging centralized or shared information technology systems, raw materials procurement, logistics, route operations and the management of producer relationships where possible to benefit from economies of scale and improve cost efficiency. We have strong end market expertise and key account management capability across Europe to better support sales representatives in each country and for serving our key customer end markets, in industrial production, pharmaceutical ingredients, food ingredients, coating and adhesives and personal care.
LATAM 
We offer generic and specialty chemicals and ingredients, as well as technical and market expertise, specialized services and key account management to a wide range of end markets including industrial production, personal care, coatings and adhesives, energy and agriculture through sales offices, Solution Centers and distribution sites in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and 
to a lesser extent the Asia-Pacific region. With the acquisition of Tagma Brasil Ltda. (“Tagma”) in 2017, we started to provide formulation services for crop protection manufacturers in Brazil.
Product and End Markets
We source and inventory chemicals and ingredients in large quantities such as barge loads, railcars or full truck loads from chemical producers and break down the bulk quantities to repackage, sell and distribute smaller quantities to our customers.
In addition to selling and distributing chemicals, we use our transportation and warehousing infrastructure, along with our broad knowledge of chemicals and hazardous materials handling to provide important distribution and specialized services for our producers and our customers.
We have state-of-the-art Solutions Centers at locations across the globe, consisting of formulation labs, development and research centers, and test kitchens, with specialized industry expertise and innovative technical capabilities to solve our customer's technical challenges and accelerate product development cycles.
Our key global end markets include:
•Agricultural. Within the agriculture industry we are a leading wholesale distributor of crop protection products to independent retailers and specialty applicators in Canada. To support this end market, we distribute herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, seed, seed treatments, inoculants, micronutrients, macronutrients, horticultural products and fertilizers among other products. In addition, we provide storage, packaging and logistics services for major crop protection companies.

Commodity chemicals and ingredients represent the largest portion of our business by sales and volume. Our commodity portfolio includes acids and bases, surfactants, glycols, inorganic compounds, alcohols and general chemicals used extensively throughout most end markets. Our specialty chemicals and ingredient sales represent an important, high-value, higher-growth portion of the chemical distribution market. We typically sell specialty products in lower volumes, but at a higher profit than commodity products.
Services
In addition to selling and distributing chemicals, we use our transportation and warehousing infrastructure, along with our broad knowledge of chemicals and hazardous materials handling, to provide distribution and specialized services for our producers and our customers. These services include:
•Chemical Waste Removal and Environmental Response Services. Our ChemCare waste management service collects both hazardous and non-hazardous waste products at customer locations in the United States and Canada, and then works with select vendors in the waste disposal business to safely transport these materials to licensed third party treatment, storage and disposal facilities. We also provide our customers with industrial cleaning, site remediation and emergency environmental response services.
•Inventory Management. We manage our inventory in order to meet customer demands on short notice whenever possible. Our value as channel partners of chemical producers also enables us to obtain access to chemicals in times of short supply, when smaller chemical distributors may not be able to obtain or maintain stock. Further, our global distribution network permits us to stock products locally to enhance “just-in-time” delivery, providing outsourced inventory management to our customers in a variety of end markets.
•Mixing, Blending and Repackaging. We provide a full suite of blending and repackaging services for our customers across diverse industries. Additionally, we can fulfill small orders through our repackaging services, enabling customers to maintain smaller inventories.
•Specialized Formulation and Blending. Leveraging our technical expertise, we are able to utilize our blending and mixing capabilities to create specialty chemical formulations to meet specific customer performance demands for agriculture and energy products.
Suppliers
We source materials from thousands of producers around the globe and we typically maintain relationships with multiple producers in order to protect against disruption in supply and distribution logistics, as well as to ensure competitive pricing of our supply. We typically maintain relationships with multiple producers in order to protect against disruption in supply and distribution logistics, as well as to ensure competitive pricing of our supply. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our 10 largest producers accounted for approximately 37% of our total chemical purchases.
Distribution Channels
We have multiple channels to market, including both warehouse delivery and direct-to-consumer delivery. The principal determinants of the way a customer is serviced include the size, scale and level of customization of a particular order, the nature of the product and the customer, and the location of the product inventories.
Warehouse distribution
Our warehouse distribution channel is the core of our operations and connects large producers with smaller volume customers whose consumption patterns tend to make them uneconomical to be served directly by producers. Thus, the core customer serviced via our warehouses is a small or medium-volume consumer of chemicals and ingredients. We purchase chemicals and ingredients in truck load or larger quantities from producers based on contracted demands of our customers and our estimates of anticipated customer purchases. Once received, products are stored in one or more of our distribution facilities for sale and distribution in smaller, less-than-truckload quantities to our customers. Our warehouses have various facilities for services such as repackaging, blending and mixing to create specialized solutions needed by our customers in ready-to-use formulations.
Direct distribution
In direct distribution, we sell and service large quantity purchases that are shipped directly from producers through our logistics infrastructure, which provides our customers with sourcing and logistics support services for inventory management and delivery.
Competition
The chemical and ingredient distribution and sales markets are highly competitive. Most of the products that we distribute are made to standard specifications and are either produced by or available from multiple sources.
Chemical and ingredient distribution itself is a fragmented market in which only a small number of competitors have substantial international operations. Our principal international competitor is Brenntag, which has a particularly strong position in Europe due to its strong market position in Germany.
Many other chemical distributors operate on a regional, national or local basis and may have a strong relationship with local producers and customers that may give them a competitive advantage in their local market, while others are niche players which focus on a specific end market, either industry or product-based. In addition to Brenntag, some of our regional competitors in North America include Helm America, Hydrite Chemical, Azelis, IMCD and Maroon Group and some of our regional competitors in Europe include Azelis, Helm and IMCD.
Chemical and ingredient producers may also sell their products through a direct sales force or through multiple chemical distributors, limit their use of third party distributors, particularly with respect to higher margin products, or to partner with other chemical and ingredient producers for distribution. Each of which could increase our competition.
We compete on the basis of service, on-time delivery, product breadth and availability, product and market knowledge and insights, safety and environmental compliance, global reach, product price, as well as our ability to provide certain additional value-added services.
Environmental Matters
We operate in a number of jurisdictions and are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, human health and safety, including laws regulating discharges of hazardous substances into the soil, air and water, blending, managing, handling, storing, selling, transporting and disposing of hazardous substances, investigation and remediation of contaminated properties and protecting the safety of our employees and others. Some of these laws and regulations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), among others. Some of our operations are required to hold environmental permits and licenses to be compliant and certain of our services businesses are also impacted by these laws. 
Information related to environmental matters is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including: (i) Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors; (ii) Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and (iii) “Note 2: Significant accounting policies” and “Note 21: Commitments and contingencies” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sustainability
We expect that there will be a continued increase in demand for products, systems and services that meet growing customer sustainability standards, expectations and preferences. We recognize that our ability to continue to provide these 
products and services requires our business to further advance environmentally and socially responsible means of operating, reflecting the challenges and opportunities presented through increased legal requirements, climate parameters and market developments. We believe that our ability to meet these increased sustainability demands will be necessary to enhance our competitive position in the marketplace.
Patents, Licenses and Trademarks
We consider intellectual property, particularly trade secrets, proprietary technology and other similar intellectual property, as important to our success. We hold some patents and have registered numerous trademarks in multiple jurisdictions. Further, we have various patent and trademark applications pending in jurisdictions worldwide. Although we consider our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and licenses to constitute valuable assets, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially dependent upon an individual patent, trademark, trade secret, or license.
Significant Customers
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in any of the years presented.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 10,300 employees on a full-time equivalent basis worldwide. 
Other
No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.
Because we generally fill orders upon receipt, no segment has any significant order backlog.
