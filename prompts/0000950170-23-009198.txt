 Item 1.  Business
 Overview and Strategy
 Cincinnati Bell Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Cincinnati Bell," "we," "our," "us" or the "Company") provide integrated communications and IT solutions that keep consumer and business customers connected with each other and with the world. The Company operates its businesses through the following segments: Network, previously referred to as Entertainment and Communications, and IT Services and Hardware. The Network segment serves customers in the Greater Cincinnati region through our altafiber brand and services customers in Hawaii through our Hawaiian Telcom brand. The IT Services and Hardware segment services customers in the U.S. and Europe through our CBTS brand and in Canada through our OnX brand.
 On March 13, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Red Fiber Parent LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), and RF Merger Sub Inc., an Ohio corporation and directly wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). On September 7, 2021 (the “Closing Date” or “Merger Date”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Ohio General Corporation Law (the “OGCL”), Merger Sub merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased, and the Company survived the Merger as a wholly owned private subsidiary of Parent.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of Cincinnati Bell’s issued and outstanding Common Shares was converted into the right to receive $15.50 per share in cash, without interest. Trading of the Company’s Common Shares was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and the Common Shares were subsequently delisted from the NYSE. Additionally, the Company redeemed Depositary Shares simultaneously with the redemption of the 6 /% Preferred Shares, at a redemption price of $50 per Depositary Share (equivalent to $1,000 per 6 /% Preferred Share), and the Depositary Shares were then delisted from the NYSE. As a result of the Merger Agreement, the Company has ceased to be a registrant (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements); however, due to contractual provisions in certain indentures, the Company is required to voluntarily file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K provides an overview of Cincinnati Bell Inc.'s financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, the periods January 1, 2021 through September 7, 2021 and September 8, 2021 through December 31, 2021, and the year ended December 31, 2020. References in this Annual Report to “Successor” refer to the Company on or after September 8, 2021 and references to “Predecessor” refer to the results prior to September 8, 2021. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.
 Our results of operations as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements for these periods are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Although GAAP requires that we report on our results for the period from January 1, 2021 through September 7, 2021 and the period from September 8, 2021 through December 31, 2021 separately, management views the Company’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021 by combining the results of the applicable Predecessor and Successor periods because such presentation provides the most meaningful comparison of our results to current and prior periods.
 To enhance the analysis of our operating results for the periods presented, we have included a discussion of selected financial and operating data of the Predecessor and Successor on a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2021. This presentation consists of the mathematical addition of selected financial and operating data of the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2021 to September 7, 2021 plus the comparable financial and operating data of the Successor for the period from September 8, 2021 to December 31, 2021. There are no other adjustments made in the combined presentation. The mathematical combination of selected financial and operating data is included below under the heading "Combined Year Ended December 31, 2021" and this data is a non-GAAP presentation. Management believes that this selected financial and operating data provides investors with useful information upon which to assess our operating performance because the results of operations for a twelve-month period correspond to how we have reported our results in the past and how we will report our results in the future.

Through its Network segment, the Company provides high-speed data, video, and voice solutions to consumers and businesses over an expanding fiber network and a legacy copper network. During 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc. ("Hawaiian Telcom"), the largest full service provider of communication services on all of Hawaii's major islands. This acquisition added operational scale to our business by adding access to both Honolulu, a well-developed, fiber-rich city on Oahu, as well as the growing neighbor islands. As a result of the acquisition, the Company's combined fiber networks are approximately 20,400 fiber route miles. On May 2, 2022, the Company acquired Agile IWG Holdings, LLC ("Agile") for total cash consideration of $65.5 million. Agile delivers customers, primarily located in Ohio and Pennsylvania, with middle mile, last mile and campus connectivity services through hybrid fiber wireless networks that are designed, built and managed by Agile.
 Through its IT Services and Hardware segment, business customers across the U.S., Canada and Europe rely on the Company for the sale and service of efficient, end-to-end communications and IT systems and solutions.
 Our goal is to continue the transformation of Cincinnati Bell from a legacy copper-based telecommunications company into a technology company with state-of-the-art fiber assets servicing customers with data, video, voice and IT solutions to meet their evolving needs.
In an effort to achieve our objectives, we continue to focus on the following key initiatives:
 •expand our fiber network; and
 •grow our IT Services and Hardware segment.
 Expand our fiber network
 During 2022, we invested $306.6 million of capital in the Network segment in products that can be categorized as Fioptics, previously referred to as "Consumer/SMB Fiber" in Hawaii and collectively with Fioptics in Cincinnati. Revenue from these high demand products totaled $527.9 million for 2022, up $54.3 million compared to the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 partially mitigating the decline in legacy products. The primary focus of these investments is the expansion of high-speed internet products which are designed to compete directly with the cable Multiple System Operators, such as Charter Communications, serving the Company’s operating territories. Year-over-year revenue and subscribers for these products are outlined in the table below:

During the year, we passed an additional 73,900 addresses in the Greater Cincinnati area with Fioptics, which included a focus on Fiber to the Premise ("FTTP") addresses as FTTP has become a more relevant solution for our customers. As of December 31, 2022, the Fioptics products are now available to approximately 733,000 customer locations or more than 85% of the Greater Cincinnati operating territory. During 2022, we passed an additional 48,500 addresses in Hawaii. The Fioptics products are now available to approximately 327,800 addresses, or more than 50% of the operating territory in Hawaii, including Oahu and the neighbor islands.
 In 2022, the Company also invested $40.4 million in Enterprise Fiber products, which includes fiber and IP-based core network technology as well as expenditures for Agile. These investments position the Company to meet increased business and carrier demand within Greater Cincinnati and in the Midwest region. In Hawaii, expenditures are for high-bandwidth data transport products, such as metro-ethernet, including the Southeast Asia to United States ("SEA-US") cable. We continue to evolve and optimize network assets to support the migration of legacy products to new technology, and as of December 31, 2022, the Company has:
 •increased the total number of commercial addresses with fiber-based services (referred to as a lit address) to 36,200 in Greater Cincinnati and 27,300 in Hawaii by connecting approximately 4,700 additional lit addresses in Greater Cincinnati and 4,900 additional lit addresses in Hawaii during 2022;
 •expanded the fiber network to span more than 14,600 route miles in Greater Cincinnati and 5,800 route miles in Hawaii; and
 •provided cell site back-haul services to approximately 90% of the 1,075 cell sites in the Greater Cincinnati market, all of which are lit with fiber, and approximately 90% of the 1,120 cell sites in Hawaii, nearly all of which are lit with fiber.
 In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire inter-island submarine and middle-mile terrestrial fiber infrastructure assets in Hawaii owned by the bankruptcy estate of the Paniolo Cable Company, LLC. The transaction closed in August 2021 for an amount of $52.3 million, inclusive of transaction costs. The Company's expanding fiber assets allow us to support the ever-increasing demand for data, video and internet devices with speed, agility and security. We believe our fiber investments are a long-term solution for our customers' bandwidth needs.
 Grow our IT Services and Hardware Segment
 Cincinnati Bell continues to grow the IT Services and Hardware segment by developing new products as well as expanding its reach to new customers. As a result of both organic and inorganic growth, our geographic footprint now extends across the U.S., Canada, Europe and India. We continue to diversify our customer base and expand our product portfolio. The Company continues to develop high-demand products for business customers through our investments in unified communications and cloud services. Our ability to be innovative and to react to the changing technology demands of our customers is important to the growth of our IT Services and Hardware segment. Our offerings under the Infrastructure Solutions practice provide a platform for buyer engagement and an opportunity for connecting the customer to higher value professional and managed services.
 As a company with a long history of managing customers' network and technology needs, we combine the management of the network, whether owned or leased from other carriers out of territory, with integrated voice and IT offerings. We supply the architecture and integration intelligence, labor and hardware as well as any combination of these services. These projects can be established based on hourly billing rates, service-level driven agreements or utility-based managed service models. Customers are attracted to our ability to combine our historic knowledge, unique assets and talented workforce in order to help them improve their operational efficiency, mitigate risk and reduce costs.

Network
 
The Network segment provides products and services such as high-speed internet, data transport, local voice, video and other services. Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC ("CBT"), a subsidiary of the Company, is the incumbent local exchange carrier ("ILEC") for a geography that covers a radius of approximately 25 miles around Cincinnati, Ohio, and includes parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. CBT has operated in this territory for approximately 150 years. In 2022, the Company started their network expansion outside of this territory to provide fiber services to Dayton, Ohio. Voice and data services in the Enterprise Fiber and Legacy categories that are delivered beyond the Company's ILEC territory, particularly in Dayton and Mason, Ohio, are provided through the operations of Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories LLC ("CBET"), a subsidiary of CBT. Hawaiian Telcom, a subsidiary of the Company, is the ILEC for the State of Hawaii and the largest full service provider of communications services and products in that state. Originally incorporated in Hawaii in 1883 as Mutual Telephone Company, Hawaiian Telcom has a strong heritage of nearly 140 years as Hawaii’s communications carrier. Its services are offered on all of Hawaii’s major islands, except its video service, which currently is only available on the island of Oahu. On May 2, 2022, the Company acquired Agile, based in Canton, Ohio. Agile leases wireless infrastructure assets to third parties and provides connectivity through hybrid fiber wireless data networks primarily to customers in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The key products and services provided by the Network segment include the following:
Data
 The Company's data products include high-speed internet access, data transport and interconnection services. Consumer demand for increased internet speeds is accelerating, and more customers are opting for higher bandwidth solutions. To address this demand, the Company is focused on building out new FTTP addresses as well as overlaying FTTN addresses, enabling these addresses to receive speeds up to one gigabit per second ("Gbps"). FTTP addresses now cover nearly 80% of the market in Greater Cincinnati and more than 40% of the market in Hawaii, of which approximately 657,200 and 268,000 addresses are capable of receiving speeds up to one Gbps in Greater Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively.
 As business customers migrate from legacy products and copper-based technology, our metro-ethernet product becomes the access method of choice due to its ability to support multiple applications on a single physical connection. We are also expanding our metro-ethernet platform to deliver services across a wider geography to target business customers beyond our ILEC footprint. The Company’s regional network connects Greater Cincinnati, Columbus, and Dayton, Ohio, as well as Indianapolis, Indiana, Chicago, Illinois, and Louisville, Kentucky.
 As a result of the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, the Company gained access to the SEA-US trans-Pacific submarine cable system connecting Indonesia, the Philippines, Guam, Hawaii and the mainland United States. The system provides an initial 20 Terabytes per second ("Tbps") of capacity using state-of-the-art 100 Gbps technology to accommodate the increase in data consumption.
 Voice
 Voice represents local service over both copper and fiber. It also includes consumer long distance, digital trunking, switched access and other value-added services such as caller identification, voicemail, call waiting and call return.
 The Company's voice access lines over copper continue to decrease as its customers have increasingly employed wireless technologies in lieu of wireline voice services ("wireless substitution"), migrated to competitors, or migrated to VoIP services provided by the Company and others.
 Customers purchasing traditional long distance service can choose from a variety of long distance plans, which include unlimited long distance for a flat fee, purchase of minutes at a per-minute-of-use rate, or a fixed number of minutes for a flat fee. The Company's long distance lines and related minutes of use have continued to decline as a result of wireless substitution.
 Video
 In the Greater Cincinnati territory, the Company launched Fioptics in 2009 and initially focused our fiber network investment on densely populated areas, such as apartments and condominiums. Since that time, Fioptics has been deployed over a much broader base and is now available to more than 85% of Greater Cincinnati. As of December 31, 2022, we have 123,100 video subscribers in Greater Cincinnati. Our Fioptics customers enjoy access to over 400 entertainment channels, including digital music, local, movie and sports programming with over 150 high-definition channels, parental controls, HD DVR and video On-Demand.

In Hawaii, the Company launched its next-generation television service on the island of Oahu in July 2011. The TV service is 100% digital with hundreds of local, national, international and music channels, including high-definition, premium, pay-per-view channels and video on-demand service. TV service has been deployed to 36,000 subscribers in Hawaii as of the end of 2022.
 Other
 Other revenue consists of revenue generated from wiring projects for business customers, support from the Connect America Fund and Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (see “Regulatory Matters and Competitive Trends” for further discussion of universal service), advertising, directory assistance, maintenance and information services. Beginning in 2021, Other revenue also includes subsidized fiber build project revenue related to extending the Company’s fiber network in the Greater Cincinnati territory subsidized through our UniCity program. Subsidized fiber build project revenue related to extending the Company's fiber network in Hawaii is included in Other revenue beginning in 2022.
 IT Services and Hardware
 The IT Services and Hardware segment provides a full range of managed IT solutions, telephony and IT equipment sales, and professional IT staffing services. These services and products are provided through the Company's subsidiaries in various geographic areas throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and India. By offering a full range of Infrastructure Solutions in addition to Cloud, Communications and Consulting services, the IT Services and Hardware segment provides end-to-end IT solutions designed to reduce cost and mitigate risk while optimizing performance for its customers.
 The key products and services provided by the IT Services and Hardware segment include the following:
 Consulting
 The Company's consulting services offerings consist of IT staffing and project-based engagements, including engineering and installation of voice, connectivity and IT technologies, development of digital application solutions and staff augmentation by highly skilled and industry-certified technical resources. Engagements can be short-term IT implementation and project-based work as well as longer term staffing and permanent placement assignments. The Company utilizes a team of experienced recruiting and hiring personnel to provide its customers with a wide range of skilled IT professionals. These professionals are comprised of employees and contractors located in the U.S., Canada, Europe and India.
Communications
 The Company offers a complete portfolio of hosted solutions that include converged IP communications platforms of data, voice, video and mobility applications. We offer our customers expert management for all hardware and software components, including maintenance contracts and service level agreement ("SLA") based services. Fully hosted and managed, these voice platforms and applications can also be delivered as a service for a monthly utility fee allowing our customers to scale without a large capital investment.
 The solutions offered in the Communications practice include UCaaS, SD-WAN, NaaS, Contact Center and other Networking Solutions. UCaaS provides a portfolio of solutions that includes VoIP, room-based video, mobile solutions, chat/presence, messaging, web conferencing, audio conferencing, social media, contact center solutions, and more in order to serve a customer's collaboration needs. Cloud delivered SD-WAN is a revolutionary, agile platform to deploy, manage and monitor hybrid public, private, wireline and wireless networks. NaaS is a fully managed networking solution with cloud integration, security, switching, Wi-Fi, management, monitoring and SD-WAN. Our Contact Center offering features speech-enabled Interactive Voice Response ("IVR"), call-back services, call analytics and surveys, speech analytics, alerts and notification, and improved customer satisfaction and productivity. Additionally, we manage the maintenance of a large base of customers with traditional voice systems as well as converged VoIP systems under Networking Solutions.
 Cloud
 Virtual data center ("VDC") is a robust and scalable virtual infrastructure consisting of equipment, security, people and processes. This offering is provided in three different models - private cloud, dedicated cloud or public cloud - and provides customers with either a long-term or a short-term flexible solution that is fully managed by the Company and monitored around the clock from its Enterprise Network Operations Center ("ENOC").

Form 10-K Part I | Cincinnati Bell Inc.

 
Storage is a flexible, on-demand solution that enables businesses to eliminate capital expenditures and ongoing asset management with SLA-based services. The Company offers Tier I, Tier II and Tier III storage to meet its customers' availability, accessibility, protection, performance and capacity needs.
 Backup is a scalable solution that allows businesses to eliminate capital outlay and ongoing equipment management with SLA-based services and includes virtual data center, hardware, software, monitoring and support.
 The Company provides SLA-based monitoring and management services utilizing its ENOC. The ENOC includes highly certified engineers and operation experts that proactively monitor and manage our customers’ technology environments and applications. Standalone monitoring services provide customers with scheduled and automatic checks of customers' servers, routers, switches, load balancers and firewalls. We also provide customers with advance trouble shooting, repair and changes of customers' servers, routers, switches, load balancers and other network devices from our ENOC. These services can be provided to customers with equipment provided by the Company or customer-owned equipment and do not have geographical constraints. Services can be purchased individually or bundled by combining multiple products, services, and assets into a utility or service model.
 Infrastructure Solutions
 The Company maintains premium resale relationships and certifications with a variety of branded technology vendors which allows it to competitively sell, architect and install a wide array of telecommunications and IT infrastructure equipment to meet the needs of its customers.
Sales and Distribution Channels
 The Company’s Network segment utilizes a number of distribution channels to acquire customers. As of December 31, 2022, the Company operated seven retail stores in the Greater Cincinnati area and one retail store in Dayton, Ohio to market and distribute our Fioptics suite of products. The Company works to locate retail stores in high traffic but affordable areas, with a distance between each store that considers optimal returns per store and customer convenience. The Company also offers fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of various other Company services and accessories for both the Cincinnati operating territory and the Hawaii operating territory. In addition, the Company utilizes a call center, as well as a door-to-door sales force, to target the sale of our consumer products to residents.
 For both operating segments, we utilize a business-to-business sales force and a call center organization to reach business customers in our operating territories. Larger business customers are supported by sales account representatives and solution architects located in our branch offices across the U.S., Canada and Europe that understand the customer's technology needs and recommend Company-offered solutions. Smaller business customers are supported through a telemarketing sales force, customer representatives and store locations.
 The IT Services and Hardware segment utilizes an indirect distribution channel to sell services, primarily focused on Communications. Compensation to the distributor is success-based and typically involves a residual payment based on revenue from customers.
 Suppliers and Product Supply Chain
 The Company generally subjects purchases to competitive bids and selects its vendors based on price, service level, delivery terms, quality of product and terms and conditions.
 The Network segment's primary purchases are for video content, network equipment, software, fiber cable and contractors to maintain and support the growth of the fiber network. The Company maintains facilities and operations for storing cable and other equipment, product distribution and customer fulfillment.



Form 10-K Part I | Cincinnati Bell Inc.

 
The Company purchases some of its programming directly from the program networks by entering into affiliation agreements with the programming suppliers. The Company also benefits from membership with the National Cable Television Cooperative (“NCTC”), which enables us to take advantage of volume discounts. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 70% of Cincinnati’s programming was sourced from the NCTC and approximately 50% of Hawaiian Telcom’s programming was sourced from the NCTC.
The IT Services and Hardware segment primarily purchases IT and telephony equipment that is either sold to a customer or used to provide service to the customer. The Company is a certified distributor of leading technology and software solutions including, but not limited to, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and IBM. Most of this equipment is shipped directly to the customer from vendor locations, but the Company does maintain warehouse facilities for replacement parts and equipment testing and staging.
 In addition, we have long-term commitments to outsource various services, such as certain information technology functions, cash remittance and accounts payable functions, call center operations and maintenance services.
 Competition
 The telecommunications industry is competitive, and the Company competes against larger, well-capitalized national providers.
 The Network segment faces competition from other local exchange carriers, wireless service providers, inter-exchange carriers, as well as cable, broadband, internet and fixed wireless service providers. The Company has lost, and will likely continue to lose, access lines as a portion of the customer base migrates to competitive wireline or wireless providers in lieu of the Company’s services. Wireless providers, particularly those that provide unlimited wireless service plans with no additional fees for long distance, offer customers a substitution service for the Company’s local voice and long-distance services. The Company believes wireless substitution and competition is the reason for the largest portion of the Company’s access line and long-distance line losses.
 Our Fioptics and Enterprise Fiber products also face intense competition from cable operators, other telecom companies and niche fiber companies. Many of our competitors have lower operating costs and access to resources that provide economies of scale that allow them to more aggressively price products, as well as provide products on a much broader scale given their expanded geographic operations. Our competitors continuously upgrade their service quality and offerings which could substantially erode the competitive advantage we currently have with our fiber-based products. These competitive factors could limit the Company's ability to grow revenue and cash flows despite the strategic initiatives implemented.
 
The Company's video product also faces competition from a number of different sources, including companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Increasingly, content owners are utilizing Internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee for access to the content.
 Furthermore, due to consumer electronics innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices. Increased customer migration to these non-traditional entertainment products could result in increased churn and decreased penetration for video; however, this trend could also drive increased demand for our high-speed internet product.



Form 10-K Part I | Cincinnati Bell Inc.

 
The IT Services and Hardware segment competes against numerous information technology consulting, web-hosting, and computer system integration companies, many of which are larger in scope and well-financed. The Company believes that participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve significant scale to compete effectively. Other competitors may consolidate with larger companies or acquire software application vendors or technology providers, enabling them to more effectively compete. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede the ability of these businesses to compete successfully in the market. In addition, as more customers migrate to the public cloud, we expect to see declines in the demand for Infrastructure Solutions. However, this trend could provide an opportunity in Consulting, Communications and Cloud Services as the Company has IT professionals that can assist customers through this migration to the public cloud.
 Customers
 The Company had no customers whose revenue comprised greater than 10% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, the combined Predecessor and Successor periods included within 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) comprised 21% and 26% of consolidated accounts receivable, respectively. The accounts receivable with Verizon are significant to the Company, but the associated revenue does not exceed 10% of total revenue as a result of the application of ASC 606 and management’s conclusion that for hardware transactions we act as the agent and, as a result, record revenue net of the cost of product.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 5,800 employees. Approximately 22% of its employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 12% of total employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the Communications Workers of America (“CWA”), which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, and approximately 10% of total employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1357. The collective bargaining agreements with the CWA and IBEW are effective until the second quarter of 2026 and third quarter of 2028, respectively.
 The Company knows that our people are our most valuable assets and is committed to investing in them and their success. We have developed various programs and practices to support, develop and care for our employees throughout their careers with the Company.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion – The Company believes in the transformative power of connectivity, and we believe connections are made stronger when we embrace the diversity in our employees. It is our mission to create an environment that celebrates the unique qualities of those around us and empowering all employees to reach their full potential. We are committed to employing diversity and inclusion efforts that align with our values, such as talent development and progressive hiring practices which will help drive increased representation of underrepresented groups across the organization. In addition, we are committed to developing fair systems, procedures and resource distribution to ensure that we create equitable opportunities for all employees. The Company has dedicated staff focused on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts throughout the organization.
 Professional Development – Investing in the development of our people is a core value of the Company. As a result, the Company continually seeks to offer new and innovative ways to provide development opportunities to our employees throughout their careers including, but not limited to, on-demand training for both professional and industry-specific skills through our intranet site, certification programs to encourage employees to develop and enhance skills, technical talent programs to provide technical leadership and define job enrichment opportunities across the organization and leadership development programs to enable employees to grow and progress on the leadership path.


Form 10-K Part I | Cincinnati Bell Inc.

 
Employee Engagement – The Company seeks to create and communicate engagement opportunities for all employees for increased development and retention through surveys, periodic town hall meetings with leadership and other forms of direct employee feedback. In addition, the Company sponsors several resource groups which we believe are the cornerstone for personal and professional enrichment and are also integral to the exploration of diversity and inclusion in our workplace. Employees are encouraged to partner with the Company to pursue areas of passion including community outreach activities and volunteer programs.
 Safety – The Company is focused on establishing safety as a core value among employees with the primary goal that every employee returns home safely at the end of the day. This applies not only to our field technicians and warehouse personnel but also to our employees working in an office environment. As a result, the Company has hired additional staff to increase safety training, observations and assist in building our overall safety culture.
Compensation and Benefits – The Company is committed to rewarding and supporting our employees, and therefore, we offer a comprehensive compensation program that includes market-competitive pay, healthcare benefits, a retirement savings plan, tuition reimbursement programs, and paid time off and family leave.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These include having the vast majority of our employees work from home starting in March 2020 and continuing to offer employees the option of a hybrid work environment.
