Item 1. Business
Hostess - Who We Are
We are a leading packaged food company focused on developing, manufacturing, selling and distributing baked goods in North America. The Company produces a variety of new and classic treats including Hostess® CupCakes, Twinkies®, Donettes®, Ding Dongs®, and Zingers® in addition to Danishes, Honey Buns and Coffee Cakes. In January 2020, the Company acquired Voortman Cookies, Limited (“Voortman”), which produces a variety of cookies and wafer products, including sugar-free products under the Voortman® brand. Our strategic vision is to be an iconic branded baking company that builds brands and categories to delight our consumers and customers. We seek to leverage our differentiated core competencies of strong brand equity, continuous innovation, efficient manufacturing and distribution model, collaborative customer partnerships, and significant cash flows to drive profitable and sustainable growth by engaging consumers with our sweet baked goods while seeking opportunities in adjacent bakery categories. 
We operate in the growing snacking market where indulgent, sweet snacking continues to be a top driver. Our brands represented 18.8% of the Sweet Baked Goods (“SBG”) category according to Nielsen total universe for the 52-weeks ended December 28, 2019. We believe our strong brand history and market position in the SBG category combined with our entrepreneurial spirit and scalable operating model provide a strong platform to execute our strategic initiatives. 
We have invested significantly in retailer and consumer data analysis to identify distribution and pricing opportunities and in automated baking and packaging lines to enhance production efficiency. These investments, combined with our Direct-to-Warehouse (“DTW”) distribution model, have maintained our leading, premium brand position within the $6.8 billion U.S. SBG category and have increased our distribution channels, paving a path towards future sustainable, profitable growth.
Our DTW distribution model uses centralized distribution centers and common carriers to fill orders, with products generally delivered to our customers’ warehouses. This model has eliminated the need for Direct-Store-Delivery (“DSD”) routes and drivers, which allows us to expand our core distribution while gaining access to new channels (e.g., further penetration into convenience, drug store, dollar, foodservice, and cash & carry). 
Brands and Products
Hostess® has been an iconic American brand for generations. In 2019, we celebrated our 100 year anniversary of the launch of our first CupCake. Our extensive portfolio of timeless and universally recognized names such as Twinkies®, HoHos® and Ding Dongs® evoke an emotional affinity with consumers that has the potential to be further unlocked through effective marketing and consumer-insight based innovation. We produce Hostess®, Dolly Madison®, Cloverhill® and Big Texas® branded products. Each brand targets different key markets and consumer needs. Additionally, we added the Voortman® brand to our portfolio in January 2020.
Our Growth Strategy
We are executing our growth strategy by strengthening our core Hostess® brand and expanding into adjacent categories through innovation and strong partnerships with our customers, leveraging our highly efficient and profitable business model and executing strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth, while effectively managing our capital structure.
Optimize the core Hostess Brand and expand into adjacent categories 
We believe that we have maintained the Hostess® brand power and category awareness for over a century by satisfying consumers’ need for great-tasting sweet treats. We believe our portfolio of highly recognized products is synonymous with American snacking. We have established our leadership position in the SBG segment through the strength and quality of our products, developing and promoting a brand that unites our loyal consumer base and by pricing our products at a reasonable premium to other snacking alternatives. 
We plan to capitalize on the strength of the Hostess® brand and our attractive retailer economics in order to drive growth by attracting new consumers and increasing the number of stores carrying our products. With the potential afforded by the extended reach of our DTW distribution model, our market share gains are expected to come from traditional channels (“core expansion”) through our investment in quality, targeted marketing, product renovation and a focus on our most effective brands and SKUs. 
Our brand strategy, combined with investments in highly effective marketing and brand-building, has resulted in what we believe to be one of the strongest brand equities in snacking. By expanding points of distribution and increasing SKU assortments, we plan to continue top line growth in the future. Our top three products (Donettes®, Twinkies® and CupCakes) have all commodity volume (“ACV”) distribution rates in core channels that are significantly higher than the average rate achieved by other products in our portfolio (based on Nielsen 52-weeks ending December 28, 2019). These high levels are directly correlated to our focused approach on our strategic initiatives. By applying this tailored and focused approach to our other existing product lines, we will work with retailers to expand the average number of SKUs offered and attempt to reduce distribution gaps. The average number of our products selling at core retailers today is approximately 23 items.
Innovation is key to fueling our growth. We are devoted to maintaining our iconic brands while contemporizing them in order to stay relevant with our consumer base and attract new consumers. We believe that to support our premium position, we must continually evolve with changing consumer preferences and trends. We are focused on continuing to innovate and expand our core products by launching new flavors of iconic products to leverage the brand’s power and drive incremental revenue and profit.The success of our product innovation is in part driven by understanding consumer preferences, providing awareness and trials by partnering with our customers, all while maintaining our iconic brands and product quality. 
We are driving incremental growth in the Hostess® brand through extensions of our core products and limited time offerings. During 2019, we had great success with our Birthday CupCake. Originally created as a limited time offering to celebrate our 100 year anniversary, it was quickly added to our core product portfolio due to high consumer demand. The Birthday CupCake is now our #2 selling CupCake flavor. New products such as Triple Chocolate Brownies and Totally Nutty® expand the Hostess® brand into new consumer segments. Fun seasonable items such as Baseball CupCakes, Mint Chocolate Twinkies as well as other limited time offerings tied to cultural trends such as Unicorn CupCakes and Fruitfetti Donettes®, continue to engage our target consumers and provide a fresh perspective to the brand.
During 2019, the breakfast sub-category also provided a significant opportunity for us to expand our total share of the SBG category. This sub-category represents approximately 52% of the $6.8 billion SBG category according to Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52-weeks ended December 28, 2019. According to a January 2019 study by Mintel, breakfast was one of the top consumer snacking opportunities. These consumption trends play to our strengths as our products conveniently come packaged in both single-serve and multipack varieties. The acquisition of the Cloverhill® Business in 2018 enabled us to leverage our existing platform and to expand our breakfast capabilities in this significant consumer segment. In 2019, we launched our new Hostess® Cinnamon Rolls, Danishes and Jumbo Donettes®. We also launched additional pack-types for our classic breakfast treats, such as the snack size Donettes®, which are addressing consumer needs for on the go products. 
We continue to launch new partnerships and enter into licensing agreements to leverage our iconic brands. During 2019, we partnered with other consumer packaged goods companies to bring our iconic brands and flavor profiles to various products, including coffee and breakfast cereal. Our products are also distributed by third parties internationally, including products packed specifically for Mexico, the United Kingdom and Canada. Our products are also sold on various e-commerce platforms.
We understand the need to continually evolve while maintaining the traditional offerings our loyal consumer base has come to know and love. We continue to invest in new product development and building our long-term pipeline, leveraging our innovation pipeline and commercialization process to bring new products to market in a timely fashion. 
Leverage highly efficient and profitable business model
When we relaunched the Company, we set out to disrupt the status quo business model of the SBG category. We established our innovative DTW distribution model and heavily invested in our bakeries, which has resulted in energy, labor and time savings, along with the ability to produce quality products. These investments also paved the way for new product innovation. 
The DTW model uses centralized distribution centers and common carriers. During 2019, we entered into a lease for a new primary distribution center and successfully transitioned a significant portion of the shipments of our products to the new facility in Kansas. Our former primary distribution center was managed by a third party provider, while our new distribution center will be managed internally. This in-sourcing has improved visibility and control of this key component of our operating model. We continue to utilize other smaller distribution centers that are owned and operated by third parties for select products. The distribution centers are able to fill customer orders and reduce inventory on-hand as a result of this centralized consolidation of inventory. Products are delivered to customers’ warehouses from the distribution centers using common carriers. A small number of our customers pick up their orders directly from our distribution centers. 
The DTW model is enabled by our extended shelf life (“ESL”) technology. As a result of our DTW model, we do not keep a significant backlog of finished goods inventory, as our bakery products are promptly shipped to our distribution centers after being produced. Some of our products are shipped frozen at the request of certain retailers.
We believe our DTW distribution model has created a substantial whitespace opportunity. We have greater access to convenience, drug and dollar stores. Distributing to these channels under a DSD model can be inefficient due to small average drop size. Historically, DSD snack cake companies have competed with candy and tobacco companies 
for distribution; however, our DTW model has enabled us to partner with these third-party distributors who can profitably penetrate both the convenience store and drug store channels and who are looking for opportunities to gain share in the SBG category. In 2019, convenience and drug stores accounted for 31.5% of our net revenues. We have established a strong presence and market share in the convenience and drug channels and are focused on continuously expanding coverage. These partnerships further expand our distribution reach in a highly efficient manner, and we believe they will add to our growth potential going forward.
We have a tailored channel based go-to-market model that demonstrates key capabilities for growth. We continue to invest in data capabilities, which enables focus on store-level compliance and growth opportunities with our Hostess Partner Program (“HPP”). We also have a unique consortium retail merchandising approach where we partner with brokers to drive in-store performance at lower costs.
We believe that impulse purchase decisions are another fundamental driver of retail sales of our products, which makes prominent in-store placement an essential growth lever. The DTW and centralized distribution model provide us with a competitive advantage through the ability to utilize retail-ready corrugate displays. These pre-built displays are visually impactful, produced economically, and require minimal in-store labor to assemble or load, thus providing cost-efficient display vehicles that benefit both us and the retailer. Preloaded displays also allow us full control over our brand marketing, which allows us to execute retailer-wide campaigns regionally or nationally in a consistent manner, providing a unique competitive advantage across the entire SBG category, which is predominantly DSD-served.
Our business model is supported by cost-advantaged manufacturing and distribution, expanded channel/retail store reach and enhanced in-store merchandising capabilities, and offers our retail partners attractive margins that incentivize further distribution of our products.
We have continued to invest in the business since the re-launch in 2013 and anticipate continued investment in the business to further our strategic initiatives. Our disciplined capital investment focus will be on operational capabilities that directly support or expand our growth and innovation with strong return on investment metrics. Further, we anticipate continued investment in automation, which allows for improved product quality, consistency and efficiency. 
Platform for acquisitions
We have a solid platform for growth through acquisitions. Within the fragmented consumer packaged goods market, the opportunity exists to drive value creation through acquisitions by leveraging our brand, infrastructure and performance-driven management culture. We are committed to seeking-out opportunities that add new capabilities to our already broad offerings. 
The 2018 acquisition and integration of the Cloverhill® business in Chicago, Illinois, is another example where we are leveraging our warehouse model and expanding our breakfast capabilities. The transformation and significant capital investment we have made in this facility have provided us with a platform to leverage our brand in the breakfast sub-category. Net revenue from the sale of Hostess® products through the club channel increased 44.7% from the prior year, demonstrating our ability to leverage customer relationships acquired from the Cloverhill® business to drive sales in our core product portfolio.
On August 30, 2019, we sold the In-Store Bakery operations in order to provide more focus on future investments in areas of our business that better leverage our core competencies. We sold the In-Store Bakery operations for $65.0 million, subject to post-closing adjustments.
The acquisition of Voortman in January 2020 diversifies and expands our product offerings and manufacturing capabilities in the attractive, adjacent $7.8 billion cookie category based on Nielsen data as of December 28, 2019. The Voortman® brand and its unique product offerings have the #1 share of the sugar-free and wafer segments within this category. The acquisition also leverages our broad customer reach and lean and agile business model. The combined company expects to realize additional benefits of scale via sharing established, efficient infrastructure and strengthening of collaborative retail partnerships in the United States and Canada. We expect the transaction to 
deliver on key growth opportunities while achieving significant cost synergies within the first 12 - 18 months following the close of the transaction. 
As we explore other opportunities, we will consider our ability to leverage our existing brands or reinvigorate acquired brands within the snacking category. We will also consider our ability to integrate acquisitions with our existing business and the opportunities to generate synergies through leveraging of our existing assets and warehouse model. We believe our scale, access to capital and management experience will allow us to consider acquisitions in the future and to efficiently integrate them.
The Category: Large and Attractive
The average American is snacking 3-5 times per day and the larger snacking market is expected to grow by 20% between 2018 and 2022 according to Mintel. The U.S. SBG category is one of the largest categories within the broader U.S. Total Snack category, with estimated retail sales of $6.8 billion in 2019 according to the Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52-weeks ended December 28, 2019. The SBG category includes breakfast items (e.g., donuts, breakfast danishes, and muffins) and all-day snacking items (e.g., snack cakes, pies, bars, brownies, blondies, and cookies). With a January 2019 Mintel study showing that flavor is the most important snacking attribute to consumers and the number one reason for snacking is to “satisfy a craving or treat myself”, our product portfolio is well positioned to benefit from these broader snacking trends.
During 2019, point of sale for our combined brands grew 77.6 million representing 60.3% of total SBG category growth. Our combined brands represented 18.8% share of the SBG category during 2019, which represents an opportunity for continued growth in comparison to 22.8% share prior to the Hostess® brands hiatus from 2012 to 2013.
Competitive landscape
Hostess® is the #2 brand in the U.S. SBG category. The top three brands, Hostess, Little Debbie, and Entenmann's account for 62% of the SBG retail sales according to Nielsen, while the rest of the category remains fairly fragmented. With limited private label penetration in the category, consumers have shown a strong preference for trusted brands within the SBG category. The leading positions are solidified through extensive product portfolios, strong brand awareness, established distribution capabilities and long-standing relationships with critical high-volume retailers. Furthermore, high levels of capital investment are required to establish manufacturing and distribution capabilities of meaningful scale, providing additional barriers to entry.
We face competition from other brands, large national bakeries, smaller regional operators and supermarket chains with their own private label brands. The key competitive factors in the industry include product quality, price, customer service, brand recognition and loyalty, promotional activities, access to retail outlets, sufficient shelf-space and ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Some of our largest national competitors include Flowers Foods, Inc., Grupo Bimbo, S.A. and McKee Foods Corporation. In addition, we also compete with regional sweet goods branded manufacturers and other companies that produce cookies, candies and other sweet snacks. At times, we experience pricing pressure in certain of our markets from competitor promotions and other pricing practices. However, we believe our brand recognition, product quality and innovation have generated consumer loyalty to many of our products which helps mitigate this impact.
Seasonality
Sweet baked goods revenues tend to be moderately seasonal, with declines during the early winter period, which we believe are attributable to altered consumption patterns during the holiday season. We expect this trend to continue to be applicable to our business. We strive to mitigate the seasonality by running certain targeted promotional campaigns.
Production
We have a lean, agile and scalable model that delivers quality results. We produce our products at five bakeries located in Emporia, Kansas; Columbus, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Chicago, Illinois; and our newly acquired bakery in Canada. Our state of the art auto-bake technologies have resulted in significant energy, labor and time savings. The technology provides fully-automated industrial baking ovens and systems, combining cost efficient, compact and continuous baking solutions that can be custom configured. We have also invested in equipment that fully-automates the packaging process (from wrapping to palletizing). A portion of our products are manufactured and packaged by third parties under our brands and distributed through our facilities.
Raw Materials
Our principal raw materials are flour, sweeteners, edible oils and compound coating, as well as corrugate and films used to package our products. We utilize various buying strategies to lock in prices for certain raw materials and packaging to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. In addition, we are dependent on natural gas as fuel for firing our ovens. Our third-party common carriers use gasoline and diesel as fuel for their trucks.
We have strategic, long-term relationships with our key suppliers for our raw materials and packaging that help leverage our buying power. While the cost of some raw materials has, and may continue to increase or decrease over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an adequate supply of raw materials as needed. We also sole source certain raw materials. We have multiple vendors that meet our supply requirements for the sole sourced materials, except in the case of certain enzymes used in our ESL technology. With respect to the enzymes, we continue to evaluate other sources in order to maintain business continuity and flexibility.
Customers
Our top 10 customers in 2019 accounted for 62.3% of total net revenue. During 2019, our largest customer, Wal-Mart and related entities, represented 23.6% of our net revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of 2019 net revenue. The loss of, or a material negative change in, our relationship with Wal-Mart or any of our other top 10 customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers and distributors, convenience, drug and dollar stores.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered Hostess®, Dolly Madison®, Cloverhill®, and Big Texas® and Voortman® brand trademarks and our sub-brand trademarks, including Twinkies®, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Zingers®, Sno Balls®, and Donettes®, are valuable assets that we believe reinforce our consumers’ favorable perception of our products. This value provides us the opportunity to sell our products at premium price points and pursue licensing opportunities.
From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. We rely on laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Research and Development
The majority of our research and development spend is dedicated to enhancing and expanding our product lines, responding to changing consumer preferences and trends and continuing to enhance the taste of our products. In addition, our research and development organization provides technical support to ensure that our core products are consistently produced in accordance with our high standards of quality and specifications. Finally, this department is charged with developing processes to reduce our costs without adversely affecting the quality of our products.
Government Regulation
Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products, are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). Our products are subject to various local, state, and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating registrations and licensing, health and sanitation standards, current Good Manufacturing Practices and traceability, hazard analysis and risk-based preventative controls, food labeling, equal employment, wage and hour requirements, and environmental protection, among others. We take compliance and the safety of our products seriously and take all steps that we consider necessary or appropriate to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
