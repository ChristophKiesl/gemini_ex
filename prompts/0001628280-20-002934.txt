Item 1. Business
Business
Community Bank of the Chesapeake (the “Bank”) is headquartered in Southern Maryland with 12 branches located in Maryland and Virginia. The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Community Financial Corporation (the “Company”). The Company provides a variety of financial services to individuals and businesses through its offices in Southern Maryland and Fredericksburg, Virginia. Its primary deposit products are demand, savings and time deposits, and its primary lending products are commercial and residential mortgage loans, commercial loans, construction and land development loans, home equity and second mortgages and commercial equipment loans.
The Company is a bank holding company organized in 1989 under the laws of the State of Maryland. It owns all the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Bank, a Maryland-chartered commercial bank. The Bank was organized in 1950 as Tri-County Building and Loan Association of Waldorf, a mutual savings and loan association, and in 1986 converted to a federal stock savings bank and adopted the name Tri-County Federal Savings Bank. In 1997, the Bank converted to a Maryland-chartered commercial bank and adopted the name Community Bank of Tri-County. Effective October 18, 2013, Community Bank changed its name to become Community Bank of the Chesapeake. The Company engages in no significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank and operating the business of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this 10-K, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiaries.
The Company’s income is primarily earned from interest received on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits. One of the key measures of our success is our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, which is called our net interest spread. In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other charges to our clients.
Our customer focus is to serve small and medium sized commercial businesses with revenues between $5.0 million and $35.0 million as well as local municipal agencies and not-for-profits. Relationship teams provide customers with specific banker contacts and a support team to address product and service demands. The Bank believes that its ability to offer fast, flexible, local decision-making will continue to attract significant new business relationships. Our structure provides a consistent and superior level of professional service and excelling at customer service is a critical part of our culture. The Bank’s marketing is directed towards increasing its balances of transactional deposit accounts. The Bank believes that increases in these account types will lessen the Bank’s dependence on higher-cost funding, such as certificates of deposit and borrowings. 
We also serve our customers through our website: www.cbtc.com. In addition to providing our customers with 24-hour access to their accounts, and information regarding our products and services, hours of service, and locations, the website provides information about the Company for the investment community. In addition, our filings with the SEC (including our annual report on Form 10-K; our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; and our current reports on Form 8-K), and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available without charge, and are posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. The website also provides information regarding our Board of Directors and management team, as well as Board Committee charters and our corporate governance policies. The content of our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
The Bank is engaged in the commercial and retail banking business as authorized by the banking statutes of the States of Maryland and Virginia and applicable federal regulations, including the acceptance of deposits, and the origination of loans. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Bank’s primary federal regulator.
Market Area
The Bank considers its principal lending and deposit market area to consist of the tri-county area in Southern Maryland and the greater Fredericksburg area in Virginia. As a result of the Bank’s expansion into the greater Fredericksburg market in 2013, Stafford and Spotsylvania Counties have become part of the Bank’s principal lending and deposit market area. Our market area is one of the fastest growing regions in the country and is home to a mix of federal facilities and industrial and high-tech businesses. The Bank’s primary market areas boast a strong median household income, low unemployment and projected population growth better 
1

than national averages. Based on information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment rates in the Company’s footprint have historically remained well below the national average.
The presence of several major federal facilities located within the Bank’s footprint and in adjoining counties contribute to economic activity. Major federal facilities include the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in St. Mary’s County, the Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center in Charles County and the Naval Surface Warfare –Naval Support Facility in King George County. In addition, there are several major federal facilities located in adjoining markets including Andrews Air Force Base and Defense Intelligence Agency & Defense Intelligence Analysis Center in Prince Georges County, Maryland and the U.S. Marine Base Quantico, Drug Enforcement Administration Quantico facility and Federal Bureau of Investigation Quantico facility in Prince William County, Virginia. These facilities directly employ thousands of local employees and serve as an important contributor to the region’s overall economic health. The economic health of the region, while stabilized by the influence of the federal government, is not solely dependent on this sector. 
The Bank expanded into the greater Fredericksburg, Virginia market in August 2013. According to the Fredericksburg Regional Alliance, Fredericksburg is the fastest growing market in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Competition
The Bank faces strong competition for deposits and loans primarily from other banks and federal and state credit unions located in its market area. There are more than 20 FDIC-insured depository institutions as well as several large credit unions operating in the Bank’s footprint including several large regional and national bank holding companies. The Bank also faces significant competition for deposits from mutual funds, brokerage firms, online Banks, and other financial service companies. The Bank competes for loans by providing competitive rates, flexible terms and personal service, including customer access to senior decision makers. It competes for deposits by offering depositors a variety of account types, convenient office locations and competitive rates. Other services offered include tax deferred retirement programs, brokerage services through an affiliation with Community Wealth Advisors, cash management services and safe deposit boxes. The Bank has used targeted direct mail, print and online advertising and community outreach to increase its market share of deposits, loans and other services in its market area. It provides ongoing training for its staff to provide high-quality service.
Economy
Economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most financial institutions, including the Bank. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in our market areas.
The economy continued to grow in 2019 with annual GDP growth of 2.3%, led by consumer spending. Residential home spending and refinancing activity began to improve in the second half of 2019, as interest rates were cut multiple times by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ("FOMC"). Business investment declined in 2019 and could be an important economic indicator of an economic slowdown if it declines further in 2020. The fears of a negative impact on GDP from trade wars were sidelined in late 2019 and early 2020 with progress on a US-China trade deal and the passing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The continued progress with US-China trade relationship could have an impact on the 2020 economy. The United States reached its longest expansion in US history during the third quarter of 2019. Despite the length of the current recovery, many economists do not see a looming recession in 2020 but are cautious to predict continued economic expansion about 2021 and beyond. 
In 2019, the Mid-Atlantic region in which the Company operates continued to experience solid regional economic performance. In the Bank’s footprint residential housing demand was stable during 2019 with home prices up between 1.0% to 4.0% in the Bank's footprint. 
The presence of federal government agencies, as well as significant government facilities, and the related private sector support for these entities, has led to faster economic growth in our market and lower unemployment compared to the nation as a whole. These facilities directly employ thousands of local employees and serve as an important player in the region’s overall economic health. In addition, the Bank’s proximity to Washington DC, Annapolis, Northern Virginia and Prince George County has provided the Bank with additional loan and deposit opportunities. These opportunities have positively impacted the Bank’s organic growth. 
The impact of government shutdowns or sequestration is more acutely felt in the Bank’s footprint. In addition to the temporary economic impact to government employees, the Bank’s business customers, which include government contractors that directly 
2

support the federal government and small businesses that indirectly support the government and its employees, can be impacted with permanent losses of revenue. A prolonged shutdown or a lack of confidence in the federal government’s ability to fund its operations could have an impact to spending and investments in the Company’s footprint. The economic health of the region, while stabilized by the influence of the federal government, is not solely dependent on this sector. Unemployment rates and household income in the Company’s footprint have historically performed better than the national averages.
The FOMC rate cuts in 2019 helped limit the Company’s net interest margin compression compared to peer institutions as the Bank's slight liability-sensitivity caused interest-bearing liabilities to reprice only slightly slower than interest-earning assets. 
Lending Activities
General
The Bank offers a wide variety of real estate and commercial loans. The Bank’s lending activities include commercial real estate loans, loans secured by residential rental property, construction loans, land acquisition and development loans, equipment financing, commercial and consumer loans. Most of the Bank’s customers are residents of or businesses located in the Bank’s market area. The Bank’s primary targets for commercial loans consist of small and medium-sized businesses with revenues of $5.0 million to $35.0 million as well as not-for-profits in Southern Maryland, the Annapolis and Prince George's County areas of Maryland and the greater Fredericksburg area of Virginia. For a description of the risk characteristics of the Bank's loan portfolio segments refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and Other Non-Residential Real Estate Loans
The permanent financing of commercial and other improved real estate projects, including office buildings, retail locations, churches, and other special purpose buildings, is the largest component of the Bank’s loan portfolio. The CRE portfolio includes commercial construction that converts after the completion of construction to permanent financing. 
Commercial real estate loans are secured by real property and the leases or businesses that produce income for the real property. The Bank generally limits its exposure to a single borrower to 15% of the Bank’s capital and participates with other lenders on larger projects. Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally limited to 80% of the lower of the appraised value or sales price and have an initial contractual loan amortization period ranging from three to 20 years. Interest rates and payments on these loans typically adjust after an initial fixed-rate period, which is generally between three and ten years. Interest rates and payments on adjustable-rate loans are adjusted to a rate based on the United States Treasury Bill Index, LIBOR or other indices. The great majority of the Bank’s commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate located in the Bank’s primary market area.
Payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent on the successful operation of the business or management of the properties. Repayment of such loans may be subject to conditions in the real estate market or the economy. As a result of the greater emphasis that the Bank places on increasing its portfolio of commercial real estate loans, the Bank is increasingly exposed to the risks posed by this type of lending. To monitor cash flows on income properties, the Bank requires borrowers and loan guarantors to provide annual financial statements on commercial real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, the Bank considers the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property, as well as the borrower’s global cash flows. If a determination is made that there is a potential environmental hazard, the Bank will complete an Environmental Assessment Checklist. If this checklist or the appraisal indicates potential issues, a Phase 1 environmental survey will generally be required.
Residential First Mortgage Loans
Residential first mortgage loans are generally long-term loans, amortized on a monthly or bi-weekly basis, with principal and interest due each payment. These loans are secured by owner-occupied single-family homes. The initial contractual loan payment period for residential loans typically ranges from 10 to 30 years. Residential real estate loans typically remain outstanding for significantly shorter time periods than their contractual terms. Borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their option, without penalty.
The Bank stopped originating owner-occupied residential first mortgages in 2015 and established third-party sources to originate its residential whole-loan portfolio. It has been the Bank’s practice to buy residential first mortgages from other financial institutions. The third-party sources allow the Company to maintain a well-diversified residential portfolio while addressing the credit needs of the communities in its footprint. The Bank’s practice has been to purchase individual residential first mortgage loans as well as the right to service the loans acquired. The Bank generally retains the right to service loans sold for a payment based upon a percentage (generally 0.25% of the outstanding loan balance).
3

Residential first mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% generally carry private mortgage insurance to lower the Bank’s exposure to approximately 80% of the value of the property. The Bank had fewer than 10 loans with private mortgage insurance at December 31, 2019 and 2018. All improved real estate that serves as security for a loan made by the Bank must be insured. Insurance must be maintained through the entire term of the loan and in an amount not less than that amount necessary to pay the Bank’s indebtedness.
Longer-term fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans are subject to greater interest-rate risk due to term and annual and lifetime limitations on interest rate adjustments. Adjustable mortgages are generally adjustable on one-, three-, five-, and seven-year terms with limitations on upward adjustments per re-pricing period and an upward cap over the life of the loan. There are also credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of repricing of adjustable-rate mortgage loans. During periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable-rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest cost to the borrower. 
Residential Rentals
Residential rental mortgage loans are amortizing, with principal and interest due each month. These loans are non-owner occupied and secured by income-producing 1-4 family units and apartments. The Bank originates both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential rental first mortgages. Loans secured by residential rental properties are generally limited to 80% of the lower of the appraised value or sales price at origination and have initial contractual loan payments period ranging from three to 20 years. The primary securities on a residential rental loan are the property and the leases that produce income.
Loans secured by residential rental properties involve greater risks than 1-4 family residential mortgage loans. Although, there are similar risk characteristics shared with commercial real estate loans, the balances for the loans secured by residential rental properties are generally smaller. Because payments on loans secured by residential rental properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the rental real estate market or the economy than similar owner-occupied properties.
Construction and Land Development Loans
The Bank offers loans to home builders for the construction of one- to four-family dwellings. Generally, these loans are secured by the real estate under construction as well as by guarantees of the principals involved. Draws are made upon satisfactory completion of predefined stages of construction. The Bank will typically lend up to 80% of the lower of appraised value or the contract purchase price of the homes to be constructed. In addition, the Bank offers loans to acquire and develop land, as well as loans on undeveloped, subdivided lots for home building by individuals. Bank policy requires that zoning and permits must be in place prior to making development loans. The Bank typically lends up to the lower of 75% of the appraised value or cost. The Bank’s ability to originate residential construction and development loans is heavily dependent on the continued demand for single-family housing in the Bank’s market area. 
The Bank’s investment in these loans has declined in recent years. Construction and land development loans as a percentage of the Bank’s portfolio have been decreasing since the 2008 financial crisis. If the demand for new houses being built from smaller builders in the Bank’s market areas continues to decline, this portion of the loan portfolio may continue to decline. In addition, a decline in demand for new housing might adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay these loans.
Construction and land development loans are inherently riskier than financing owner-occupied real estate. The Bank’s risk of loss is affected by the accuracy of the initial estimate of the market value of the completed project as well as the accuracy of the cost estimates made to complete the project. In addition, the volatility of the real estate market has made it increasingly difficult to ensure that the valuation of land associated with these loans is accurate. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, a project’s value might be insufficient to assure full repayment. Construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the Bank forecloses on a project, there can be no assurance that the Bank will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.

Home Equity and Second Mortgage Loans
The Bank has a portfolio of home equity and second mortgage loans. Home equity loans are generally lines of credit and have terms of up to 20 years, variable rates priced at the then current Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin, and require an 80% or 90% loan-to-value ratio (including any prior liens), depending on the specific loan program. Second mortgage loans are fixed or variable-rate loans that have original terms between five and 15 years. These products contain a higher risk of default than residential first mortgages as in the event of foreclosure, the first mortgage must be paid off prior to collection of the second mortgage. 
Commercial Loans
The Bank offers its business customers a variety of commercial loan products including term loans, demand loans, and lines of credit. Loans are generally made for terms of five years or less. The Bank offers both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans under these product lines. When making commercial business loans, the Bank considers the financial condition of the borrower, the borrower’s payment history, the projected cash flows of the business, the viability of the industry in which the borrower operates, the value of the collateral, and the borrower’s ability to service the debt from income. These loans are primarily secured by equipment, real property, accounts receivable or other collateral. The availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend on the success of the business itself. In the case of business failure, collateral would need to be liquidated to provide repayment for the loan. In many cases, the highly specialized nature of collateral would make full recovery from the sale of collateral unlikely. 
Consumer Loans
The Bank makes a variety of consumer loans including vehicle loans, home improvement loans, and lines of credit. Loans may be secured or unsecured. Consumer loans entail greater risk from other loan types due to being secured by rapidly depreciating assets or the reliance on the borrower’s continuing financial stability.
Commercial Equipment Loans
The Bank has an amortizing commercial loan portfolio consisting of commercial equipment loans. These loans consist primarily of fixed-rate, short-term loans collateralized by a commercial customer’s equipment or secured by real property, accounts receivable, or other collateral. When making commercial equipment loans, the Bank considers the same factors it considers when underwriting a commercial business loan. Commercial loans are of higher risk than commercial real estate loans. The availability of funds for the repayment of commercial equipment loans may depend on the success of the business itself. In the case of business failure, collateral would need to be liquidated to provide repayment for the loan. In many cases, the highly specialized nature of collateral equipment would make full recovery from the sale of collateral problematic.
Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales
The Bank solicits loan applications through marketing by commercial loan officers, its branch network, and referrals from customers. Loans are processed and approved according to Bank guidelines. Additionally, residential mortgages are purchased from third-party providers after reviewing loan documents, underwriting support, and completing other procedures, as necessary. 
Loan processing functions are generally centralized except for small consumer loans. Depending on market conditions, residential mortgage loans may be classified with the intent to sell to third parties. The Company sold no residential mortgage loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. 
To comply with internal and regulatory limits on loans to one borrower, the Bank may sell portions of commercial, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans to other lenders. The Bank may also buy loans or portions of loans from other lenders to limit overall exposure. The Bank only purchases loans or portions of loans after reviewing loan documents, underwriting support, and completing other procedures, as necessary. Purchased participation loans are subject to the same regulatory and internal policy requirements as other loans in the Bank’s portfolio as described below.
Loan Approvals, Procedures and Authority
Loan approval authority is established by Board policy. The Credit Risk Committee (“CRC”) of the Board, consisting of three or more directors, assists the Board in its oversight responsibilities. The Committee reviews the Bank’s credit risk management, including the significant policies, procedures and practices employed to manage credit risk, and provides recommendations to the Board and strategic guidance to management on the assumption, management and mitigation of credit risk.
5

All loans and loan relationships that exceed the Bank’s in-house lending limit are required to be approved by at least three (3) members of the Bank’s CRC. In addition, the Board of Directors or the CRC approve all loans required to be approved by regulation, such as Regulation O loans or commercial loans to employees. The in-house lending guideline is approved by the Board on an annual basis or as needed if more frequently and is less than the Bank’s legal lending limit.
The Officer’s Loan Committee (OLC) consists of the following members of the Bank’s executive management; the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), President, Business Officers of the Virginia and Maryland markets and the Senior Credit Officer ("SCO"). The OLC must have three (3) aforementioned members of Executive Management approve all loans that meet the OLC threshold. Loans that fall below the OLC threshold are approved by the appropriate level of line and credit (dual approved authority). 
Loans to One Borrower
Under Maryland law, the maximum amount that the Bank is permitted to lend to any one borrower and his or her related interests may generally not exceed 10% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus, which is defined to include the Bank’s capital, surplus, retained earnings and 100% of its reserve for possible loan losses. Under this authority, the Bank would have been permitted to lend up to $19.4 million to any one borrower at December 31, 2019. By interpretive ruling of the Maryland Commissioner, Maryland banks have the option of lending up to the amount that would be permissible for a national bank, which is generally 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (defined to include a bank’s total capital for regulatory capital purposes plus any loan loss allowances not included in regulatory capital). Under this formula, the Bank would have been permitted to lend up to $30.0 million to any one borrower at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, the largest amount outstanding and committed to any one borrower and borrower’s related interests was $27.0 million.
Loan Commitments
The Bank does not normally negotiate standby commitments for the construction and purchase of real estate. It has been the Bank’s experience that few commitments expire unfunded.  Refer to Note 18 "Commitments and Contingencies" in the consolidated financial statements for more information.
Maturity of Loan Portfolio
See Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") for information regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the Bank’s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity as of December 31, 2019. 
Asset Classification
Federal regulations require use of an internal asset classification system to report on asset quality. We use an internal asset classification system, substantially consistent with Federal banking regulations, as a part of our credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a classification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of these categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated “special mention.”
When an insured institution classifies assets as “substandard” or “doubtful,” it is required that a specific valuation allowance for loan losses be established in an amount deemed prudent by management. When an insured institution classifies assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. For additional information regarding the Company's credit quality indicators and risk grading scale refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion in the MD&A.
Delinquencies
The Bank’s collection procedures provide that when a loan is 15 days delinquent, the borrower is contacted, and payment is requested. If the delinquency continues, efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower and obtain payment. If these efforts prove unsuccessful, the Bank will pursue appropriate legal action including repossession of the collateral. In certain instances, the Bank will attempt to modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize 
6

borrower’s financial affairs. For an analysis of past due loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, refer to Note 3 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impaired Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Bank individually evaluates substandard classified loans to determine whether a loan is impaired. Classified doubtful and loss loans, loans delinquent 90 days or greater, non-accrual loans and troubled debt restructures (“TDRs”) are generally considered impaired. For additional information regarding the Company's impairment methodology as well as the allowance for loans losses refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion in the MD&A under Critical Accounting Policies and Asset Quality.
Non-performing Assets
The Bank’s non-performing assets include other real estate owned, non-accrual loans and TDRs. Both non-accrual and TDR loans include loans that are paid current and are performing in accordance with the term of their original or modified contract terms. For a detailed discussion on asset quality see the MD&A. 
Investment Activities
The Bank maintains a portfolio of investment securities to provide liquidity as well as a source of earnings. The Bank’s investment securities portfolio consists primarily of asset-backed mortgage-backed (“MBS”) and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) and other securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), including FNMA and FHLMC. The Bank also has smaller holdings of privately issued mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury obligations, municipal bonds and other equity and debt securities. The Bank is required to maintain investments in the Federal Home Loan Bank based upon levels of borrowings.
The Bank’s investment policy provides that securities that will be held for indefinite periods of time, including securities that will be used as part of the Bank’s asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayments and similar factors are classified as AFS and accounted for at fair value. In December 2019, the Company reclassified the HTM investment portfolio to the AFS investment portfolio. The Bank's primary reasons for the reclassification were to better manage interest rate risks and provide additional on-balance sheet liquidity. Management believes that the reclassification and active oversight of the investment portfolio allows the Bank to take appropriate actions to defend interest-rate sensitivity in both rates up or down environments, and over time should lead to improved earnings of the Bank in a safe and sound manner. Management determined that it no longer had the positive intent to hold its investment in securities classified as HTM until maturity and does not intend to hold HTM securities in the future. The Company's HTM portfolio was primarily asset-backed securities issued by GSEs and U.S. Agencies. There were no HTM investments securities at December 31, 2019. Certain of the Company’s asset-backed securities are issued by private issuers (defined as an issuer that is not a government or a government-sponsored entity). The Company had no investments in any private issuer’s securities that aggregate to more than 10% of the Company’s equity. For a discussion of investments see the MD&A and Notes 1 and 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deposits and Other Sources of Funds
General
The funds needed by the Bank to make loans are primarily generated by deposit accounts solicited from its market area. The Company uses brokered deposits and borrowings to supplement funding when loan growth exceeds core deposit growth and for asset-liability management purposes. Reciprocal deposits are used to maximize FDIC insurance available to our customers. During 2018, revisions to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act determined that reciprocal deposits are core deposits and are not considered brokered deposits unless they exceed 20% of a bank’s liabilities or $5.0 billion.
Deposits
The Bank’s deposit products include savings, money market, demand deposit, IRA, SEP, and time deposit accounts. Variations in service charges, terms and interest rates are used to target specific markets. Products and services for deposit customers include safe deposit boxes, night depositories, cash vaults, automated clearinghouse transactions, wire transfers, ATMs, online and telephone banking, retail and business mobile banking, remote deposit capture, FDIC insured reciprocal deposits, merchant card services, credit monitoring, investment services, positive pay, payroll services, account reconciliation, bill pay, credit cards and lockbox. The Bank is a member of ACCEL, Master Card, Cirrus, Allpoint and Star ATM networks as well as the Bazing online membership discount program. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank operated 15 automated teller machines which includes three stand-alone locations. 
The FDIC’s examination policies require that the Company monitor all customer deposit concentrations at or above 2% of total deposits. For a discussion of deposits, see the MD&A and Notes 1 and 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Borrowings
Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Bank’s lending and investment activities and for its general business purposes. The Bank uses advances from the FHLB of Atlanta to supplement the supply of funds it may lend and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the FHLB are secured by the Bank’s stock in the FHLB, a portion of the Bank’s loan portfolio and certain investments. Generally, the Bank’s ability to borrow from the FHLB of Atlanta is limited by its available collateral and also by an overall limitation of 30% of assets. Further, short-term credit facilities are available at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and commercial banks. Long-term debt consists of adjustable-rate advances with rates based upon LIBOR, fixed-rate advances, and convertible advances. For a discussion of borrowing, see the MD&A and Notes 1, 8, 9 and 10 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Subsidiary Activities
The Company has two direct subsidiaries other than the Bank. In July 2004, Tri-County Capital Trust I was established as a statutory trust under Delaware law as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to issue trust preferred securities. Tri-County Capital Trust I issued $7.0 million of trust preferred securities on July 22, 2004. In June 2005, Tri-County Capital Trust II was also established as a statutory trust under Delaware law as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to issue trust preferred securities. Tri-County Capital Trust II issued $5.0 million of trust preferred securities on June 15, 2005. For more information regarding these entities, see Note 9 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Bank has one direct subsidiary, Community Mortgage Corporation of Tri-County, that is currently inactive. This corporation was formed in April 1997 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank to offer mortgage banking, brokerage, and other services to the public. 
Employees
The Bank has 194 full time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2019. Bank employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that relations with our employees are good. The Company has no employees and reimburses the Bank for estimated expenses, including an allocation of salaries and benefits.

Supervision and Regulation
Regulation of the Company
General
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders, and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 
The following discussion summarizes certain of the regulations applicable to the Company but does not purport to be a complete description of such regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations involved.
Acquisition of Control
A bank holding company, with certain exceptions, must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before (1) acquiring ownership or control of another bank or bank holding company if it would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank or bank holding company (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging with another bank holding company. In evaluating such application, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial condition and managerial resources of the companies involved, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and competitive factors. Federal law provides that no person may acquire “control” of a bank holding company or insured bank without the approval of the appropriate federal regulator. Control is defined to mean direct or indirect ownership, control of 25% or more of any class of voting stock, control of the election of a majority of the bank’s directors or a determination by the Federal Reserve Board that the acquirer has or would have the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution.
The Maryland Financial Institutions Code additionally prohibits any person from acquiring more than 10% of the outstanding shares of any class of securities of a bank or bank holding company or electing a majority of the directors or directing the management or policies of any such entity, without the prior approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may deny approval of the acquisition if the Commissioner determines it to be anti-competitive or to threaten the safety or soundness of a banking institution.
Permissible Activities
A bank holding company is limited in its activities to banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Other permitted non-bank activities have been identified as closely related to banking. Bank holding companies that are “well capitalized” and “well managed” and whose financial institution subsidiaries have satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act records can elect to become “financial holding companies,” which are permitted to engage in a broader range of financial activities than are permitted to bank holding companies. The Company has not opted to become a financial holding company.
The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity, or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company.
Dividend
The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a prospective rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.” See “Regulation of the Bank – Capital Adequacy.”

Sources of Strength
The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine requiring bank holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository subsidiaries, by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
Stock Repurchases
The Company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption. This requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that are “well capitalized,” “well-managed” and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
Capital Requirement
Bank holding companies are required to maintain on a consolidated basis, specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements, which generally apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 billion or more, such as the Company, are substantially similar to those applicable to the Bank. See “– Regulation of the Bank – Capital Adequacy.” The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to adopt consolidated capital requirements for holding companies that are equally as stringent as those applicable to the depository institution subsidiaries. That means that certain instruments that had previously been includable in Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies, such as trust preferred securities, will no longer be eligible for inclusion. The revised capital requirements are subject to certain grandfathering and transition rules. The Company is currently considered a grandfathered institution under these rules.
Regulation of the Bank
General
The Bank is a Maryland commercial bank and its deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Bank currently is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the State of Maryland (the “Commissioner”) and the FDIC.
The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB assumed responsibility for implementing federal consumer financial protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function formerly handled by federal bank regulatory agencies. However, institutions of less than $10 billion, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection or fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to enforcement authority of their primary federal regulators.
The following discussion summarizes regulations applicable to the Bank but does not purport to be a complete description of such regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations involved.
Capital Adequacy
On July 9, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Capital Rules”).
On January 1, 2015, the Company and Bank became subject to the Basel III Capital Rules with full compliance with all of the final rules’ requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions compared to the previous U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive approach. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules.
The Basel III Capital Rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, require a minimum ratio (“Min. Ratio”) of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A new capital conservation buffer (“CCB”) is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer began being phased-in January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its 
10

final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the final rules. The final rules also revise the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, total capital, and risk-weighted assets.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action
Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For such purposes, the law establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
As a result of the Basel III Capital Rules (discussed further above), effective January 1, 2015, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution is deemed to be “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater and generally a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater. An institution is deemed to be “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5% or generally a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. An institution is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.
“Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. An institution’s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the bank’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, a regulatory order requiring them to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized; requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers; and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company.
Beginning 60 days after becoming “critically undercapitalized,” critically undercapitalized institutions also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver is required for a critically undercapitalized institution within 270 days after it obtains such status.
Branching
Maryland law provides that, with the approval of the Commissioner, Maryland banks may establish branches within Maryland and may establish branches in other states by any means permitted by the laws of such state or by federal law. The FDIC may approve interstate branching by merger in any state that did not opt out and de novo in states that specifically allow for such branching.
Dividend Limitations
Maryland banks may only pay cash dividends from undivided profits or, with the prior approval of the Commissioner, their surplus in excess of 100% of required capital stock. Maryland banks may not declare a stock dividend unless their surplus, after the increase in capital stock, is equal to at least 20% of the outstanding capital stock as increased. If the surplus of the bank, after the increase in capital stock, is less than 100% of its capital stock as increased, the commercial bank must annually transfer to surplus at least 10% of its net earnings until the surplus is 100% of its capital stock as increased.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts
The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The deposit insurance per account owner is currently $250,000.
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. The initial base assessment rate ranges from three to 30 basis points. The rate schedules will automatically adjust in the future when the Deposit 
11

Insurance Fund reaches certain milestones. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its prudential banking regulator. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
Pursuant to the FDIC’s examination policies, the Bank is required to actively monitor large deposit relationships and concentration risks. This includes monitoring deposit concentrations and maintaining fund management policies and strategies that take into account potentially volatile concentrations and significant deposits that mature simultaneously. The FDIC defines a large depositor as a customer or entity that owns or controls 2% or more of the Bank’s total deposits. Examiners are charged with considering the overall relationship between customers and the institution when assessing the volatility of large deposits, and key considerations include potential cash flow fluctuations, pledging requirements, affiliated relationships, and the narrow interest spreads that may be associated with large deposits. 
Reserve Requirements
Under federal regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations required that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for 2019: (i) a 3% reserve ratio was assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $124.2 million; and (ii) a 10% reserve ratio was applied above $124.2 million. The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually and, for 2020, a 3% ratio for up to $127.5 million and an exemption of $16.9 million. At December 31, 2019, the Bank met applicable reserve requirements.
Transactions with Affiliates
A state nonmember bank, such as the Bank, is limited in the amount of “covered transactions” with any affiliate. Covered transactions must also be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the Bank or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar types of transactions. Certain covered transactions, such as loans to affiliates, must meet collateral requirements. At December 31, 2019, we had no transactions with affiliates.
Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of a state nonmember bank must be made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing for comparable transactions with persons who are not executive officers, directors, principal stockholders or employees of the bank. Loans to any executive officer, director and principal stockholder together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests generally may not exceed 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to such persons may not exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, in excess of the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus, or any loans cumulatively aggregating $500,000 or more, must be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the Bank with any “interested” director not participating in the voting. State nonmember banks are prohibited from paying the overdrafts of any of their executive officers or directors unless payment is made pursuant to a written, pre-authorized interest-bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or transfer of funds from another account at the Bank. In addition, loans to executive officers may not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded other borrowers and are restricted as to type, amount and terms of credit.
Enforcement
The Commissioner has extensive enforcement authority over Maryland banks. This includes the ability to issue cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and to remove directors or officers. The Commissioner may also take possession of a Maryland bank whose capital is impaired and seek to have a receiver appointed by a court.
The FDIC has primary federal enforcement responsibility over state banks under its jurisdiction, including the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-related parties,” including stockholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of capital directive or a cease and desist order for the removal of officers and/or directors, receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions and range up to $25,000 per day or even up to $1 million per day (in the most egregious cases). Criminal penalties for most financial institution crimes include fines of up to $1 million and imprisonment for up to 30 years.
