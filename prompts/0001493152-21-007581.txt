ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Name and Organization
 
Trillion Energy International Inc. (formerly Park Place Energy, Inc.) and its consolidated subsidiaries, (“Trillion Energy”, “Company”, “we” or “our”) is headquartered out of Turan Gunes with operations based primarily from Turkey at Turan Gunes Bulvari, Park Oran Ofis Plaza, 180-y, Daire:45, Kat:14, 06450, Oran, Cankaya, Ankara, Turkey. The Company also has registered offices in Canada and Bulgaria. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 2015.
General
 
Trillion Energy International Inc. is focused on it’s oil and gas assets in Turkey, where it intends to exponentially expand natural gas production on the SASB Gas Field in the offshore Black Sea through exploitation of existing reserves, to drill an oil exploration well in the Zagros basin, Turkey as well as drilling a gas exploration well on its Vranino 1-11 exploration license in Bulgaria.
Oil and Gas Operations
 
On January 18, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of three oil and gas exploration and production companies operating in Turkey (the “PPE Companies”). As a result of the acquisition of the PPE Companies, the Company now owns interests in the producing Cendere oil field, in the producing South Akcakoca Sub-Basin (“SASB”) gas field, and in the shut in Bakuk gas field. The Company has an office in Ankara with nine full time employees.
Cendere Oil Field
 
We own 19.6% interest in the onshore Cendere oil field except three wells where we own 9.8% interest. We own a 49% working interest in the offshore SASB. At December 31, 2020, the gross oil production rate for the producing wells in Cendere oil field was 1,086 bbls/day; the average daily 2020 gross production rate for the field was 737 bbls/day. Oil is currently sold at a price of approximately US$62.4 per barrel for a netback per barrel of approximately US$33/Bbl. At December 31, 2020, net production to us was 190 barrels of oil equivalent per day or Boe/d. For the year 2020, net production to us averaged 178 Boe/d.
 
The Cendere Field was first discovered in 1988. Oil production commenced during 1990. The operator of the Cendere Field is TPAO. The Company’s interest is 19.6% for all wells except for wells C-13, C-15 and C-16, for which its interest is 9.8%. The produced oil has a gravity of 27.5o API. After the initial development of the Cendere Field, oil production was approximately 2,000 bopd from three wells and which peaked at approximately 7,000 bopd in 1992, when additional wells were put into production. The field started to produce water during the first year of production. As of February 28, 2021, 20.88MMbbls of oil have been produced from the Cendere Field. During February 2021, the Company’s average net oil was 139 bopd at 96% water cut.
 
A description of the Cendere Field geological and reservoir characteristics is as follows. The reservoirs are located in the South East Anatolian Basin and within the Middle Cretaceous period. The carbonated Derdere Formation is the main reservoir in Cendere Field and has dolomitization and fracturing, which enhance its production characteristics. There are also four additional oil reservoirs contained within Cendere Field.

The Cendere Field is covered by 54 km2 of 3D seismic that was acquired in 2004.
 
The field was developed using a collection of dispersed oil wells from which production is collected and exported to the Cendere gathering station. The produced oil is exported to the TPAO Karakus processing facility which then is transported onwards to the BOTAS-operated oil pipeline.
 
There are 20 well pads which currently house 16 producing wells spread over an area of approximately 15 square kilometers. A field gathering station, located to the southwest of the Cendere Field collects the oil and produced water from a collection of flowlines and manifolds.
 
SASB Gas Fields
 
As at December 31, 2020, four wells were producing at the SASB gas fields, each of which is tied into a production platform. The SASB fields are connected through subsea pipelines to an onshore gas plant which is tied into a national pipeline. Gas is sold to a local utility on a take-or pay basis. The SASB gas fields are located in shallow water (60-100m) off the north coast of Turkey towards the western end of the Black Sea. Total gross natural gas production to date from the SASB gas fields since inception in 2007 is more than 41 BCF. The SASB Gas field has four proved undeveloped discoveries which contain an estimated proven and probable reserves of 41 BCF of natural gas set out in the Company’s December 31, 2020 year end reserve report prepared by GLJ Consultants, as discussed herein. A map of the gas field prepared by GLJ Consultants is below:
 

During the year, the Company assessed several additional low risk gas prospects on SASB directly contiguous to the proven reserves. The chance of discovery for these prospects as assessed by GLJ ranging from 60-90%. Historically, the Company has a greater than 80% success rate at SASB when drilling exploration wells based on 3D seismic interpretation. As a result, the Company intends to drill an additional 6 low risk gas pools based on these prospects to establish additional reserves and production. The Company also has numerous exploration prospects that have not yet been assessed by GLJ Consultants on the SASB block which require the existing 3D seismic to be reprocessed.

At December 31, 2020, the gross gas production rate for the three remaining producing wells in SASB was a nominal 0.70 MMcfd; the average daily 2020 gross production rate for the field was 0.945 MMcfd, which is a result of no new drillings or rig based workovers having been completed since 2011, a decrease over 95% since peak production occurred of over 11 BCF/annum (gross 100% interest) which occurred in 2011. At the end of February 2021, gas is currently sold at a price of approximately US$5.72.
 
The Company continues to produce gas from SASB as a loss to avoid shutting in the field and facilities as commencing in August 2021 the Company plans to commence a revitalization program by drilling new wells which will ramp up production and generate positive net backs and earnings. Based on the current drilling schedule, two new wells and one well workover are anticipated to occur between August and October 2021, resulting in increased production revenues towards the end of September 2021. Another three wells and one workover will occur commencing February 2022 and will be brough into production at this time. This later drilling program will be followed an by additional 10 well drilling program on the four SASB gas fields commencing in 2022. 3-D seismic will be reprocessed to delineate existing targets and to expand the drilling program, where 13 additional targets have also been identified meriting further study, which will likely result in additional reserves and resources.
 
On March 2021, the Company announced its plans to investigate around the SASB development license area which is currently 12,385 hectares by applying for a Technical Investigation Survey Permit for 200,000 hectares of surrounding area “the Permit”. Upon receiving the Permit, the Company plans to reprocess existing 3D and 2D seismic with new technology which are expected to improve the resolution of the data defining new exploration targets proximate to the Production The below map sets out the 2D seismic (light blue) covering proposed exploration area relative to the Production Block (dark blue cross hatch):
 

Bakuk gas field 
 
With the acquisition of the PPE Turkey Companies, the Company also acquired another oil and gas asset, a 50% operated interest in the Bakuk gas field located near the Syrian border. The Bakuk field is shut-in with no plans to revive production in the near term.

Derecik exploration block
 
A 42,833 Hectares oil exploration property “Derecik” is located in the South West Turkey which lies within NW extension of Zagros fold & thrust belt, which has some of the largest oil reserves in the world on IRAQI side. The Company’s plan is to drill one exploration well on the license.
 
Bulgaria License
 
In October of 2010, the Company was awarded an exploration permit for the “Vranino 1-11 Block”, a 98,205 acre oil and gas exploration land located in Dobrudja Basin, Bulgaria, by the Bulgarian Counsel of Ministers. On April 1, 2014, the Company entered into an Agreement for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prospecting and Exploration in the Vranino 1-11 Block with the Ministry of Economy and Energy of Bulgaria (the “License Agreement”). The initial term of the License Agreement is five years. This five-year period will commence once the Bulgarian regulatory authorities approve of the Company’s work programs for the permit area. The License Agreement (or applicable legislation) provides for possible extension periods for up to five additional years during the exploration phase, as well as the conversion of the License Agreement to an exploitation concession, which can last for up to 35 years. Under the License Agreement, the Company will submit a yearly work program that is subject to the approval of the Bulgarian regulatory authorities.
 
Before the license for the Bulgarian CBM project is “effective”, the Company’s overall work program and first year annual work program must be approved by both the Bulgarian environmental ministry and the energy ministry. The Company is currently working on an environmental assessment in order to finalize the exploration permit.

-


Our current or future operations, including exploration and development activities on our properties, require permits from various governmental authorities, and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which we are conducting business. These laws and regulations concern exploration, development, production, exports, taxes, labor laws and standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection and other matters. Compliance with these requirements may prove to be difficult and expensive. Due to our international operations, we are subject to the following issues and uncertainties that can affect our operations adversely:
 

● | the risk of expropriation, nationalization, war, revolution, political instability, border disputes, renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, and import, export and transportation regulations and tariffs; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | laws of foreign governments affecting our ability to fracture stimulate oil or natural gas wells, such as the legislation enacted in Bulgaria in January 2012, discussed in greater detail below; 
● | the risk of not being able to procure residency and work permits for our expatriate personnel; 
● | taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims; 
● | exchange controls, currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over international operations; 
● | laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment; 
● | the possibility of being subjected to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and 
● | the possibility of restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital from foreign countries. 

 
Permits and Licenses. In order to carry out exploration and development of oil and natural gas interests or to place these interests into commercial production, we may require certain licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required. In addition, such licenses and permits are subject to change and there can be no assurances that any application to renew any existing licenses or permits will be approved.

Repatriation of Earnings. Currently, there are no restrictions on the repatriation of earnings or capital to foreign entities from Bulgaria. In Turkey, funds which are invested in the Turkish entities and which are registered with the Turkish authorities may be repatriated without tax. There is a 10% tax on dividends on profits which are transferred out of Turkey. However, there can be no assurance that any such restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital from the aforementioned countries or any other country where we may invest will not be imposed, changed or increased in the future.
 
Environmental. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulations. Environmental regulations establish standards respecting health, safety and environmental matters and place restrictions and prohibitions on emissions of various substances produced concurrently with oil and natural gas. The regulatory requirements cover the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products and waste created by water and air pollution control procedures. These regulations may have an impact on the selection of drilling locations and facilities, potentially resulting in increased capital expenditures. In addition, environmental legislation may require those wells and production facilities to be abandoned and sites reclaimed to the satisfaction of local authorities. Such regulation has increased the cost of planning, designing, drilling, operating and, in some instances, abandoning wells. We are committed to complying with environmental and operation legislation wherever we operate.
 
There has been a recent surge in interest among the media, government regulators and private citizens concerning the possible negative environmental and geological effects of fracture stimulation. Some have alleged that fracture stimulation results in the contamination of aquifers and may even contribute to seismic activity. In January 2012, the government of Bulgaria enacted legislation that banned the fracture stimulation of oil and natural gas wells in Bulgaria and imposed large monetary penalties on companies that violate that ban. Such legislation or regulations could impact our ability to drill and complete wells, and could increase the cost of planning, designing, drilling, completing and operating wells. We are committed to complying with legislation and regulations involving fracture stimulation wherever we operate.
 
Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own negligence but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. We may incur significant costs as a result of environmental accidents, such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures, or discharges of hazardous materials into the environment, including clean-up costs and fines or penalties. Additionally, we may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations and may be forced to pay fines or penalties if we do not comply.
 
Competition
 
Bulgaria imports nearly all of their natural gas requirements; Turkey imports a substantial quantity of the same. Both countries encourage domestic production as a way to reduce imports and increase energy security. In Turkey, natural gas is imported from a number of countries so there is a vibrant market for natural gas produced in the country. In Bulgaria, currently one company, Gazprom, supplies Bulgaria with virtually all of its natural gas being marketed and consumed in Bulgaria through a pipeline that runs through Ukraine from Russia. On a regional level, we compete for license blocks and capital with other oil and gas exploration companies and independent producers who are actively seeking oil and natural gas properties throughout the world, but in particular, in Southeast Europe, Turkey and countries in the immediate vicinity.
 
The principal area of competition is encountered in the financial ability of our Company to acquire acreage positions and drill wells to explore for oil and natural gas, then, if warranted, install production equipment. Competition for the acquisition of oil and gas license areas is high in Europe. Therefore, we may or may not be successful in acquiring additional blocks in the face of this competition. Presently, we are not seeking additional license blocks.

From a general standpoint, we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and acquisition with a substantial number of other companies, including U.S.-based and international companies doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. We face intense competition from independent, technology-driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in each of the following areas:
 

● | seeking oil and natural gas exploration licenses and production licenses and leases; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration; 
● | marketing oil and natural gas production; 
● | integrating new technologies; and 
● | contracting for drilling services and equipment and securing the expertise necessary to develop and operate properties. 

 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, managerial, technological and other resources than we do. To the extent competitors are able to pay more for properties than we are paying, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. Further, many of our competitors enjoy technological advantages over us and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. Our ability to explore for and produce oil and natural gas prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations, implement advanced technologies, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.
 
Employees, Officers and Directors
 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has eight employees in Turkey, and three in North America. As of December 31, 2020, our business is generally conducted through our officers and directors of the Company. A description of officers and directors can be found in Item 10.
