      Corporate Strategy
 
Management’s corporate strategy is to continue to build and develop Inpixon as a technology company that provides turnkey solutions from the collection of data to delivering insights from that data to our customers with a focus on securing, digitizing and optimizing premises with indoor Positioning Analytics (IPA) for businesses and governments. In connection with such strategy and in order to facilitate our long-term growth, we have acquired certain companies, technologies and intellectual property, or IP, that complement such goals and will continue to consider completing additional strategic acquisitions as long as our financial condition permits. An important element of this mergers and acquisitions strategy is to acquire companies with complementary capabilities and/or innovative and commercially proven technologies in indoor positioning and big data analytics and to obtain an established customer base. We believe that acquiring complementary products and/or IP will add value to the Company, and the customer base of each potential acquisition will also present an opportunity to cross-sell our existing solutions. Candidates with proven technologies that complement our overall strategy may come from anywhere in the world, so long as there are strategic and financial reasons to make the acquisition. If we conduct any acquisitions in the future, we expect to pay for such acquisitions using restricted common stock, cash and debt financing in combinations appropriate for each acquisition. In connection with our strategic business plan, Inpixon may also consider the sale or divestment of certain assets for strategic and financial purposes should the management deem such transactions necessary or desirable in order to facilitate its overall strategy.
Industry Overview
 
We believe that more and more enterprises are realizing the importance of employing Information Technology in their operations. The technology growth story has long focused on the consumer, but as enterprises in every industry sector, including the government sector, look to technology to facilitate and transform their own operations, the opportunities for technology companies have broadened considerably.

On July 29, 2011, we acquired all of the stock of the U.S. Federal government business of the Company, which included Sysorex Federal and its subsidiary Sysorex Government, and 50.2% of the stock of the operating unit of the Company engaged in Saudi Arabian government contracts (Sysorex Arabia, LLC). 
 
On March 20, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Lilien LLC. In conjunction with the name change we announced in February 2017, Lilien was renamed Inpixon USA. Inpixon USA, based in Larkspur, California, is an information technology company that provides a Big Data analytics platform and enterprise infrastructure capabilities. Inpixon USA delivers right-fit information technology solutions in enterprise computing and storage, virtualization, business continuity, networking and IT business consulting that help organizations reach their next level of business advantage.
 
Effective August 31, 2013, we acquired 100% of the stock of Shoom. Shoom, which was merged into Inpixon USA in January 2016, provides us with Cloud based data analytics and enterprise solutions to the media, publishing and entertainment industries.
 
Effective April 18, 2014, we acquired 100% of the stock of AirPatrol Corporation. AirPatrol, which was merged into Inpixon USA in January 2016, developed indoor device locationing, monitoring and management technologies for mobile devices operating on WiFi, cellular and wideband RF networks. Through AirPatrol we acquired two product lines, ZoneDefense (now rebranded “AirPatrol for Security”) and ZoneAware (now rebranded “AirPatrol for Retail”). These products and technologies deliver solutions to address an exploding global location-based mobile security and services (LBS) and real-time location systems (RTLS) market estimated to be more than $15.0 billion in 2016 and to grow to $77.8 billion by 2021, growing at 37.5% (Source: http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/location-based-service-market-96994431.html?gclid=CKz8gKml69ICFQx6fgodTkoBNQ]. AirPatrol for Retail also serves as a location-based services, sales and marketing system. The security platform connects to third party apps on a user’s mobile device that provide functions such as location-based offers, discounts and suggestive selling, VIP service functions (for hotels, resorts, casinos, etc.), and location-based information delivery such as mobile-based guided tours of historic sites, points of interest and museums, shopping center maps, building floor plans and so on. These products require no app installation for anonymous collection of behavioral data such as traffic flow, entry and exit patterns, length of stay and other business intelligence and analytics functions.
 
On April 24, 2015, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of LightMiner Systems, Inc. (“LightMiner”), which was in the business of developing and commercializing in-memory Structured Query Language databases. The assets acquired from LightMiner included an in-memory, real-time, data analysis system designed to perform very large, highly complex and extremely difficult calculations using off-the-shelf hardware and memory. The system supports both traditional SQL-based business intelligence and analytics applications as well as a host of integrated statistical, machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms allowing it to provide supercomputer-like performance at competitive prices.
 
On November 21, 2016 we completed the acquisition of the business and certain assets of Integrio Technologies, LLC (“Integrio” or “Integrio Technologies”) and Emtech Federal, LLC (“Emtech Federal”). Integrio, together with Emtech Federal, is an IT integration and engineering company that provides solutions for network performance, secure wireless infrastructure, software application lifecycle support, and physical cyber security for federal, state and local government agencies.
 
On December 4, 2015 and effective January 1, 2016, our Board of Directors approved the following reorganization transactions: (1) statutory mergers of AirPatrol and Shoom with and into Lilien, pursuant to which Lilien was the surviving corporation and changed its name to “Sysorex USA”; and (2) a short-form statutory merger of the Company with a newly-formed wholly-owned Nevada corporation, pursuant to which the Company changed its name to “Sysorex Global”. Immediately prior to the consummation of these mergers, the Company carried out (i) an assignment from AirPatrol to the Company of all shares of capital stock of AirPatrol Research Corp. (“AirPatrol Research”), pursuant to which AirPatrol Research became a direct subsidiary of the Company; (ii) the amendment of AirPatrol Research’s Notice of Articles to change its name to “Sysorex Canada Corp.”; (iii) the dissolution and winding up of Sysorex Federal, in which Sysorex Federal assigned and transferred all of its assets, including all outstanding shares of capital stock of Sysorex Government, to the Company, and the Company assumed Sysorex Federal’s debts and liabilities; (iv) an assignment from the Company to Lilien of all outstanding shares of capital stock of Sysorex Government, pursuant to which Sysorex Government became a direct subsidiary of Lilien.

On February 27, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Inpixon, our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary formed solely for the purpose of changing our corporate name from Sysorex Global to Inpixon. As part of the name change, each of our subsidiaries also amended their corporate charters to change their names from Sysorex USA, Sysorex Government Services, Inc. and Sysorex Canada Corp. to Inpixon USA, Inpixon Federal, Inc. and Inpixon Canada, Inc., respectively, effective as of March 1, 2017. Also effective March 1, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock.

Research and Development Expenses
 
Our future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities. Our management believes that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain a competitive position. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $2.3 million and $635,000, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
 
We utilize direct marketing through approximately 44 outside and inside sales representatives, who are compensated with a base salary and some sales positions receive incentive plans such as commission or bonus plans. We utilize webinars, conferences, tradeshows and other direct and indirect marketing activities to generate demand for our products and services. We also have extensive relationships with channel partners to directly engage with customers and to perform the installation services. We train our partners and we have our own channel/partner managers to support and augment partners as needed.  
 
We have built a core competency in bidding on government requests for proposals. We utilize our internal bid and proposal team as well as consultants to prepare the proposal responses for government clients. We also use business development, sales and account management employees or consultants.
 
As part of our end-to-end IT solutions, we are authorized resellers of the products and services of leading IT manufacturers and distributors. In many cases, we have achieved the highest level of relationship the manufacturer or distributor offers. In addition, our employees hold certifications issued by these manufacturers and by industry associations relating to the configuration, installation and servicing of these products. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by the range of manufacturers and distributors we represent, the relationship level we have achieved with these manufacturers and distributors and the scope of the manufacturer and industry certifications our employees hold.
 
Inpixon has a variety of contracts that vary from cost plus to time and material in its storage and computing and professional services segments. These apply to both commercial and government customers including contracts recently acquired from Integrio Technologies. Our proprietary products such as AirPatrol and Lightminer are sold on a license or software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. In our licensing model we also typically charge an annual maintenance fee. Our Shoom product is on a monthly subscription model based on 2-3 year contracts. 
Customers
 
Inpixon has worked with over 1,000 customers company-wide since inception. These customers include many civilian and defense federal, state and local government agencies as well as enterprise customers in retail, manufacturing, life sciences, bio-tech, high-tech, agriculture, financial services, state and local government, utilities, media and entertainment, telecom and many other verticals. A partial list of recent customers include Healthnet, Gilead Sciences, Dow Jones Local Media Group, Gannett, RockStar Games, Hewlett Packard, Evault, Hawaii Electric, Hearst Corporation, E& J Gallo Winery, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, Business Wire, Premera Blue Cross and the City of Seattle. The Company does not depend on one or a few customers, however, as a result of our acquisition of Integrio, there are a few large government contracts (SEWP, CIO-CS, ADMC, GSA) that may generate a significant portion of our revenues during 2017, but these are task order contracts that come from a variety of end-user customers. In the private sector we have long term client relationships that may generate approximately 5%-10% of our revenue in a particular quarter as a result of a large project that may be in process, but once the project is completed another project may not be immediately undertaken.
Competition
 
We face substantial competition from other national, multi-regional, regional and local value-added resellers and IT service providers, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do or that may have more fully developed business relationships with clients or prospective clients than we do. Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs or accept lower selling prices than we do and, therefore, we may need to reduce our prices. In addition, manufacturers may choose to market their products directly to end-users, rather than through IT solutions providers such as us, and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We face competition from various companies, both small and large, for different parts of our business. In the Big Data analytics market, these competitors, and sometimes partners, could include HP, IBM, Splunk, Fusion Storm, Global Inc., Bear Data, LLC.

Our AirPatrol products compete with WiFi based detection companies such as Aruba, Cisco, Euclid Analytics and other smaller companies. However, these companies currently offer only WiFi detection and therefore we believe they cannot achieve the accuracy that AirPatrol can achieve. AirPatrol has partnered with or replaced some of these companies because it offers WiFi, cellular, RFID and Bluetooth and has a location accuracy of approximately 10-feet. Mobile device management companies like AirWatch, Mobile Iron and Good Technology have also integrated with AirPatrol instead of developing competing products. MerlinOne and PressTeligence compete with the functionality of our Shoom products, but typically provide information only for the specific customer and not for the customer’s competitors or for the industry.
 
The U.S. government systems integration business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a large number of systems integrators, hardware and software manufacturers, and other large and diverse companies attempting to enter or expand their presence in the U.S. government market. Many of the existing and potential competitors have greater financial, operating and technological resources than we have. The competitive environment may require us to make changes in our pricing, services or marketing. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, or that may be awarded, but for which we do not receive meaningful revenues. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products. In the government services sector our competition includes large systems integrators and defense contractors as well as small businesses such as 8a, Women Owned, Veteran Disabled, Alaskan Native, etc. Some of these competitors include global defense and IT service companies including IBM Global Services, LogicaCMG, CSC, ATOS Origins, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon IT Services and SAIC.
 
This complex landscape of domestic and multi-national services companies creates a challenging environment. To remain competitive, we must consistently provide superior service, technology and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers. While we believe that, due to the functionality of our products, we can successfully compete in all of these markets, at this time we do not represent a significant presence in any these markets.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company expects to file trademark applications for the names Inpixon, Inpixon – Indoor Positioning & Analytics, and Inpixon – Security Dome. The Company uses several trademarks relating to the products and services of AirPatrol and owns one registered mark, ZoneDefense®. The Company also owns three issued patents, two of which are registered in the United States and one of which is registered in Mexico, and has ten patent applications pending in various countries, including the United States, relating to AirPatrol products and two pending patent applications, both of which are filed in the United States, relating to Lightminer products. The awarded patents were issued September 23, 2015, September 23, 2014 and September 16, 2014 and will expire in the years 2032, 2031 and 2028, respectively.
Government Regulation
 
In general, we are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anticorruption, import/export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition.
 
Furthermore, U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, department-specific regulations that implement or supplement DFAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and other applicable laws and regulations. We are also subject to the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials; the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval; and the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts.

Violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations. To date, compliance with these regulations has not been financially burdensome.
 
Employees
 
As of March 22, 2017, we have 157 employees including 6 part-time employees. This includes 7 officers, 44 sales people, 4 marketing people, 92 technical/engineering people and 24 finance and administration persons.
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable, in general, to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include:

● | Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Reduced disclosure of financial information in this report, limited to two years of audited financial information and two years of selected financial information. 
 
As a smaller reporting company, each of the foregoing exemptions is currently available to us. We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues as of the end of a fiscal year, if we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year-period.
 
The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have chosen to “opt out” of this provision. Therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
