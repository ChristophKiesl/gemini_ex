CORPORATE HISTORY
 
Historical Business
 
Gripevine Inc. (formerly Baixo Relocation Services, Inc.,) a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on January 7, 2014 in the State of Nevada. We previously operated a consulting business whereby we provided personalized relocation services to clients, both individual and corporate, who were relocating to the state of Goa. We assisted clients who intended to relocate to the region for temporary, long-term, and permanent periods. We offered a wide range of relocation services to our clients, including arranging and assisting with transportation in the state of Goa, India, household goods movement, appropriate immigration documentation, real estate rental and purchases, children’s’ education registration, area orientation, housekeeping, utilities connections, banking introductions, local transportation, tax compliance, and language and cultural training.
 
Changes in Control of Registrant
 
Dated May 31, 2016 and effective October 3, 2016, Rosy Rodrigues (“Rodrigues”), our prior majority shareholder, sole executive officer and member of the Board of Directors, entered into those certain stock purchase agreements (collectively, the “Stock Purchase Agreements”) with certain individuals and/or entities (collectively, the “Investors”). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreements, Rodrigues sold and transferred at a per share price of $0.037 the control block of the Company consisting of 5,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and representing approximately 62.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore, there was a change in control. 
 
Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 
On December 9, 2016, the majority shareholders of the Company approved a forward stock split of fifteen for one (15:1) of our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Stock Split”) and a change in our name from "Baixo Relocation Services Inc." to "Gripevine Inc." (the "Name Change"). Pursuant to our Bylaws and the Nevada Revised Statutes, a vote by the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding votes is required to effect the Stock Split and the Name Change. Our articles of incorporation do not authorize cumulative voting. As of the record date of December 9, 2016, we had 8,000,000 voting shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The consenting stockholders of the shares of common stock are entitled to 4,300,000 votes, which represents approximately 53.75% of the voting rights associated with our shares of common stock. The consenting stockholders voted in favor of the Stock Split and the Name Change described herein in a unanimous written consent dated December 9, 2016. 
 
The Board of Directors had previously considered factors regarding their approval of the Stock Split including, but not limited to: (i) current trading price of our shares of common stock on the OTCQB Market and potential to increase the marketability and liquidity of our common stock; (ii) possible reluctance of brokerage firms and institutional investors to recommend lower-priced stocks to their clients or to hold in their own portfolios; (iii) desire to meet future requirements of per-share price and net tangible assets and shareholders’ equity relating to admission for trading on other markets; (iv) desire to mitigate short sellers and the adverse impact on the marketplace and trading of our shares; and (v) contemplation of proposed transaction with a corporate entity resulting in change of business operations. The Board of Directors of the Company approved the Name Change and the Stock Split and recommended the majority shareholders review and approve the Name Change and the Stock Split.

Amendment to Articles of Incorporation - Name Change and Forward Stock Split 
 
The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on December 22, 2016 changing the name of the Company to "Gripevine Inc." (the "Name Change"). The Name Change was effected to better reflect the future business operations of the Company. Our new trading symbol is “GRPV”. 
 
The Stock Split was effected as of January 5, 2017 based upon the filing of appropriate documentation with FINRA. The Stock Split increased our total issued and outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 8,000,000 shares to 120,000,000 shares of common stock. The common stock will continue to be $0.001 par value. 
 
The new cusip number for the Company is 39861P 100. 
 
Share Exchange Agreement
 
Effective February 28, 2017, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with MBE Holdings Inc., a private corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (“MBE”) and the shareholders of MBE (the “MBE Shareholders”). Our Board of Directors approved the execution and consummation of the transaction under the Share Exchange Agreement on February 28, 2017. The Board of Directors and the shareholders holding a majority of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MBE authorized and approved the Share Exchange Agreement. In accordance with the Delaware Business Corporation Act, “a majority of the total issued and outstanding shares is required to approve an arrangement, which is defined as "a reconstruction under which a company transfer or sell or proposes to transfer or to sell to another company the whole or a substantial part of its undertaking for a consideration consisting in whole or in part of shares of securities of the other company ..." 
 
In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement, an aggregate of 5,248,626 post-Stock Split shares of our restricted common stock are to be issued to the MBE Shareholders in exchange for 157,458,778 of the total issued and outstanding shares of MBE (constituting 100%), thus making MBE our wholly-owned subsidiary. As of the date of this Annual Report, the transfer agent has not yet issued the shares in certificate form. Our Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the respective shareholders to enter into the Share Exchange Agreement pursuant to which we would acquire all the technology and assets and assume all liabilities of MBE. This resulted in a change in overall business operations of the Company brining potential value to our shareholders. 
 
Lastly, we provided to MBE the reviewed balance sheet and statements of operation, stockholders' equity and cash flows as of and for the quarter ended November 30, 2016 (the “Financial Statements”). We had certain assets and liabilities reflected on the balance sheet of the Financial Statements as follows: (i) current assets comprised of $8 in cash; and (ii) current liabilities comprised of $4,146 primarily relating to edgar filing fees and professional fees. 
 
MBE also provided to us the reviewed balance sheet and statements of operation, stockholders’ equity and cashflows as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and had certain assets and liabilities reflected on the balance sheet as follows: (i) current assets of $33,317 consisting of $28,301 in cash and $5,016 in prepaid and other receivables; (ii) long term assets of $21,648 consisting of equipment; (iii) current liabilities of $2,473,352 consisting of $13,720 in accrued liabilities, $1,949,118 due to related parties and $510,514 due to shareholder. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement, we agreed to assume such liabilities. 
 
MBE is currently our wholly-owned subsidiary pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement.

CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS
 
General
 
Since consummation of the Share Exchange Agreement resulting in MBE being our wholly-owned subsidiary, we are involved in the ongoing development and marketing of “Gripevine”, which is a social customer experience platform for social customer service and consumer reviews. “Gripevine” includes a proprietary process to assist companies in resolving customer service complaints (the “Gripevine Proprietary Process” or “Gripevine”). The Gripevine Proprietary Process helps consumers achieve resolutions while enabling businesses to improve consumer loyalty. Our platform includes the handling of ratings, reviews, complaint resolution statuses while offering data collection features such as scoring, polling, comments, voting, and credibility points – all with the aim of creating a home for connections, resolution, business improvement, and loyalty enhancement. Consumers with legitimate customer service complaints can post it (“plant a gripe”) and connect with companies who in turn can interact with their customers on a level playing field to find an amicable resolution. 
 
Unlike other review sites that cater specifically to accumulating and displaying consumer feedback, the Gripevine business model offers significant value to both consumers and businesses. Management of the Corporation believes that the Gripevine Proprietary Process brings fairness and balance by: (i) ensuring users are real; (ii) allowing companies to reach out and verify customer identity; (iii) flagging as fake those consumers who are not identifiable; and (iv) providing companies free access to their customers. Gripevine’s unique proposition in this social customer experience space is to create consumer-company connections in order to drive loyalty through efficient and effective handling of online customer feedback and commentary.
 
Industry
 
Every day, hundreds of millions of consumers make decisions about where to spend their money at local businesses. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in the United States alone, there are over 27 million local business locations, which we believe represents a multi-trillion dollar market for commerce. We believe several secular trends will increasingly challenge the traditional ways in which local businesses have connected with consumers and will offer opportunities for solutions like ours. 
Online Reviews are Gaining Credibility. With the growth of the Internet, online reviews have become a regularly relied-upon source of information. Management believes that positive information consumers read online reinforce their decision to purchase a product or service and more and more consumers are utilizing the Internet to search for customer or user reviews. The industry witnesses’ high growth as it is understood that prospective customers consistently use review sites, and trust them, to help access quality businesses. At the same time, consumers require transparency and quick responses, which has led to the growth of social customer service management and the handling and effective response to customer commentary online. Management believes that the Gripevine Proprietary Process provides for three domains: (i) collecting and displaying customer feedback; (ii) distributing customer feedback; and (iii) providing a managed-process platform for customer relations management.
Local Advertising is Moving from Offline to Online. Over the past decade, the advertising market for local businesses has undergone rapid and fundamental changes. Consumers who at one time turned almost exclusively to the yellow pages, newspapers, magazines and other forms of offline media for information about local businesses are now increasingly relying on online resources. As consumers move online, local businesses are shifting their ad spending from traditional media sources to online advertising.

Mobile Connected Devices and Apps are Proliferating. Mobile devices provide an ideal platform for people to search for local businesses due to their ability to identify consumer location and provide all the benefits of digital content to consumers on the go. There are currently over 1 billion smartphone shipments worldwide. 
Products
 
We have invested heavily in a robust back-end social CRM system to assist in branding managed social customer experiences within a safe and private environment. Management believes that extensive market testing of the Gripevine Proprietary Process platform has resulted in significant traffic and adoption with both consumers and brands that consistently engage on both the front-end and back-end of the social CRM solutions. During our beta phase, over 100 brands (UPS, HP, Verizon, Sunwing, Greyhound, and Rogers Communications, to name a few) chose to engage with their customers on Gripevine, resulting in successful resolutions as large as involving a $250,000 life policy to simple refunds. Management believes that by having major corporations and the important SME sector resolve issues through Gripevine, including claiming their business listings and engaging with their customers, is a significant milestone in establishing the Gripevine brand. 
 
Gripevine serves the social consumer feedback community with features, such as ratings, reviews, complaint management and polling. In the social customer service space, consumers with legitimate customer service complaints can plant a gripe and connect with companies who in turn are able to interact with their customers on a level playing field through our proprietary social CRM system in order to resolve those complaints (aka gripes on Gripevine). 
 
Management believes that what makes Gripevine’s platform so unique is the ability to bring fairness and balance to the complaint resolution world of social customer service. The business model offers significant value not only to the consumer but to businesses as well by giving companies the security of an arena where they are dealing with real people with legitimate customer service issues. It also allows the respective company to communicate publically or privately depending on which approach is most helpful at that stage of communication with the consumer. 
 
Gripevine’s strategy in the online business ratings and reviews industry provides a realistic solution to an industry flooded with fake reviews, fake accounts and generally suspicious or malicious feedback. Gripevine’s motto: ‘Be Heard” underpins and addresses the solution which speaks to our differentiation strategy whereby consumers can speak publicly about their experiences and also gain trust with online commentary and reviews from a particular business’s perspective. 
 
Gripevine’s mobile application will target a greater demographic given the ever-growing percentage of people who are integrating mobile devices into their everyday lifestyle. This will allow consumers to include photos and videos, which is so important to content uptake rates and supporting the commentary on customer experiences regardless if they are positive or negative. 
 
Gripevine allows businesses to grow their customer base through their expression of responsiveness, transparency, and empathy on our platform. Educated consumers can do research on businesses allowing them to see what others experienced as well as see how businesses address customer feedback and complaints, which is so vital and important in today’s economy. 
 
Gripevine also helps consumers connect with one another on a social level. One can see common interests and concerns, answer polls, upvote and downvote and share guidance and advice among the consumer community of social customer service. Consumers can build influence and points within our gamification platform by using the site to appropriately voice opinions that will build credibility with other consumers and companies.

Process and Business Level Strategy 
 
Accounts. Companies have the opportunity to claim their Gripevine business profile page by registering for their free account. Once they have claimed their free account automated notifications of customer feedback will be initiated when a review, gripe (aka customer service issue), or comment, is planted. This occurs by following a simple verification process which will enable companies to have access to their proprietary response dashboard (the “Dashboard”) to communicate directly with consumers, either publicly or privately, with the ability to offer an immediate solution or initiate communications with the customer and acquire further information. 
 
All customer service issues are tracked with a status marker that consumers can view online. Companies can achieve positive positioning on Gripevine by purely being responsive. They will also receive feedback on the satisfaction level of the customer if a specific issue required resolution. In these ways, Gripevine provides different opportunities for companies to display and receive credit for their social customer service performance.
 
Management believes that the competitive edge and highlight of the Gripevine Proprietary Process is twofold: 
 


· | Gripevine offers companies a unique opportunity to increase the reach of their customer service capabilities (often a major challenge for SMEs) by engaging with real consumers in a safe and productive environment to reach amicable resolutions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The free Gripevine business account offers companies the best opportunity to make immediate contact, through their pre-configured dashboard, with any customer and respond to their commentary. 

 
Once companies claim their free account, access is granted to their proprietary dashboard where they can communicate publicly or privately with consumers, keep accurate track of reviews and gripes, see their current ratings, launch resolution offers, and manage their overall online customer service channels across other social platforms. 
 
We will also offer paid company accounts, which will allow companies to access a more robust social customer service management system utilizing the Gripevine unique and proprietary features allowing them to scale the use of the system to suit their organizational needs. The paid accounts will also allow the respective company to have more control over its presence on the site and be provided access to tools for gaining market share within their industries thus expanding the channels through which they will receive and manage customer service feedback. Management intends that paid accounts will offer companies access to the customer commentary and sentiment on social media. Whether a company is large or small, there is tremendous value in being able to monitor social customer service conversations about its brand across multi-platforms under one dashboard.
 
Pricing. Initially, our paid business accounts will be established at rates below-market, and provide a feature set that is relevant to each business category and size. Research in the on-line review and complaints sector, together with company Social CRM and social monitoring service provision, reveals that the combination of value-pricing and volume acquisition provides a strong business proposition.
 
Gripevine’s place in the online review and social customer experience space is founded on the premise of creating true and valuable connections between companies and consumers. This means that appropriate postings, reviews and gripes from consumers will be presented online and not manipulated and that they will be brought to the attention of the respective companies. Consumers can remain anonymous on the public site but it also means that the companies can validate that postings are from real people with real identities, and that good faith communication can be conducted on the content presented in Gripevine. This addresses a serious credibility problem for mainstream review sites: the presence of fake reviews posted by competitors, or individuals with malicious intent. Lastly, our proposition is based on building trust through transparency. Companies can reliably proceed with communications and resolutions of real commentaries. We build connections between consumers and companies resulting in potentially powerful revenue generating opportunities.

Target Markets
 
Gripevine’s platform targets a wide consumer demographic of all ages, ethnicities, income levels, education levels, and genders. Our current geographic spread indicates an early opportunity across North America, Australia, Asia, and the United Kingdom with expansion plans for multi-language capability and spreading to a fully international positioning. For businesses, we offer a tailored product appropriate to larger enterprises and an accessible feature set attractive to SMEs. We offer multiple services across a variety of platforms, whether its review and complaint resolution or Social CRM and back-office productivity. Our current industry sector positioning is not confined to the restaurant or travel sector for customer commentary. We currently have a wide band of industry sectors (such as communications, appliance manufacturers, courier companies, airlines, hotels, software companies, and retail, just to name a few) already engaged within our platform. 
Marketing Strategies
 
The primary purpose of our marketing campaigns is to increase brand awareness, foster a sense of community among local contributors, and increase the number of claimed local business locations and active local business accounts. The strength of our brand and the high quality of Gripevine reviews facilitate a powerful network effect that has helped attract a large community of users to our website with almost no traffic acquisition costs. Gripevine will utilize a unique sales channel opportunity to direct-sell to SMEs. Management believes that this sales strategy, along with reasonably priced features tailored to the SME market, is a powerful, low cost and wide reaching relationship-based sales platform. While the sales strategy saves the expense of creating a costly sales infrastructure, it also works off the power of “word of mouth” from businesses that have already successfully improved their online positioning, customer service posture and branded a social voice through the feature sets of Gripevine. We believe that this sales strategy will provide us with the opportunity to ramp up sales quickly and efficiently.
 
This strategy will allow Gripevine to: (i) ramp up sales and grow rapidly; (ii) build a large and motivated sales force at a relatively low cost; (iii) reach many businesses that would otherwise be geographically out-of-reach; and (iv) allow for better forecasting of expenses as a percentage of revenues.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Patent
 
On August 15, 2016, our President/Chief Executive Officer, filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a provisional patent, No. 62/375,027, for the “System and Method for Determining Metrics”. 
Trademarks
 
We have trademarked certain of our logos and names. On October 16, 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a trademark for “Gripevine”, Registration No. 4,227,471, for classes 35 and 42, which primarily is for business data analysis and electronic data collection and use of online non-downloadable proprietary software for business purposes for third parties featuring the use of such proprietary software to collect, evaluate and analyze consumer complaints and assist third parties in the resolution of such complaints. 
 
We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties. 
 
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of patent pending applications, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We will pursue the registration of our patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in North America and in certain locations outside the United States. We believe that our registration efforts will focus on gaining protection of our trademark “Gripevine” name and logos among others. These marks are material to our business as they enable others to easily identify us as the source of the services offered under these marks and are essential to our brand identity. 
 
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the North America or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. 
 
Companies in the Internet, media and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We are currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we may likely face claims of infringement. 
 
COMPETITION
 
Gripevine will compete for consumer traffic with traditional, offline local business guides and directories, and with other online providers of local and web search on the basis of a number of factors, including the reliability of our content, breadth, depth and timeliness of information and the strength and recognition of our brand. Gripevine will also compete for a share of local businesses’ overall advertising budgets with traditional, offline media companies and other Internet marketing providers on the basis of a number of factors, including consumer audience, effectiveness of our advertising solutions, our pricing structure and recognition of our brand. Our competitors include the following types of businesses: 
Offline. We primarily compete with offline media companies and service providers who typically have existing advertising relationships with local businesses. Services provided by competitors range from yellow pages’ listings to direct mail campaigns to advertising and listings services on local newspapers, magazines, television and radio. 

10

Online. We compete with Internet search engines, such as, Google, Yahoo! and Bing. We also compete with various other online service providers.
 
Gripevine operates on three levels: (i) local search, business ratings and reviews industry; (ii) collection and distribution of customer commentary, sentiment, and feedback to organizations; and (iii) social customer service, which includes the provision of company administration and management tools for the back-office, aimed at customer response and loyalty enhancement.
 
The main competitors in the ratings and review market are Yelp!, Angies List, Google Reviews, Trip Advisor (industry niched), and Zomato (industry niche). The players in this sector concentrate on publishing reviews to power a local search capability. Yelp, is publicly-traded on the NYSE with a large and sophisticated capital structure. Since going public they have expanded into mobile and international markets. Yelp! as an early entrant to the reviews industry has been buffeted by accusations of manipulating reviews and strong-arming businesses for advertising revenue. Gripevine’s response to these sentiments is to assist enterprises, especially small & medium sized (SMEs) businesses, to connect quickly with their customers, absorb and make positive use of the waves of online commentary, and exploit value-added features within our proprietary platform to strengthen their brands. Pricing, as well as service, will be attractive to Gripevine business users as we disrupt the online review and social customer service space with our “freemium” model, always providing businesses access to their customers regardless if they pay us or not. 
 
Gripevine’s other competitors are primarily a compilation of complaint sites with rudimentary functionalities. None offer proprietary back-end platform ticket management, like Gripevine. Their primary business model is to offer a bulletin board, or a soapbox community, to accumulate complaint content versus offering resolution or loyalty building capabilities for businesses. 
 
The business model of Gripevine’s competitors relies on traffic arising from search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo, many of which have competing business-review features. To a certain extent, competitors have placed their business model at the mercy of search engine algorithms to favorably index their content. Gripevine’s business model, to provide cloud services to companies, leverages a stronger opportunity for growth and sustainability beyond the simple attempt to post negative traffic. This also opens the opportunity to potentially work with other companies in the social CRM sector who could leverage the value-added attributes of Gripevine. 
 
Competitors have arisen from our established technology, but the succesor platforms have not been able to establish their product as a unique proposition in the market. Most use generic ratings systems or allow users to find nearby points of interest such as restaurants, hotels, theatres, hospitals and more; but without comprehensive features that allow consumers and businesses to connect and for companies to employ online strategies to build loyalty.
