The Company’s History
 
BioAdaptives, Inc., (“BioAdaptives,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 19, 2013, as APEX 8 Inc. From inception through October 21, 2013, the Company was in the developmental stage and conducted virtually no business operations, other than organizational activities and preparation of a registration statement on Form 10-12g (the “Registration Statement”), which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 3, 2013. On June 11, 2013, the SEC staff informed the Company that it had no further comments on this filing.
 
On June 21, 2013, the Company’s sole officer, director and shareholder, Richard Chiang, sold 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, constituting 100% of its issued and outstanding shares, to Ferris Holding Inc., a Nevada corporation (“FHI”), for a purchase price of $40,000. Effective the same date, Mr. Chiang or the Company appointed Barry K. Epling, who was the sole shareholder of FHI, as Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Gerald A. Epling as its President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer and a director; Mr. Chiang then resigned. On September 25, 2013, the Company changed its name to BioAdaptives, Inc.
 
Shortly afterwards, on October 21, 2013, the Company entered into a series of material transactions, acquiring assets, intellectual property and license rights covering the design and manufacture of certain nutraceutical products, and licenses from FHI and BioSwan, Inc. a Nevada corporation that was a wholly owned subsidiary of Hemp, Inc., another Nevada corporation. As part of these transactions, which are discussed more fully in its October 21, 2013, Form 8-K, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of common stock to BioSwan.
 
The BioSwan shares were transferred to Hemp as a dividend on October 25, 2013. The Company then filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC, registering an offering of 2,005,000 shares for distribution by Hemp as a dividend to its shareholders (the additional 5,000 shares permitted rounding-up avoid issuance of fractional shares). On January 10, 2014, the SEC notified the Company that the registration statement was effective and on July 9, 2014, the Company’s shares commenced trading in the Over-the-Counter market under the trading symbol BDPT. 
 
The Company commenced executing its business plan, seeking to develop supply chain, manufacturing and retail distribution to exploit the BioSwan assets. On May 20, 2014, the Company’s PCAOB auditor, Kenne Ruan, P.C., resigned and it appointed Anton & Chia LLP. Thereafter, it went through several management changes: On July 14, 2014, Gerald A. Epling, resigned as an officer and director and the Company appointed Barry K. Epling as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. On February 6, 2015, Barry K. Epling resigned as an officer of the Company but remained as its sole director. On that same day, the Company appointed Christopher G. Hall, as its President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. On May 23, 2o15, the Company also changed its PCAOB auditor, dismissing Anton & Chia, LLP and retaining Malone & Bailey, LLP.

On March 31, 2017, the Company filed a Form 15-15D with the SEC, terminating its status as an SEC-reporting company; it was current in its Continuous Disclosure obligations at that time. The Company continued to provide financial and other reports to shareholders and the public by means of the Alternative Reporting System operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. Its shares continued to trade in the OTC market and it also continued to execute its business plan. 
 
On October 2, 2017, the Board of Directors appointed Kim Southworth and Edward E Jacobs, Jr MD as directors and Barry K. Epling resigned as Chairman. FHI donated 9,628.568 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Breath of Life Foundation, a Section 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. At that time, these shares constituted 51.84% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares and, as part of the grant, Breath of Life granted the Company’s Board of Directors an irrevocable proxy to vote them. With these actions, Barry K. Epling terminated his relationship with the Company as an owner (direct or indirect), officer or director. On that same day, Christopher G. Hall resigned as an officer of the Company (he remains on the Advisory Board); Southworth was appointed Chief Executive Officer; and Edward E Jacobs was appointed Chief Financial officer, Secretary and Scientific Director of the Company.
 
On May 15, 2018, the Board of Directors appointed James E Rouse as a director; the Company also appointed him as President. On July 6, 2018, Southworth resigned from the Company and Dr. Jacobs was appointed Chief Executive Officer in addition to his existing responsibilities. On September 10, 2018, Mr. Rouse resigned as an officer and director of the Company although a company he controls provided consulting services until September 25, 2018. 
 
On May 10, 2019, the Company filed a Form 10-12g with the SEC, re-entering the Continuous Disclosure program and registering its common stock under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On August 1, 2019, the SEC staff informed the Company that it had no further comments on this filing. 
 
On September 11, 2019, the Company appointed Robert Ellis as President and Ron Lambrecht as Chief Financial Officer.
 
On February 6, 2020, the Board of Directors exercised its authority under the Delaware General Corporations Law to establish its Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A has enhanced voting and conversion privileges and can be used by the Company to settle recorded debt or exchange for new product rights or techniques. On this same day, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company’s authorized common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000; holders of a majority of the Company’s common shares consented to the increase. 
The Company’s Business
 
BioAdaptives investigates, markets and distributes natural plant- and algal-based products that improve health and wellness for humans and animals, with an emphasis on pain relief and anti-aging properties. The Company’s current products include dietary supplements using natural ingredients and proprietary methods of optimizing the availability of nutrients in foods and beverages. The human products are designed to aid memory, cognition and focus; assist in sleep and fatigue reduction; provide pain relief and healing; and improve overall emotional and physical wellness. The science behind our human products has proven to be effective for performance enhancement and pain relief for horses and dogs as well as providing improvements in appearance. 
 
Our current product line includes PrimiCell®, PluriPain®, and PrimiLung™ for humans and Canine Regen® and Equine Regen® for dogs and horses. We also market an Equine All-in-One formulation evolved from Equine Regen® to trainers, horse owners and boarding stables. All of these products are sold under licensing and manufacturing agreements. While we continue to investigate and acquire nutraceutical products for humans and animals, all of our current activities are reliant on marketing and distributing products developed and owned by others.
 
We can make no assurances that we will find commercial success in any of our products. We terminated our plans to sell or license our NutraLoad™ and Agronifier™ technology as not commercially viable. We are reliant on direct and indirect sales of the Primi and Pluri lines for human and Regen and the All In One animal products for revenues, neither of which have produced any significant revenue yet. We are a new company and thus have very limited experience in order to develop reliable sales expectations and forecasting.

Market and Marketing
 
We market our science-based, quality nutraceuticals to a broad base of the population in the U.S., and are exploring marketing prospects in Asia, Australasia, the Middle East, and Europe. The Company’s current target markets also include equine and canine companion animals and equine competitors in the U.S., Australasia and the Middle East.
 
We intend to create market share in our target demographic by (i) emphasizing the benefits of our proprietary algal based-all natural, stimulant free, non-GMO ingredients that combine with proven Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic herbs into science-based formulations, (ii) investigating additional products in response to market demand and testing, and (iii) utilizing our marketing operation to act as its sales and distribution arm to seek additional channels for sales coverage. 
 
The Company also plans to capitalize on the significant opportunities for consolidation available in the nutraceutical industry. The Company anticipates seeking acquisitions that serve to increase the number of the Company’s product brands, broaden its product offering or facilitate entry into complementary distribution channels.
 
We are associated with leading veterinarians and equine competitors for both research and marketing purposes. In 2019, the Company formed the Livestock Impact Division, which entered into a business relationship with Livestock Impact, Inc. and its President, Bruce Colclasure, a National Cutting Horse Association champion who owns and operates the Flying C Bar Ranch, the breeder and trainer of over 80 NCHA champion cutting horses. Mr. Colclasure uses and endorses our EquineRegen® and EquineRegen® Plus products and provides valuable feedback and testimonials regarding its function. In 2020, the Company entered into a Marketing and Licensing Agreement with the owners of these products to develop the Equine All-in-One formulation, which we market to trainers, horse owners and boarding facilities. 
 
The Company believes that the population growth in the seasoned and geriatric demographic cohort presents a unique opportunity. The World Health Organization has stated that the 60 years and over population segment will more than double from 11% to over 22% between 2000 and 2050, with the absolute number of people aged 60 and over expected to increase to 2 billion within the same period. The Company also recognizes the rising buying power and interests of the Millennials in wellness products and their choice of communication medium being social media and internet. It intends to establish a major focus to capture the anticipated growth in this sector.
 
The Company believes that international sales represent a significant future growth opportunity as aging population growth outside North America exceeds 1 billion people. The Company plans to aggressively pursue international sales by adding salespeople to its marketing effort, including use of social media influencers, developing a network in high-growth APAC regions, and continuing its efforts to register products and trademarks in attractive foreign markets.
 
Manufacturing
 
All of the Company’s products are considered dietary supplements or natural foods, and we carefully avoid making health, drug or disease cure claims that could trigger regulatory compliance issues and affect our ability to market BioAdaptives products. Our active ingredients are all plant- or algal-based and sourced worldwide from reputable suppliers who employ stringent compliance and sustainable agriculture practices or operate NSF-certified (or equivalent) facilities. 
 
We contract exclusively with manufacturers that utilize pharmaceutical grade facilities to assemble and package our products, all of which is subject to our inspection and approval. Fulfillment of retail internet and direct-to-reseller orders are conducted from our warehouse facilities. BioAdaptives actively investigates new products, techniques and novel applications of existing products or technology in our research. The Company’s research work has centered on investigations of all-natural supplement formulations that activate primitive cells, including stem cells and their derivatives, and natural ingredients that encourage stem cell proliferation.
