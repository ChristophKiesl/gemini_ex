Item 1. | Business

Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing or acquiring technologies that help pharmaceutical companies discover and develop medicines. We employ research technologies such as antibody discovery technologies, ion channel discovery technology, Pseudomonas fluorescens protein expression technology, formulation science and liver targeted pro-drug technologies to assist companies in their work toward securing prescription drug and biologic approvals. We currently have partnerships and license agreements with over 130 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Over 300 programs are in various stages of commercialization, development or research and are fully funded by our collaboration partners and licensees. We have contributed novel research and technologies for approved medicines that treat cancer, osteoporosis, fungal infections and postpartum depression, among others. Our collaboration partners and licensees have programs currently in clinical development targeting cancer, seizure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, muscle wasting, liver disease, and kidney disease, among others. We have over 1,400 issued patents worldwide.
We have assembled our large portfolio of fully-funded programs either by licensing our own proprietary drug development programs, licensing our platform technologies such as Captisol or OmniAb to partners for use with their proprietary programs, or acquiring existing partnered programs from other companies. Fully-funded programs, which we refer to as "shots on goal," are those for which our partners pay all of the development and commercialization costs. For our internal programs, we generally plan to advance drug candidates through early-stage drug development or clinical proof-of-concept and then seek partners to continue development and potential commercialization.
Our business model creates value for stockholders by providing a diversified portfolio of biotech and pharmaceutical product revenue streams that are supported by an efficient and low corporate cost structure. Our goal is to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the promise of the biotech industry in a profitable, diversified and lower-risk business than a typical biotech company. Our business model is based on doing what we do best: drug discovery, early-stage drug development, product reformulation and partnering. We partner with other pharmaceutical companies to leverage what they do best (late-stage development, regulatory management and commercialization) to ultimately generate our revenue. We believe that focusing on discovery and early-stage drug development while benefiting from our partners’ development and commercialization expertise will reduce our internal expenses and allow us to have a larger number of drug candidates progress to later stages of drug development.
Our revenue consists of three primary elements: royalties from commercialized products, sale of Captisol material, and contract revenue from license, milestone and other service payments. In addition to discovering and developing our own proprietary drugs, we selectively pursue acquisitions to bring in new assets, pipelines, and technologies to aid in generating additional potential new revenue streams.

2020 and Recent Major Business Highlights
Major Transactions and Strategic Investments
Consistent with our business model, we pursued novel investments to augment our technology platforms and assets. 
In April 2020, we closed the acquisition of the core assets, partnered programs and ion channel technology from Icagen for $15.1 million in cash. Icagen will also be entitled to receive up to an additional contingent earn-out payment of $25 million based on certain revenue achievements. 
In September 2020, we acquired two privately held companies that strengthen and complement our OmniAb platform's technology stack. We acquired xCella Biosciences, Inc. for $7.1 million in cash plus potential earnouts, and acquired Taurus Biosciences LLC for $5.1 million in cash plus non-transferable CVRs. In addition, we invested $2.5 million in a new company, 
Minotaur Therapeutics, which is led by Taurus Biosciences’ founder, in exchange for royalties on products from future programs.
In October 2020, we acquired Pfenex Inc. including its proprietary protein expression technology and existing collaboration contracts with Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Merck, Serum Institute of India and Alvogen, each of which has the potential to pay royalties. In October 2020, our partner Merck announced additional positive data from two Phase 3 studies with V114, which uses the protein expression technology, evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the investigational 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. In November 2020, Merck announced they had submitted applications to the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for licensure of V114 for use in adults 18 years of age and older. Merck announced on January 12, 2021 that FDA accepted the BLA for V114 for priority review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of July 18, 2021. In December 2020, Jazz Pharmaceuticals initiated the submission of a BLA to the FDA seeking market approval for JZP-458, which is a recombinant Erwinia asparaginase produced using the protein expression platform that has resulted in a robust process showing manufacturing consistency and efficiency. The BLA was initiated and will be reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, an initiative of the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence designed to expedite the delivery of safe and effective cancer treatments to patients.
In December 2020, we sold the Vernalis research operations and internal programs to HitGen Inc. for $26.7 million in cash. Under the terms of the agreement, we retained economic rights on completed collaboration licenses as well as a share of the economic rights on current research collaboration contracts. 
Corporate and Governance Highlights

OmniAb Technology Platform Updates
We continue to invest in and expand the OmniAb Technology platform. We entered into four new OmniAb platform license agreements in 2020 with Pandion Therapeutics, Adept Therapeutics, The Wistar Institute and RubrYc Therapeutics. In addition to the four platform license deals completed in 2020, we estimate that we and our partners initiated over 50 new programs in 2020. Our scientists and our partners presented data highlighting the utility of the OmniAb platform at multiple conferences throughout the year, and we published multiple papers in peer-reviewed journals.
Development-stage OmniAb partners continue to report progress clinically; notable advancements include:
•Janssen presented safety and response data of the OmniAb-derived teclistamab (anti-BCMA x CD3 T cell redirecting bispecific antibody) Phase 1 dose escalation trial for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma at the 2020 American Society for Hematology (ASH) conference. Teclistamab showed a manageable safety profile with an overall response rate (ORR) of 73 percent (16/22) at the recommended subcutaneous (SC) Phase 2 dose. In addition, updated results for the intravenous formulation demonstrate the durability of responses. Janssen announced that it has chosen the recommended Phase 2 dose for the SC formulation.
•Gloria Biosciences submitted an application for marketing approval in China for OmniAb-derived zimberelimab for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, marking multiple OmniAb drug applications filed seeking approval.
•Arcus Biosciences and Taiho Pharmaceutical announced Taiho’s exercise of its option for an exclusive license to zimberelimab (also known as AB122) for Japan and other Asian countries, excluding China.
•CStone announced an agreement to out-license ex-Greater China rights for sugemalimab (CStone licensed worldwide rights from our licensee WuXi) and CS1003 (anti-PD-1) to EQRx. Under the terms of the agreement, CStone will receive an upfront payment of $150 million and is eligible to receive up to $1.15 billion in milestone payments as well as separate tiered royalties. EQRx will obtain exclusive rights to lead development and commercialization worldwide, excluding certain territories in Asia. In October 2020, CStone entered into a major partnership with Pfizer for the commercialization of sugemalimab in greater China. As part of the partnership, Pfizer invested $200 million in CStone shares, and CStone is eligible to receive up to $280 million in milestone payments and additional royalties. 
•CStone announced that China’s National Medical Products Administration accepted CStone’s New Drug Application for sugemalimab combined with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced squamous and non-squamous 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CStone previously announced updated results from two clinical studies of sugemalimab at the 2020 Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting and announced that sugemalimab met the primary endpoint as first-line treatment in stage IV squamous and non-squamous NSCLC. 
•CStone and Blueprint Medicines initiated a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of fisogatinib in combination with OmniAb-derived CS1001 for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. CStone announced the first patient was dosed in a proof-of-concept study of OmniAb-derived CS1001 in combination with Bayer's regorafenib in patients with advanced solid tumors.
•Aptevo announced two complete remissions in the ongoing APVO436 Phase 1/1b clinical trial for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Preliminary data indicating that OmniAb-derived APVO436 was well tolerated with a manageable safety profile were presented at the 2020 ASH conference.
•Immunovant announced positive results from its Phase 2a proof-of-concept study of OmniAb-derived IMVT-1401 (also known as batoclimab, HL161, or HBM9161) in thyroid eye disease. IMVT-1401 is a novel investigational anti-FcRn antibody delivered by subcutaneous injection. The results showed a 65% mean reduction in total IgG observed from baseline to end of treatment, with a pharmacodynamic response nearly identical to modeled predictions for the dosing regimen tested in the trial. In February 2021, Immunovant announced a voluntary pause in its ongoing clinical trials of IMVT-1401 due to elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels in Phase 2b trial of thyroid eye disease. Immunovant announced that it plans to continue development of IMVT-1401 following discussions with regulators and protocol modifications. In addition, Immunovant announced positive topline results from a multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase 2a trial (ASCEND MG) of IMVT-1401, in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). 
•Harbour announced first patient dosing of Phase 1b/2a study of Batoclimab for treating neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. On January 27, 2021 Harbour announced that China Center for Drug Evaluation granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Batoclimab for the treatment of adult patients with MG. This designation indicates that the development and review of Batoclimab in adults with MG will be expedited. 
Captisol Technology Updates
Our Captisol business unit achieved its highest sales ever in 2020 and we anticipate substantial continued demand for Captisol. We are investing to significantly expand annual manufacturing capacity for Captisol. 
Gilead utilizes Captisol to solubilize the active ingredient for Veklury® (remdesivir), the first FDA approved anti-viral treatment for severe COVID-19. The drug has now been authorized or approved for use in numerous countries around the world. Gilead announced the formation of a consortium of generic pharmaceutical companies to manufacture remdesivir for the developing world. We have supplied, established initial agreements or are in supply discussions with those companies, and are prepared to meet the Captisol needs of all companies manufacturing remdesivir as well as the needs from our other Captisol partners.
We made the decision to conduct a Phase 2 trial for Captisol-enabled Iohexol that we believe could serve as the basis for potential registration of the product candidate. CE-Iohexol is an iodine-based contrast agent for hospital-based imaging procedures. The market for iodinated contrast agents is substantial, with approximately 20 million imaging procedures per year in the U.S., representing an estimated $1.5 billion in sales. The objective of the CE-Iohexol clinical trial will be to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury and an equivalent image quality compared to GE’s Omnipaque®.
Vernalis Design Platform (VDP) Updates
In December 2020, we sold our Vernalis research operations and internal programs to HitGen Inc. for $26.7 million in cash. Under the terms of the agreement, we retain economic rights on completed collaboration licenses as well as a share of the economic rights on current research collaboration contracts. We continued to expand our portfolio of VDP-derived partnerships during 2020, prior to the sale. Notable VDP developments include:
•We entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Neuritek Therapeutics to develop and commercialize V158866, a novel oral, selective fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor that was discovered using the Vernalis Design Platform. Neuritek plans to develop V158866 for post-traumatic stress disorder and other CNS diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront license fee and are eligible to receive over $240 million in milestones and tiered royalties on net sales of six to eight percent. Neuritek has secured approximately $27 million in a capital commitment from GEM Global Yield LLC SCS.
•In February 2021, Verona Pharma announced ensifentrine delivered by a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) met all of the primary and secondary lung function endpoints in the 7 day, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The magnitude of improvement in lung function was dose-ordered and highly statistically significant at peak and over the 12-hour dosing interval compared with placebo, and supports twice-daily dosing of ensifentrine via pMDI for the treatment of COPD. Verona is evaluating nebulized ensifentrine in the pivotal Phase 3 ENHANCE-1 and 2 clinical trials for COPD maintenance treatment. 
Icagen Technology Platform Updates

We continue to advance partnership programs following our 2020 acquisition of the core assets from Icagen Inc. The following developments occurred in 2020:
•In May of 2020 we expanded our license with Roche by adding a second program to our agreement initiated in December 2018. This new program incorporates Icagen’s ion channel technology and is directed at a specific ion channel target relevant to neurodegenerative disease. Roche made a cash upfront payment and provides research funding to Icagen for this second program. In addition, Icagen is eligible to receive development and commercialization milestones up to $274 million for each program and royalty payments should a drug be commercialized from any of the collaboration’s programs.
•In December 2020, we signed a collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline to identify and develop inhibitors of specific genetically-validated molecular targets relevant to neurological diseases. Under the terms of this agreement we received an upfront payment of $7 million and could receive development, regulatory and commercialization milestones up to $155 million. We will also receive tiered royalties on net sales should any drug from the collaboration be commercialized.
•We continue to advance other programs including our collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation targeting nonsense suppression as well as multiple internal programs which potentially offer future partnering opportunities.
Other Business Updates
On February 2, 2021, our partner, Travere, announced that sparsentan achieved its pre-specified interim FSGS partial remission of proteinuria endpoint (FPRE) in the DUPLEX study after 36 weeks of treatment. Sparsentan demonstrated a statistically significant response on FPRE compared to the active control, irbesartan (p=0.0094). Preliminary results from the interim analysis suggest that sparsentan has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a comparable safety profile to irbesartan. Based on the data from the interim analysis, Travere intends to pursue submissions for accelerated approval of sparsentan for FSGS in the second half of 2021. In January the FDA granted sparsentan Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of IgA nephropathy, and on February 18, 2021, Travere announced the European Commission (EC) had granted orphan designation to sparsentan for the treatment of IgA nephropathy. Topline efficacy data from the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 PROTECT Study in IgA nephropathy, and the 36-week interim proteinuria endpoint analysis, are anticipated in the third quarter of 2021.

Sparsentan (Travere) 
Our partner, Travere, is developing sparsentan for orphan indications of severe kidney diseases, and is running an on-going global pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (DUPLEX) for sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS. Additionally, Travere is running 
a global pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (PROTECT) evaluating the long-term nephroprotective potential of sparsentan for the treatment of IgA nephropathy, a rare, immune complex mediated chronic glomerular disease. Certain patient groups with severely compromised renal function, including those with FSGS and IgA nephropathy, exhibit extreme proteinuria resulting in progression to dialysis and a high mortality rate. Sparsentan, with its unique dual blockade of angiotensin and endothelin receptors, is expected to provide meaningful clinical benefits in mitigating proteinuria in indications where there are no approved therapies.
In February of 2021, Travere announced that sparsentan achieved its pre-specified interim FSGS partial remission of proteinuria endpoint (FPRE) in the DUPLEX Phase 3 study after 36 weeks of treatment. Sparsentan demonstrated a statistically significant response on FPRE compared to the active control, irbesartan (p=0.0094). Preliminary results from the interim analysis suggest that sparsentan has been generally well-tolerated and has shown a comparable safety profile to irbesartan. Based on the data from the interim analysis, Travere intends to pursue submissions for accelerated approval of sparsentan for FSGS in the second half of 2021.
Travere has stated that topline efficacy data from the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 PROTECT Study in IgA nephropathy, and the 36-week interim proteinuria endpoint analysis, are anticipated in the third quarter of 2021.
Under our license agreement with Travere, we may be entitled to receive potential milestones of over $70 million and net royalties on future worldwide sales by Travere.

We are also entitled to receive tiered royalties should any drug from the collaboration be commercialized. We will be responsible for the majority of preclinical activities up to lead optimization with both Ligand and GSK collaborating to identify candidates of IND-enabling studies. GSK has the exclusive option to license any identified inhibitors and will be responsible for further development and commercialization of any drug candidates identified through the collaboration.
Roche Collaboration
In December 2018, prior to the acquisition by Ligand, Icagen entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Roche to develop and commercialize small molecule ion channel modulators for the treatment of neurological disorders and in May 2020 amended the license and collaboration agreement to include a second target. These programs incorporate our technology platform for ion channel drug discovery and are directed at specific ion channel targets expressed in neurons. Under the terms of the agreement, Roche paid us on a per target basis an upfront payment for program exclusivity and research funding. In addition, we are eligible to potentially receive development and commercial milestone payments of up to $274 million per program and royalty payments if a drug is commercialized. We will be responsible for most preclinical activities up to lead optimization with both us and Roche applying resources to identify candidates for entry into late stage preclinical and IND enabling studies. Thereafter, Roche will be responsible for the further development and commercialization of the programs.
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Collaboration
In May 2018, prior to the acquisition by Ligand, Icagen announced an award of up to $11 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for a project focused on the discovery of therapeutics to treat patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) caused by nonsense mutations. Nonsense mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (“CFTR”) gene result in the premature termination of protein synthesis and the formation of truncated, non-functional CFTR. Patients with these mutations in both copies of their CFTR genes currently have no therapies that treat the underlying cause of their disease. The aim of this program is to provide these patients with a transformative therapeutic that will markedly improve their quality of life and lifespan. The award is to support an integrated, multi-year drug discovery initiative. At the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in October 2020, we reported the identification and characterization of a class of small molecule agents that enhance CFTR-PTC mutant readthrough and enable functional CFTR currents in combination with aminoglycosides.

Internal Development Programs 
We have a number of internal development or unpartnered programs focused on a wide-range of potential indications or disease. 
The Captisol-enabled (CE)-Iohexol program was established in January 2018 to develop a next-generation contrast agent for diagnostic imaging with a reduced risk of renal toxicity. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is the acute impairment of renal function following intravascular administration of an iodinated contrast agent, and occurs most frequently following coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention and contrast-enhanced computed tomography, especially among patients at risk of renal injury such as those with advanced age, diabetes or heart failure. Currently no products are approved to prevent or treat CI-AKI in this setting, and therefore we believe a significant opportunity exists for a safer formulation of contrast agents. The goal is for CE-Iohexol to improve upon the limitations of existing contrast agents and enable a future partner to gain meaningful market share. In July 2019, we announced positive top-line results from a Phase 1 clinical trial CE-Iohexol conducted in Canada. The trial achieved the primary endpoint by demonstrating pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of CE-Iohexol injection and a reference Iohexol injection (OMNIPAQUE™) after IV administration in healthy adults. CE-Iohexol injection was well tolerated, and adverse events were in line with the known safety profile of OMNIPAQUE. We submitted an IND with the FDA in November and received a “Study May Proceed” letter in December 2020 along with feedback from the FDA on the clinical plan. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2021.
The Luminespib/Hsp90 Inhibitor is a Phase 2-ready Hsp90 inhibitor, previously investigated in clinical trials for cancer. Third-party academic drug analyses suggest a potential role for heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors in treating COVID-19 infection. Based on these studies, we are evaluating potential collaborations or partnerships relating to intravenous luminespib (AUY-922) as a potential treatment for patients with COVID-19. 
Our primary research and development efforts are led by our teams in Emeryville, California, San Diego, California, and Durham, North Carolina,. The following table represents internal programs eligible for further development or partnership:

Program | Development Stage | Targeted Indication or Disease
CE-Iohexol | Phase 2 | Diagnostics 
Luminespib/Hsp90 Inhibitor | Phase 2 | Oncology

Anti-CD38 | Preclinical | Oncology 
Anti-BDNF | Preclinical | Oncology 
PF529 Pegfilgrastim | Preclinical | Oncology 
PF810 Recombinant Peptide | Preclinical | Endocrine System 

Manufacturing
We contract with a third party manufacturer, Hovione, for Captisol production. Hovione operates FDA-inspected sites in the United States, Macau, Ireland and Portugal. Manufacturing and distribution operations for Captisol are performed primarily at Hovione's Portugal and Ireland facilities. We believe we maintain adequate inventory of Captisol to meet our current and future partner needs.
In the event of a Captisol supply interruption, we are permitted to designate and, with Hovione’s assistance, qualify one or more alternate suppliers. If the supply interruption continues beyond a designated period, we may terminate the agreement. In addition, if Hovione cannot supply our requirements of Captisol due to an uncured force majeure event, we may also obtain Captisol from a third party and have previously identified such parties.
The current term of the agreement with Hovione is through December 2024. The agreement will automatically renew for successive two year renewal terms unless either party gives written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement no less than two years prior to the expiration of the initial term or renewal term. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party or an extended force majeure event. We may terminate the agreement for extended supply interruption, regulatory action related to Captisol or other specified events. We have ongoing minimum purchase commitments under the agreement.
Competition
Some of the drugs we and our licensees and partners are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors.
Our Captisol business may face competition from other suppliers of similar cyclodextrin excipients or other technologies that are aimed to increase solubility or stability of APIs. Our OmniAb antibody technology faces competition from suppliers of other transgenic animal systems that are also available for antibody drug discovery such as AbCellera Biologics.
Our competitive position also depends upon our ability to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes. For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)
We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace, promoting environmental excellence in our communities, and complying with all relevant regulations and industry standards. We establish and monitor programs to reduce pollution, prevent injuries, and maintain compliance with applicable regulations. By focusing on such practices, we believe we can affect a meaningful, positive change in our community and maintain a healthy and safe environment. Our animal health facility in Emeryville, California, has accreditation from Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC), a nonprofit organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs. We expect to continue our effort and to refine our EHS policies and practices in 2021.
Government Regulation
The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. We and our partners, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products. These activities are subject to additional regulations that apply at the state level. There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed products and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our partners. For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Patents are issued or pending for the following key products or product families. The scope and type of patent protection provided by each patent family is defined by the claims in the various patents. Patent term may vary by jurisdiction and depend on a number of factors including potential patent term adjustments, patent term extensions, and terminal disclaimers. For each product or product family, the patents and/or applications referred to are in force in at least the United States, and for most products and product families, the patents and/or applications are also in force in European jurisdictions, Japan and other jurisdictions.
Kyprolis
Patents protecting Kyprolis include those owned by Amgen and those owned by us. The United States patent listed in the Orange Book relating to Kyprolis with the latest expiration date is not expected to expire until 2029. Patents and applications owned by Ligand relating to the Captisol component of Kyprolis are not expected to expire until 2033. Amgen has filed suit against several generic drug companies over their applications to make generic versions of Kyprolis. Several generics have settled with Amgen on confidential terms. However, it has been publicly reported that the U.S. launch date for at least Breckenridge Pharmaceuticals’ generic product will be on a date that is held as confidential in 2027 or sooner, depending on certain occurrences. One generic company, Cipla Limited/Cipla USA, Inc. chose not to settle the litigation with Amgen, and proceeded to trial. The District Court upheld the validity of patent claims from three of the patents and Cipla has appealed. The type of patent protection (e.g., composition of matter or use) for each patent listed in the Orange Book and the expiration dates for each patent listed in the Orange Book are provided in the following table. In addition, certain related patents in the commercially important jurisdictions of Europe and Japan are identified in the following table.
