CORPORATE STRATEGY
The rate of content creation and the acceleration of digitization are having a tremendous impact on the media industry and altering the industry value chain. Today’s consumers are empowered to create and consume content on-demand, anywhere, anytime. Organizations in the media industry are under pressure to connect and automate the entire creation-to-consumption workflow, and are facing a number of challenges, including:
•Increasing rate of content creation and digitization of media assets - Many organizations are feeling intense pressure to create more and more content, increasingly tailored for audience niches, while also facing greater competition from nimble players. At the same time, access to creative software tools is wider today than ever before, giving more people the ability to tell their stories.
•Exponential growth of distribution platforms - The number of distribution platforms continues to expand, and the economic models of new distribution platforms are still evolving. To satisfy their customers, organizations need to develop or license content for their distribution platforms. Many organizations need to embrace new opportunities while also maximizing heritage business.
•Continued increase in content consumption - There has been a tremendous increase in viewership in the last decade, but it is spread across many outlets and channels. This increase in viewership is dwarfed by an increase in competitive content. In addition, with growing audience fragmentation, compelling content, brand equity, and relevance are critical.
•Disparate mix of tools, skills, and workflows - Lack of commonality and a fragmented supplier landscape creates incompatibilities, inhibiting of tools, which inhibits agility, collaboration, sharing, and efficiency.
•Media technology budgets - Today’s economic realities are placing pressure on media technology budgets, while media companies feel increased pressure to expand content output to deliver on the market requirements. Many content creators and distributors have to work with essentially flat budgets, which demands more efficient workflows and solutions.
We believe we are well positioned in the media technology industry because we have a set of differentiated creative software tools (including ProTools for audio and Media Composer for video), a differentiated platform strategy (Avid MediaCentral platform described below) and a well-established market position. Our products and solutions allow our customers to (i) create high-quality, engaging, and immersive content, (ii) distribute to more outlets and devices, (iii) maximize and protect the value of media assets, and (iv) create operational and capital efficiency. As a result of our market position across the media industry, we believe we can take advantage of the following opportunities and trends:
•Large and growing market poised for transition - Our customers are facing significant disruption and need to make major changes and investments in their business and operational approaches to address the challenges described above. Our product offerings help them address those challenges.
•Deeply entrenched with a market leadership position - We can strategically leverage a significant global customer base that is loyal to our brand across TV, film, music, and media. 
•Positioned to help the industry navigate disruption - Our unique approach encompasses a common technology platform, leading software applications and integrated solutions with a large and open ecosystem, which we believe differentiates us from many of our competitors.
•Ready to intercept the next emerging opportunity - By leveraging our partnership with Microsoft and our MediaCentral platform, we believe we can lead the media and entertainment industry into the cloud with market-leading Software as a Service, or SAAS, offerings.
Our strategy for connecting creative professionals and media enterprises with audiences in a powerful, efficient, collaborative, and profitable way leverages our creative software tools, including Pro Tools for audio and Media Composer for video, and our MediaCentral Platform - the open, extensible, and customizable foundation that streamlines and simplifies content workflows by integrating all Avid or third-party products and services that run on top of it. The platform provides secure and protected access, and enables fast and easy creation, delivery, and monetization of content.
A key element of our strategy is our transition to a recurring revenue-based model through a combination of subscription offerings, maintenance contracts, and long-term agreements. We started offering subscription licensing options for some of our products and solutions in 2014 and by the end of 2022 we offered subscription licensing for all of our software solutions and we had approximately 506,000 paid subscriptions. Subscription count includes all paid and active seats under multi-seat licenses. These licensing options offer choices in pricing and deployment to suit our customers’ needs. We expect to increase subscription sales to media enterprises going forward as we expand offerings and move through customer upgrade cycles, which we expect will further increase recurring revenue on a longer-term basis. Our long-term agreements are comprised of multi-year agreements with large media enterprise customers to provide specified products and services, including SAAS offerings, and agreements with channel partners and resellers to purchase minimum amounts of products and service over a specified period of time.
Avid is committed to our digital transformation initiative, which focuses on optimizing systems, processes, and back-office functions with the objective of improving our operations related to our digital and subscription business. The initiative started in the third quarter of 2021, and is expected to continue through 2024. We plan to significantly invest in transforming our enterprise-wide infrastructure and technologies to benefit customers and drive enhanced performance across the company.

Enterprise Software Solutions
Avid’s Enterprise Software Solutions are built on the MediaCentral platform along with a suite of applications, modules, and services and is also the foundation of our cloud and SAAS offerings.
MediaCentral
MediaCentral | Cloud UX is Avid’s next-generation media production suite that further extends the Avid MediaCentral platform into the cloud. The MediaCentral platform scales from the simplest to the most sophisticated solutions. Built on a customizable cloud native microservices architecture, MediaCentral platform features a cloud-based user experience that runs on any device, as well as workflow modules for editorial, production, news, graphics, and asset management. It also features applications to enhance and scale any of those modules, and a wide array of media services and partner connectors. Every user is connected in a completely integrated workflow environment with a user-friendly interface, and gains a unified view into all their media with flexible deployment options for on premises, hybrid, or cloud (public/private) environments.
As part of the Avid MediaCentral platform, we also offer Avid NEXIS | EDGE, (formally known as Editorial Management) a module for smaller creative teams that provides the same robust media management capabilities used by the largest media enterprises in the industry. Integrated within Media Composer via a panel, NEXIS | EDGE connects directly to Avid NEXIS storage to provide easy access to media with hyper-search functionality. Avid NEXIS | EDGE also extends collaboration capabilities for the assistant editor in an easy-to-use web interface by allowing Media Composer bin creation, logging, and search capabilities, greatly expanding the efficiency of creative teams.
SAAS Solutions
Avid | Edit On Demand, our first enterprise SaaS offering, provides a full SaaS-based virtual post-production environment in the cloud – complete with cloud-optimized Media Composer and Avid NEXIS storage.
We have a strategic partnership with Microsoft to deliver Azure-certified solutions to support end-to-end hybrid and cloud deployments of media production and news workflows. Our partnership includes developing virtualized versions of many of our product offerings, allowing them to run in a private cloud, public cloud, or in hybrid deployments. This enables customers to migrate to more traditional IT infrastructures leveraging IP technology to integrate disparate systems within a 
post production and broadcast environment. We believe our new SAAS and cloud offerings allow our customers to (i) achieve the flexibility they require to keep up with the constantly rising demand for media production, ii) scale based on business needs to lower costs, (iii) enable anytime access, boosting efficiency and collaboration, and (iv) deliver content quickly and securely to any device, from anywhere. Our first enterprise SAAS offering, Edit on Demand, has been deployed in post production and news environments.
Integrated Solutions
The Integrated Solutions part of our portfolio mainly consists of four common, best-in-class hardware platforms that are combined with tightly integrated software elements to create powerful and differentiated solutions, all of which complement and enhance our overall software strategy.
Avid NEXIS
Our Avid NEXIS family of shared storage systems are real-time, open solutions that bring the power of shared storage to local, regional, national and multinational broadcasters, and post-production facilities at competitive prices. Customers can improve allocation of creative resources and support changing project needs with an open, shared storage platform that includes file system technology on lower cost hardware, support for third-party applications, and streamlined administration to create more content at an affordable price. Avid NEXIS is the industry’s first and only software-defined storage platform specifically designed for storing and managing media. Avid NEXIS enables fully virtualized storage so media organizations can adjust storage capacity mid-project, without disrupting workflows. Powered by our MediaCentral Platform, Avid NEXIS delivers media storage flexibility, scalability, and control for both Avid-based and third-party workflows. It has been designed to serve small production teams as powerfully as large media enterprises and is built with flexibility to grow with customers through their business stages. In addition to on-premises Avid NEXIS workflows, Avid NEXIS Cloud provides on-line, nearline and archive storage tiers in the cloud, and is a key component of our SAAS offerings. Beginning in 2022, we started offering NEXIS | Flex storage management software as a subscription, separately from the underlying Avid NEXIS storage system or Avid NEXIS Cloud storage.
Avid S4 and S6
Our Avid S4 and S6 product line offers customers a range of large format control surfaces for sound recording and mixing, leveraging Avid’s widely supported EUCON control protocol to provide cross platform DAW mixing solutions for customers ranging from the independent professional to the TV and Feature Film enterprises. The Avid S4 and S6 was designed as a modular solution that scales to meet both current and future customer requirements. It was designed for audio professionals in demanding production environments, delivering the performance needed to complete projects faster while producing high quality mixes. 
Avid S1 and Dock
The Avid Dock and Avid S1 audio control surfaces satisfy both enthusiasts and professional mixing workflows in small to mid-sized studios and sound design suites.

Maestro
Our Maestro product line offers customers comprehensive production graphics solutions, ideal for any type of production needs in news, sports, and entertainment, creating greater accessibility, efficiency at scale to enable the delivery of content with graphics faster. Maestro features a core platform that includes a powerful render engine and featured design tool called Maestro | Designer that drives a line-up of applications that are designed to address the specific challenges broadcasters face when automating the integration of statistics and graphics for the creation of an engaging broadcast. By tightly integrating Maestro with MediaCentral we enable journalists and producers to add graphics remotely to news stories or enhance any story with innovative stats to drive augmented reality graphics for presenting data in new and compelling ways. Beginning in 2022, we started offering our Maestro solutions as a subscription that can run on general purpose servers and graphics cards.
FastServe
Our FastServe video server product line assists broadcasters in making the move to UHD and IP based workflows with a new, modular architecture. The Avid FastServe family integrates with the MediaCentral platform, empowering creative teams to deliver content fast for news, sports, entertainment, and other media productions.

We have recently updated our Pro Tools Hardware portfolio with new offerings including, Pro Tools| Carbon Pre and MBOX Studio providing a lower cost audio interface solution for enthusiasts and professional content creators.
Maintenance
We offer a variety of maintenance contracts for our software and integrated solutions, allowing each customer to select the level of technical and operational support that they need to maintain their operational effectiveness. Maintenance contracts typically include the right to the latest software updates, call support, and, in some cases, hardware maintenance. Maintenance contracts for individual products are sold bundled with initial product offerings or as renewals once initial contracts have lapsed. Maintenance contracts are also sold on an enterprise basis where a customer purchases maintenance for all Avid products owned. Our Customer Care team provides customers with a partner committed to giving them help and support when they need it. Our global Customer Care team of industry professionals offers a blend of technology expertise and real-world experience throughout the audio, visual, and entertainment industries.

The Learning Services team 
includes the Avid Certification program which validates the skills and competency of Avid users, administrators, instructors, support representatives, and developers.

OPERATIONS
Sales and Services Channels 
We market and sell our products and solutions through a combination of direct, indirect, and digital sales channels. Our direct sales channel consists of internal sales representatives serving select customers and markets. Our indirect sales channels include global networks of independent distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, and retailers. Our digital sales channel is represented by the online Avid Marketplace. We also sell digitally through the Xchange Market Platform, or XMP, with some of our key partners and distributors.
We have significant international operations with offices in 17 countries and the ability to reach customers in approximately 173 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and resellers. Sales to customers outside the United States accounted for 57%, 58% and 60% of our total net revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additional information about the geographic breakdown of our revenues can be found in Note P to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For additional information about risks associated with our international operations, see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to our International Operations” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
We generally ship our products shortly after the receipt of an order. However, a high percentage of our revenues has historically been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter and concentrated in the latter part of that month. Orders that may exist at the end of a quarter and have not been shipped are not recognized as revenues in that quarter and are included in revenue backlog.
We provide customer care services directly through regional in-house and contracted support centers and major-market field service representatives. We also provide customer care services indirectly through dealers, value-added resellers, and authorized third-party service providers. Depending on the solution, customers may choose from a variety of support offerings, including telephone and online technical support, on-site assistance, hardware replacement and extended warranty, and software upgrades. In addition to customer care services, we offer a broad array of professional services, including installation, integration, planning and consulting services, and customer training.
Manufacturing and Suppliers 
Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of a network of contract manufacturers around the globe to manufacture many of our products, components and subassemblies, and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, from whom we purchase finished assemblies. Our products undergo testing and quality assurance at the final assembly stage. We depend on sole-source suppliers for many key hardware product components and finished goods, including some critical items. 
Our contract manufacturers and OEMs manufacture our products at a relatively limited number of facilities located throughout the world and, in most cases, the manufacturing of each of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. For additional information about risks associated with our sole source suppliers and manufacturing operations, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Research and Development
We are committed to delivering best-in-class digital media content-creation solutions that are designed for the unique needs, skills and sophistication levels of our target customer markets as well as a standardized media platform for the media industry. We have research and development, or R&D, operations in six facilities located in five countries. Our R&D efforts are focused on the development of digital media content-creation, distribution, and monetization tools as well as the media platform. These tools operate primarily on the Mac and on Windows platforms, whereas the media platform primarily operates on Linux platforms. Our R&D efforts also include highly optimized media storage solutions, standards-based media transfer and media asset management tools, and ingest and playout solutions to cover the entire workflow. Our R&D expenditures for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $66.9 million, $65.6 million and $57.0 million, respectively, which represented 16% of our total net revenues in each year.
We prioritize research and development investments to take advantage of market opportunities based on the following short-term, medium-term, and long-term horizons:
•Here & Now - Improve performance, solidify core portfolio, improve margins, and ignite growth. 
•Emerging - Expand opportunities by pursuing growth areas, extending our product portfolio, and expanding market opportunities.
•Transformational - Build for the future, creating unique defensible differentiation in our products and solutions with disruptive and visionary innovation.
Our company-operated R&D operations are located in: Burlington, Massachusetts; Berkeley, California; London, United Kingdom; Madrid, Spain; Munich, Germany; Kfar Saba, Israel; Szczecin, Poland; and Montreal, Canada. We also partner with a vendor in Kiev, Ukraine for outsourced R&D services, which vendor has relocated as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

We have obtained patents and have registered copyrights, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in many foreign countries. At January 23, 2023, we held 112 U.S. patents, with expiration dates through 2041, and had 14 patent applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered or applied to register various trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries, including Avid, Avid NEXIS, AirSpeed, FastServe, MediaCentral, Media Composer, Pro Tools, and Sibelius.

information about risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We are intentional about creating an environment where our employees can thrive and feel included, empowered, and passionate about our products and customers. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,485 full-time employees and 395 external contractors located globally in 34 countries. Of these, 37% were located in the United States, Canada, and Latin America, 43% in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and 20% in Asia-Pacific. 
As we have emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have returned to our new normal, stronger than ever. In 2022, we worked to compete and differentiate in a highly competitive talent market by focusing on our employer brand and unique culture. We welcomed 272 new employees, of varying backgrounds, around the world representing all types of diversity. We have evolved our Work from Anywhere policy to embrace a combination of hybrid and remote workers. This allows our employees around the globe to gather in our key offices in order to build and enhance personal connections, improve communication, foster collaboration, and ensure the contributions of all employees across our teams. We have further adopted our TeamAvid Community, so we can virtually share communications, collaborate, and engage with each other from anywhere across our business.
We believe that there is power in each individual to enhance opportunities through experiences that help them grow and develop in their career. Our managers hold quarterly check ins with each member of their team to discuss performance, the business, and future career interests. We have expanded beyond our Avid University platform, to provide additional opportunities to learn about our business, products, customers, and keys to success. 
We believe our company culture is a differentiator for us, and critical to our success. We bring our values to life by articulating what they look like in practice and recognizing people and teams that exemplify them. They serve as an anchor during times of uncertainty and challenge. We have employed an employee listening strategy to understand the sentiment of our people across the employee lifecycle. We have moved from an annual eNPS survey to a more frequent cadence and work with our leaders to use this feedback to help keep our employees enthusiastic about Avid, and passionate about being on a winning team.
