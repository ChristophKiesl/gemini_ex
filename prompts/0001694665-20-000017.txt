Overview
Evelo Biosciences is discovering and developing oral biologics that are intended to act on cells in the small intestine to produce systemic therapeutic effects. These cells play a central role in governing the immune, metabolic and neurological systems throughout the body. We refer to this relationship as the small intestinal axis, or SINTAX™. The importance of SINTAX as a therapeutic target has only recently become appreciated and we have built a platform to discover and develop novel oral biologics which target SINTAX. These therapeutics have the potential to be effective, safe and affordable medicines and to transform the treatment of major diseases, driving profound benefits to patients and society.
Our first product candidates are monoclonal microbials: orally delivered pharmaceutical compositions derived from naturally occurring, specific single strains of microbes. Monoclonal microbials engage immune cells in the small intestine and drive changes in systemic biology without systemic exposure and without colonizing the gut. We have observed in preclinical studies that specific monoclonal microbials can downregulate or upregulate immune responses throughout the body by acting on SINTAX.
We believe that monoclonal microbials have the potential to address patient needs at all stages of disease due to their potentially superior characteristics over current therapies:

• | Each of our monoclonal microbial clinical candidates acts through multiple clinically relevant and validated biological pathways in preclinical models. By acting on multiple pathways simultaneously, we believe monoclonal microbials could impact disease in ways that are not possible with current single-target or dual-target therapies.


• | We believe our monoclonal microbials are likely to be well-tolerated given that they are derived from naturally occurring, specific single strains of human microbes that engage immune cells in the small intestine and drive changes in systemic biology without systemic exposure and without colonizing the gut. Our initial clinical data supports this potential and if we are able to validate this profile in future clinical trials, we believe monoclonal microbials have the potential to be used at all stages of disease and in many more patients than current immunomodulatory drugs.


• | Our discovery and development of monoclonal microbials has the potential to be more efficient than other therapeutic classes such as cell therapy, monoclonal antibodies and small molecules. We believe that monoclonal microbials do not require the lengthy target validation and compound discovery requirements of conventional drug discovery.

In August 2019 and November 2019, we reported positive interim clinical data from two cohorts in the ongoing Phase 1b trial of EDP1815, an investigational monoclonal microbial for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Each cohort consisted of individuals with mild to moderate psoriasis who received either a low dose or high dose of EDP1815 or placebo. EDP1815 was well-tolerated in both cohorts, with no overall difference reported from placebo. A reduction in mean lesion severity score ("LSS") and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ("PASI") score was observed at the end of the 28-day dosing period in both cohorts of individuals dosed with EDP1815. In the high dose cohort alone, individuals dosed with EDP1815 showed a continued reduction in both mean LSS (of 24% vs. placebo of 7%) and PASI score (of 21% vs. placebo of 3%) at 42 days, two weeks after completion of dosing, which we believe may be indicative of sustained clinical activity and dose response. Based on the strength of these data, we plan to advance EDP1815 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2020.
We are also developing an investigational monoclonal microbial, EDP1503, in oncology. We initiated our clinical trial of EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in multiple oncology indications in December 2018. In November 2019, we announced that the microsatellite stable colorectal cancer cohort has been fully recruited. No complete or partial clinical responses have been evident, however, several individuals in this cohort have shown extended stable disease. Changes in cellular infiltration biomarkers were also observed in tumor biopsies taken from these individuals during the EDP1503 monotherapy period, which we believe are consistent with preclinical observations for EDP1503. We continue to monitor individuals in this cohort and we expect to report additional clinical data during the first half of 2020. 
We continue to nominate potential clinical candidates from our discovery program for development, alongside our broad research efforts to uncover the full potential of targeting SINTAX. For example, we expect to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating EDP1867, a non-replicating monoclonal microbial clinical candidate designed to address inflammatory diseases, in individuals with asthma in the second half of 2020. EDP1632, a monoclonal microbial candidate for neuro-inflammatory diseases, is also advancing through preclinical development. We have also nominated our first clinical candidate utilizing a reduced form of monoclonal microbials, EDP2939. 
We believe monoclonal microbials and our platform targeting SINTAX have broad potential utility beyond our initial therapeutic focus areas of inflammatory diseases and oncology. We plan to explore opportunities in which our platform has the potential to transform the treatment of diseases, in areas like neuroinflammation and metabolism.

Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our current product candidates are illustrated below.
Notes:
(1) We intend to evaluate EDP1815 in additional indications pending the results of interim data from the planned EDP1815 Phase 2 clinical trial. Potential indications include psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
(2) The Phase 1/2 study of EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA is being conducted in a clinical collaboration with MSD International GmbH, an affiliate of Merck & Co, Inc, ("Merck").
Our Strategy
Our goal is to create and develop a new class of therapies that has the potential to transform the treatment of a broad range of diseases by targeting SINTAX. 
Key elements of our strategy:

• | Explore the full potential of SINTAX to create an expansive and diversified product portfolio. We believe targeting SINTAX has applicability across a broad range of disease areas and we are committed to pursuing opportunities in which our platform has the potential to transform their treatment. Our initial focus is on inflammatory diseases and oncology. We intend to expand into other disease areas, such as autoimmune diseases, respiratory diseases, neuro-inflammation and degeneration, liver diseases, type I diabetes, food allergy, neurobehavior, cardiovascular disease and diseases of metabolism.


• | Develop best-in-class therapies to improve outcomes across various stages of disease. We intend to develop best-in-class orally delivered therapies and explore the potential of monoclonal microbials across the full spectrum of disease severity, not only in patients with severe or advanced disease. We intend to pursue what we believe to be the inherent advantages of monoclonal microbials to enable use in all stages of disease.


• | Advance and scale our monoclonal microbials platform. We plan to continue to invest in our platform, which integrates microbiology, immunology and computational biology capabilities. We intend to expand the diversity of our monoclonal microbial library and enhance our proprietary in vitro and in vivo models to optimize selection of our future product candidates. Our manufacturing processes are designed to ensure the quality and scalability of our product candidates. We plan to continue to invest in novel methods for process development, manufacturing and formulation for our monoclonal microbials. In the future, we intend to invest in clinical and commercial scale manufacturing. We plan to leverage the efficiency of our integrated capabilities to accelerate the clinical development of product candidates.


• | Strengthen and expand our intellectual property to protect our platform and product candidates. We have exclusive rights to our technologies including issued composition of matter and method of use patents in the United States for our product candidates. We intend to pursue patent protection for our scientific innovations and to maintain a strong and broad estate of patents and trade secrets in the United States and other geographies.


• | Collaborate to realize the potential of SINTAX and monoclonal microbials. We intend to continue to seek collaborations with academic groups, biotech and pharmaceutical companies to realize the value of our broad platform and extend the range of our development activities and disease areas in a timely and cost-effective manner. We plan to commercialize products in multiple geographies both on our own and with collaborators.

The Immune System and the Use of Immunotherapy in Disease
Immunology and Current Immunotherapy
The immune system consists of many different cell types that act together as a coordinated system constantly scanning for, identifying and responding to both human and microbial signals. Immune cells, including different types of T-cells, circulate throughout the body via the lymphatic system searching for signs of disease or infection. When this immune surveillance is functioning correctly, immune cells recognize and destroy both pathogens and cancer cells. However, when the immune system responds excessively, diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis can result. Conversely, an inadequate immune system response may allow various types of cancer and infections to progress unchecked.
Advances in our understanding of how the immune system affects a broad spectrum of disease has resulted in the development of immunotherapies, which are medicines that reduce, suppress, elicit or amplify specific immune responses. Antibody-based immunotherapies for inflammatory diseases and oncology have fundamentally changed the treatment landscape for patients. For example, anti-TNFα antibodies are widely used to treat moderate to severe stages of many inflammatory diseases. In 2018, two of the five top selling drugs worldwide were anti-TNFα antibodies, with HUMIRA alone generating worldwide annual net sales of $19.9 billion. In oncology, checkpoint inhibitor antibodies, including those targeting the programmed cell death protein/ligand 1, or PD-1/PD-L1 pathways, block the tumor’s ability to suppress the immune response. They have improved the treatment of many cancers and are expected as a class to reach peak annual net sales of $30 billion by 2025. While existing immunotherapies have been successful in treating inflammatory diseases and oncology, there remains a substantial unmet need for a majority of patients.
Emergence of a Broad New Opportunity in Immunotherapy
Until recently, immunotherapeutic approaches have largely ignored one of the body’s naturally-evolved routine immunological processes and its associated immune organ—the gut, and specifically the small intestine. Immunomodulation through the small intestine has the potential to address certain limitations of current immunotherapies by acting on multiple naturally evolved and clinically relevant pathways. We believe this novel approach presents advantages, including potentially minimizing adverse events, enhancing patient convenience and targeting multiple immune pathways simultaneously. We believe that a novel class of therapeutics with these attributes has the potential to be transformative in treating a broad range of immune-mediated diseases. Furthermore, we believe this approach could also expand the use of immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with earlier stages of disease.
SINTAX is Central to Human Biology and Immunology
The small intestine is the largest part of the immune system. Specific types of immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, are resident in the tissue of the small intestine. They sample specific contents in the interior of the small intestine, which is called the lumen. These immune cells then migrate to lymph nodes where they condition other important immune cells, including T-cells. These conditioned T-cells then travel throughout the body via the lymphatic system to impact disease. We believe SINTAX provides an opportunity for immunomodulation throughout the body after oral delivery of products that remain physically restricted to the lumen and lymphoid tissues of the gut. Immunomodulation via SINTAX may represent an underappreciated opportunity to drive therapeutically relevant immune responses throughout the body.
SINTAX and Microbes
Microbes in the human gut are single-cell organisms that have co-evolved with the human immune system. Many human immune cells are programmed to sense and respond to microbes that they contact in the small intestine. Research in mucosal immunology has revealed that microbial interactions in the small intestine can drive activity in SINTAX.
Multiple mechanisms for direct interactions between microbes and immune cells in the small intestine have been demonstrated. We believe that dendritic cells and macrophages in the lymphoid tissues of the small intestine are key target cells of immunomodulatory microbes. The small intestine has a large surface area and thin and diffuse mucus layer, which allows for close contact between microbes and immune cells. Dendritic cells are a specialized type of immune cell that survey the body’s tissues, detecting and presenting antigens to T-cells. Macrophages can take on many functional forms depending on the conditioning of their environment in the body and are important for both anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor immunity. Immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, can extend protrusions through junctions between epithelial cells in the lining of the small intestine. These protrusions come into direct contact with and sample the microbial contents of the small intestine lumen. These immune cells then migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes where they come into contact with T-cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages that have been primed by exposure to microbes in the gut, condition T-cells within the mesenteric lymph node and push them towards an inflammatory or immunoregulatory phenotype depending on the specific strain of the microbe. Conditioned T-cells continue to move through the body via the lymphatic system to other parts of the body where they may act in local tissue to modulate an immune response.

The cross-section of the small intestine depicts (1) sampling of microbes in the small intestine by dendritic cells and macrophages, (2) conditioning of T-cells by dendritic cells and macrophages in the lymph node, and (3) migration of conditioned T-cells to other areas of the body.
Several of our academic collaborators have explored the functional consequences of the interactions between immune cells and single strains of microbes in the gut. Veena Taneja, Ph.D. and Joseph Murray M.D. of Mayo Clinic showed that an orally administered strain of Prevotella histicola modulated immune function in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. In the field of immuno-oncology, Thomas Gajewski, M.D., Ph.D. and his group at the University of Chicago conducted an experiment in which a single strain of orally administered Bifidobacterium had equivalent activity to an anti-PD-L1 antibody and additive activity in combination in a mouse model of melanoma. We believe these and other examples from the academic literature support our theory that single strains of microbes can act on SINTAX to suppress or activate immune responses throughout the body. Our Phase 1 clinical data to date also support this theory.
Monoclonal Microbials as a Potential New Class of Oral Biologic Medicines
Our company was founded to discover and develop therapies that act on SINTAX. We aim to develop therapies based on our observations on the central role of the small intestine in modulating immune activity throughout the body and the equally important role of microbes as key modulators of SINTAX.
We have developed the tools to isolate, select, and develop specific microbes that have historically been difficult to identify, isolate and culture. This extends from microbial isolation to monoclonal microbial manufacturing. We have developed proprietary insights and tools that enhance our ability to produce pharmaceutical compositions of monoclonal microbials at scale. This allows us to deliver potentially therapeutic doses of our appropriately formulated strain.
We are developing monoclonal microbials and a reduced form of monoclonal microbials to engage cells in the small intestine and drive changes in systemic biology by either downregulating or upregulating immune responses for the treatment of disease. Monoclonal microbials and a reduced form of monoclonal microbials are orally delivered pharmaceutical compositions of specific strains of microbes derived from a single clone of naturally occurring microbes.
We believe key features and advantages of our monoclonal microbial product candidates are:

• | Single strain. Our product candidates are pharmaceutical compositions of single strains of microbes that we have selected for their specific immunomodulatory properties. We extensively characterize the ability of our product candidates to elicit a desired immunomodulatory effect.


• | Orally administered formulation. We intend to deliver our initial product candidates orally in formulations designed for targeted release of the monoclonal microbials to specific regions within the small intestine. Patients typically prefer oral administration to intravenous infusion, subcutaneous injection, and topical administration, which we believe will facilitate the adoption of our product candidates, if approved.


• | Limited systemic exposure. In preclinical studies, we observed that monoclonal microbials had limited systemic exposure, that they cleared from the gut within 24 to 48 hours and that colonization was not required for beneficial activity. We

4

believe that these factors suggest that monoclonal microbials may have limited systemic off-target side-effects. Our Phase 1b clinical data support this potential.

• | Action on multiple clinically relevant and validated pathways. Our preclinical data have shown that monoclonal microbials may act simultaneously on multiple clinically relevant and validated biological pathways. The diseases we intend to treat are multifactorial, and we believe that our potential therapies will be advantageous over single-target treatments.

Given these expected features, we believe that monoclonal microbial therapies may have a number of advantages in comparison to other immunotherapies such as antibodies, cell therapies and small molecules.
Monoclonal Microbial Platform
We have developed an integrated platform designed to identify individual strains of microbes capable of modulating the immune system by acting on SINTAX when administered at pharmacologically active doses and appropriately formulated. We use the process development and formulation capabilities of our platform to develop selected microbes as product candidates.
Our proprietary monoclonal microbial platform is comprised of the following four key areas:
Candidate discovery. We have assembled a proprietary library of diverse strains of microbes. The continuing accrual of strains in our library is from human mucosal and small intestinal sources in order to benefit from the co-evolution of microbes and the human immune system. We also add to our library through selective licensing agreements and collaborations with academic partners. The proprietary tools within our platform are designed to identify and characterize selected microbes using in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo assays. Proprietary in vitro assays simulate the interactions between microbes and human immune cells, allowing us to evaluate the immunological activity of each microbial strain in relevant experimental systems. Our in vitro assays can screen hundreds of microbes, producing more than 150 data points per strain, including levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This assists our comprehensive selection process to identify candidates for testing in relevant animal models.
Product form. The activity of our monoclonal microbials observed in preclinical studies has been driven by engagement with and modification of immune cells in the small intestine. This activity has not been reliant on engraftment (or colonization) as we have observed that our monoclonal microbials passed through the gut and did not distribute around the body or engraft in the gut. Furthermore, this preclinical activity was observed to be independent of the ability of our monoclonal microbials to replicate. From this observation, we believe that monoclonal microbial activity is likely driven by recognition of structural motifs by immune cells in the small intestine. Our candidate selection process may include an additional manufacturing step for our monoclonal microbial candidates to develop them as non-replicating product candidates, such as EDP1867. We are also researching the potential of reduced forms of our monoclonal microbials to target SINTAX. Preclinical studies suggest that this approach may further improve potency and activity and we are currently advancing EDP2939, our first product candidate based on a reduced form of monoclonal microbials, through preclinical development.
Formulation. Our first clinical product candidates are formulated as capsules containing lyophilized powder for targeted release in the small intestine. We intend to continuously invest in formulation to improve the delivery of our product candidates and enhance their ability to target and act on SINTAX.    
Process development and manufacturing. Process development and manufacturing are critical for the translation of monoclonal microbials into therapies. Our expertise and investments in pilot scale manufacturing have allowed us to mitigate challenges inherent to monoclonal microbial manufacturing at clinical scale. Major challenges include limited understanding and characterization of applicable microbes; strict anaerobic growth conditions required by certain microbes, many of which have never before been fermented; and temperature and oxygen sensitivities that affect downstream processing. We believe that our approach to these challenges may enable us to accelerate the process from strain identification to clinical supply.
5

Process development is integrated into our research activities, combining discovery and downstream development. We believe we have achieved control of quality, identity, purity, and potency throughout the process of strain selection, fermentation, formulation, and pharmacology, with high yield. Importantly, we believe our manufacturing processes enable us to produce a drug substance that is pharmacologically active in the form of a lyophilized powder, which is suitable for production in accordance with the FDA good manufacturing practice ("cGMP") regulations. For each of our clinical product candidates, we have observed therapeutic activity in lyophilized powder form in relevant preclinical mouse models.
We have been able to manufacture monoclonal microbials in a relatively short timeframe compared to other biologic therapies, which we believe may accelerate our speed into the clinic. Additionally, we believe that we may be able to cost-effectively manufacture monoclonal microbials.
Product Development Strategy and Portfolio
We are advancing monoclonal microbials to potentially treat a spectrum of immune-mediated diseases with an initial focus on inflammatory diseases and oncology. We expect our initial clinical trials for our product candidates to provide information on safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic responses and biomarkers of immune response in multiple indications with different pathologies and sites of disease. This may allow for expansion into a broad range of clinical indications, which could enable us to capture the breadth of clinical value.
Beyond our first wave of product candidates in inflammatory diseases and oncology, we are continuing to invest in the discovery of new candidates to build a deep pipeline across a wide range of diseases and tissue types to leverage the broad potential of our platform. We also intend to opportunistically collaborate to expand indications and accelerate development of programs where collaborators can contribute further disease-specific expertise to our platform.
Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our current product candidates are illustrated below.
Notes:
(1) We intend to evaluate EDP1815 in additional indications pending the results of interim data from the planned EDP1815 Phase 2 clinical trial. Potential indications include psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
(2) The Phase 1/2 study of EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA is being conducted in a clinical collaboration with Merck.
Inflammatory Diseases Portfolio
We have three candidates in development for inflammatory diseases. EDP1815 is a monoclonal microbial currently in Phase 1b development and is expected to enter a Phase 2 trial in the second quarter of 2020. In December 2018, we nominated EDP1867, a non-replicating monoclonal microbial candidate for inflammatory diseases, which we expect to advance into a Phase 1b asthma study in the second half of 2020. In December 2019, we nominated EDP2939 as a candidate for inflammatory disease. EDP2939 is our first product candidate based on a reduced form of monoclonal microbials. In February 2020, we discontinued development of EDP1066.

EDP1815
EDP1815 is a monoclonal microbial candidate for inflammatory diseases. In November 2018 we initiated our ongoing Phase 1b placebo-controlled dose-escalating safety and tolerability study of EDP1815 in 24 healthy volunteers and up to 108 individuals with mild to moderate psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. The primary endpoint of this trial is safety and tolerability. Prospectively defined secondary and exploratory endpoints include clinical measures of disease, cellular histological biomarkers and blood immune cell biomarkers taken from biopsies and blood samples, respectively, at the start and end of the 28-day dosing period. Safety and tolerability, and secondary clinical endpoints are also measured at day 42, two weeks after completion of dosing.
In August 2019, we reported positive interim data from this Phase 1b trial from an initial cohort of 12 individuals with mild to moderate psoriasis dosed once per day for 28 days with 550mg (low dose) of the enteric capsule formulation of EDP1815 or placebo. EDP1815 was well tolerated in this cohort with no overall difference reported from placebo.
At the end of the 28-day dosing period, individuals dosed with EDP1815 showed a reduction in mean LSS at 28 days of 2 points (p<0.05), compared to a mean increase of 0.25 points in individuals who received placebo. LSS reductions over the dosing period of individuals dosed with EDP1815 ranged from 0-67 percent. LSS, a secondary endpoint, is a component of the PASI score and measures redness, thickness, and scaling of an individual psoriatic lesion and is a sensitive clinical measure for individuals with mild to moderate disease. Trends consistent with the LSS reductions were observed in the reduction of the PASI scores in individuals treated with EDP1815 compared to individuals treated with placebo.
In November 2019, we reported additional positive interim clinical data from this ongoing Phase 1b trial in a cohort of 18 individuals with mild to moderate psoriasis who were randomized 2:1 to receive a daily dose of 2.76g (high dose) of the enteric capsule formulation of EDP1815 or placebo for 28 days.
EDP1815 continued to be well tolerated in this cohort, with no overall difference reported from placebo. At the end of the 28-day dosing period, the high dose cohort showed a mean reduction in LSS consistent with previously reported data from the low dose cohort.
Two weeks following the completion of the dosing period, at day 42, the high dose cohort showed continued reductions from baseline in both mean LSS and PASI, which may be indicative of sustained clinical activity and dose response.
A summary of the LSS and PASI results are shown in the tables below.
Mean (+/-SE) Percentage Change in LSS vs. Start of Dosing Period (1)

 | n | At end of 28-daydosing period | At day 42 
Placebo (2) | 10 | 0.6% (9.0%) | -7.2% (6.2%) 
EDP1815 (high dose) | 12 | -15.1% (6.4%) | -24.1% (7.1%)
EDP1815 (low dose) | 8 | -22.8% (9.9%) | -9.0% (12.7%)

Mean (+/-SE) Percentage Change in PASI vs. Start of Dosing Period (1)

 | n | At end of 28-daydosing period | At day 42 
Placebo (2) | 10 | -1.0% (13.2%) | -3.3% (14.8%)
EDP1815 (high dose) | 12 | -16.0% (8.1%) | -20.7% (8.2%)
EDP1815 (low dose) | 8 | -16.0% (8.3%) | -9.7% (11.3%)

Notes:
(1) This study was not powered to detect statistically significant differences in clinical effect between treatment groups.
(2) Represents the combination of placebo arms from the low dose (n=4) and high dose (n=6) cohorts.
A range of histological and molecular biomarkers were measured in the low dose and high dose cohort, with trends in line with the clinical activity of EDP1815 observed in the low dose cohort.
We expect to report additional data from the Phase 1b trial in a cohort of up to 24 individuals with psoriasis to be dosed with the new formulation of EDP1815. Data from this cohort will be available in the second quarter of 2020. We also expect to report data from a cohort of up to 24 subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis dosed with the new formulation of EDP1815 in the second quarter of 2020.
7

Based on feedback from the FDA and the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the "MHRA") we plan to advance EDP1815 into a Phase 2 dose ranging study, evaluating three doses of a new formulation of EDP1815 versus placebo in approximately 180 individuals. The primary endpoint of the study will be the mean reduction in PASI score at 16 weeks. Other clinical measures of psoriasis will also be evaluated. We expect to initiate the Phase 2 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2020, and to announce interim data by the end of 2020. Clinical data from this study may enable us to advance directly into Phase 3 registrational studies in 2021, subject to end of Phase 2 discussions with regulatory agencies.
We intend to evaluate EDP1815 in further inflammatory disease indications, depending on the results from a planned interim data analysis from the Phase 2 trial. Potential indications include psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. We also expect to continue to conduct immuno-pharmacology clinical trials in healthy volunteers with EDP1815.
EDP1867
EDP1867 is a non-replicating monoclonal microbial candidate for inflammatory diseases. EDP1867 was selected from a broad screen of single strains of microbes in in vitro cellular assays and in vivo models of inflammation.
In preclinical studies EDP1867 was shown to resolve TH2-dependent inflammation which underlies atopic diseases and a large spectrum of asthma. We expect to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial in individuals with asthma in the second half of 2020.
EDP1066
EDP1066 is a monoclonal microbial candidate for inflammatory diseases. In April 2018 we initiated a Phase 1b placebo-controlled dose-escalating safety and tolerability study of EDP1066 in 36 healthy volunteers and up to 96 subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis or atopic dermatitis which is now complete. EDP1066 was well tolerated with no overall difference reported from placebo in both mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and mild to moderate psoriasis. 
We observed changes in biomarkers of inflammation, an exploratory endpoint, consistent with a pharmacodynamic effect in a cohort of individuals with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis treated with a high dose of the new formulation of EDP1066 which were greater than those previously observed in a cohort of individuals with mild-to-moderate psoriasis treated with a high dose of the original formulation of EDP1066. No effects were observed in either cohort in the secondary endpoints of clinical measures of disease. Based on this data, we have decided to discontinue development of EDP1066.
Inflammation Preclinical Data
Each of our inflammatory disease monoclonal microbial candidates have demonstrated the ability to simultaneously impact multiple pathways and associated cytokines in preclinical assays, suggesting that they may have broader applicability than individual cytokine-directed therapies. In addition, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-27 can inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Certain of our product candidates induced increased production of IL-10 and IL-27 in preclinical assays.
Inflammation Development Strategy
We selected mild-to-moderate psoriasis and atopic dermatitis as indications for first-in-human studies based upon our preclinical data, need in large patient populations, the ease of access to patient tissue for biomarker analysis and the speed of clinical data readout. Patients with mild-to-moderate disease represent between 80% and 90% of the patient population, which is estimated to represent more than 25 million people in the United States. We believe these patients are underserved by current treatments, including steroids, which either inadequately control inflammation or are not safe for long-term use. The majority of novel therapies, including next generation biologics targeting IL-17, IL-23 or IL4RA, two anti-inflammatory cytokines and a cytokine receptor, are only approved for patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Even in the moderate to severe setting, a large proportion of eligible patients do not receive biologics, instead opting for topicals or oral systemic therapies. These factors suggest a need for a novel therapeutic option that is well tolerated, effective and convenient.
If our product candidates demonstrate safety and tolerability and limited adverse events in clinical trials, they could open up a larger market than the one currently treated by biologics. If proof-of-concept in mild-to-moderate patients is established, we also intend to broaden our studies to treat patients with moderate-to-severe inflammation, potentially expanding this market opportunity further.
In preclinical mouse models, our inflammatory disease product candidates reduced systemic inflammation with equal or better activity than current standard of care therapies. We believe that this observation may translate to broad activity across a variety of inflammatory diseases. We have produced preclinical data in distinct mouse models that are representative of different biologies, suggesting that single monoclonal microbials may impact multiple immune pathways.
T-cells of the Th1 or Th17 type are implicated in psoriasis, joint inflammatory diseases and neuroinflammation, while T-cells of the Th2 type are more important for atopies and allergic diseases. With current cytokine-directed therapies, agents are targeted towards a specific cytokine to influence one or more of these pathways. For instance, Th1-driven inflammation can be 
8

controlled by TNFa or IL-6 inhibition, Th17-driven inflammation can be controlled by IL-17 or IL-23 inhibition, and Th-2 driven inflammation can be controlled by IL-4 or IL-13 inhibition.
Oncology Portfolio
We have advanced monoclonal microbial candidate, EDP1503, into two clinical trials in individuals with multiple cancer types.
EDP1503
In December 2018, we initiated our ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label study of EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, in three cohorts of individuals: microsatellite stable colorectal cancer; triple-negative breast cancer; and individuals with multiple tumor types who have relapsed on prior PD-1/L1 inhibitor treatment. We plan to enroll up to 120 subjects in this study which is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, immune response markers and overall response rates achieved with EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA.
In November 2019, we announced that the microsatellite stable colorectal cancer cohort has been fully recruited. Several individuals in this cohort have shown extended stable disease although no formal clinical responses have been evident. Cellular infiltration biomarker changes were also observed in tumor biopsies taken from these individuals during the EDP1503 monotherapy period, which we believe are consistent with preclinical observations for EDP1503. We continue to monitor individuals in this cohort.
Given newly approved treatments for triple-negative breast cancer, we anticipate that the majority of individuals with triple negative breast cancer to be recruited will have relapsed following prior PD-1/L1 therapy, similar to those in the PD-1 relapsed cohort. We expect to report further clinical data from this trial in the first half of 2020.
In January 2019, the University of Chicago initiated a Phase 2a investigator-sponsored clinical study of EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA in individuals with melanoma. The University of Chicago plans to enroll up to 70 individuals who are PD-1-naïve and PD-1-relapsed melanoma in this study which is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and overall response rates achieved with EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA. Additionally, the University of Chicago will evaluate immune response markers from biopsies taken during the study. We are not issuing guidance related to this investigator-sponsored trial.
Oncology Preclinical Data
Preclinical data suggests that EDP1503 is active through different immune mechanisms beyond those targeted by checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 inhibitors. Research suggests that checkpoint inhibition prevents the downregulation of the immune system induced by tumors. In preclinical models, we observed that EDP1503 stimulated upregulation of the immune response to tumors. Oral administration of EDP1503 in preclinical mouse models appeared to delay tumor progression to a similar extent as checkpoint inhibitors using different immune mechanisms. In mouse models, EDP1503 had additive effects when combined with a checkpoint inhibitor.
We believe that our existing and potential monoclonal microbial product candidates have the potential to broaden the base of cancer immunotherapy. EDP1503 preclinical data suggests a variety of effects in mouse tumor models, including upregulation of CD8+ T-cell infiltration, increased intratumoral pro-inflammatory chemokines, upregulation of MHC Class I expression and augmentation of NK cell infiltration. We believe that the ability of a monoclonal microbial to induce these effects across multiple pathways makes it an attractive combination candidate for checkpoint inhibitors relative to other immunotherapies in development that target a single pathway.
Manufacturing
We have developed proprietary methods for the manufacture of pharmacologically active monoclonal microbials and reduced forms of monoclonal microbials that are scalable and transferable to cGMP manufacturing facilities. Monoclonal microbials are isolated, proliferated and purified in a manner analogous to the manufacture of pharmaceutical drugs. Monoclonal microbials and reduced forms of monoclonal microbials maintain their therapeutic effect through the manufacturing process, which produces drug substance in a powder form that makes our candidates suitable for oral administration, for instance in the form of a capsule, tablet or powder. Additionally, we believe we have established robust analytical methods to assess the identity, strength and purity of monoclonal microbials. We expect that these controlled manufacturing processes and analytical methods will allow us to produce and release cGMP batches of material with consistent quality.
Our internal manufacturing capabilities include production of non-GMP materials for in vitro and in vivo preclinical assessment of product candidates. We currently use third-party manufacturers for the production of materials for clinical studies. Our internal personnel have cGMP manufacturing experience to ensure efficient technology transfer and oversee the development and manufacturing activities conducted by third-party manufacturers. Our agreements with third-party manufacturers include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights to our monoclonal microbial candidates.

We expect our third-party manufacturers to meet manufacturing requirements and drug supply required by our clinical studies. In some instances, we have reserved resources from third-party manufacturers for the development and manufacture of our monoclonal microbial candidates for near-term clinical programs. We believe that these relationships are integral to ensuring reliable, high-quality drug supply for clinical development.
While we do not have a current need for commercial manufacturing capacity, we intend to evaluate both building internal capabilities and contracting with third-party manufacturers at the appropriate time.
Process development and manufacturing are critical for the development of monoclonal microbials and reduced forms of monoclonal microbials. We believe our internal expertise and external partnerships have allowed us to address unique challenges associated with monoclonal microbial manufacturing. Some of these major challenges include limited prior know-how in the field for novel microbes, strict anaerobic growth conditions required by many commensal microbes and temperature and oxygen sensitivities that affect downstream processing.
Our proprietary methods for the manufacture of pharmacologically active monoclonal microbials address these three challenges. Many human commensals are strict anaerobes with no development precedent. Process development of commensal microbes requires strong technical expertise in microbiology and anaerobic fermentation. We are pioneering strict anaerobic bioprocessing technologies that can allow for rapid development of reproducible manufacturing processes. We continue to optimize processes across a wide range of parameters including media, temperature, pH, and harvest conditions. 
Our monoclonal microbial manufacturing processes consist of drug substance and drug product manufacturing. We have established expertise across all aspects of drug substance manufacturing operations including cell banking, fermentation, cell separation and lyophilization. We have also advanced knowledge related to drug product manufacturing and our drug product has demonstrated stability under long-term storage conditions. We will continue to advance novel formulation technologies for enhanced delivery and activity in future trials.
Sales and Marketing
Given the current developmental stage of our product candidates and platform, we have not yet established a commercial organization. We intend to commercialize our products globally and in multiple disease areas. We intend to do this both through selectively building our own sales and marketing team and partnering or collaborating with third parties.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover both our broad platform and individual product candidates. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treatment, methods of manufacture, and methods for patient selection created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates, as well as discoveries based on our proprietary platforms. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce any patents that we may obtain, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position and, in the future, may rely on or leverage in-licensing opportunities.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent may be challenged in courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or at all, whether the claims of any patent applications, should they issue, will cover our product candidates, or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors or otherwise provide any competitive advantage, or, if challenged, in courts or administrative proceedings, be determined to be invalid or unenforceable.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries and patent application filings, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Accordingly, we may not have been the first to invent the subject matter disclosed in some of our patent applications or the first to file patent applications covering such subject matter, and we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "USPTO") to determine priority of invention.

Patent Portfolio
Our patent portfolio includes patent applications in varying stages of prosecution in the United States and selected jurisdictions outside of the United States. As of February 12, 2020, our patent portfolio consisted of nine issued patents and 41 patent families, which include composition, method of use, and manufacturing process claims. Additionally, a Notice of Allowance has been received for one application in the United States. Of the patents in our portfolio, three are owned by us, five are exclusively licensed from the Mayo Clinic Foundation for Medical Education and Research, an affiliate of Mayo Clinic, (the "Mayo Clinic") and one is exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago. Of the patent families in our portfolio, 39 are owned by us, one is exclusively licensed to us from the University of Chicago and one is exclusively licensed to us from the Mayo Clinic. The patent portfolio includes patents and applications covering the following:

• | An oral oncology platform exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago, consisting of one issued patent and 24 pending applications. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2036.


• | Formulation platforms in which applications that issue as a patent are expected to expire in 2038 to 2040.


• | Modality platforms in which applications that issue as a patent are expected to expire in 2038 to 2040.


• | Inflammation portfolio:


• | EDP1815, consisting of five issued patents in-licensed from the Mayo Clinic, covering compositions and methods of use (the patents and application from the Mayo Clinic expected to expire in 2030) and four patent families we own directed to compositions, methods of use and manufacturing processes. Any applications claiming priority to these applications we own that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2038 to 2040;


• | EDP1867, consisting of two patent families we own directed to compositions and methods of use. Any applications claiming priority to these applications that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2039 and 2041; and


• | EDP2939, consisting of one patent family we own directed to compositions and methods of use. Any applications claiming priority to these applications that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2038.


• | Oncology portfolio:


• | EDP1503 includes protection under the oral oncology platform exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago covering methods of use. Applications in this family that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2036. Patent protection for EDP1503 is also being pursued in two patent families we own directed to compositions and methods of use. Any applications we own claiming priority to these applications that issue as patents are expected to expire in 2038 to 2040. 

Patent Term
The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of such an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or fourteen years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug, and a patent cannot be extended more than once or for more than a single product. During the period of extension, if granted, the scope of exclusivity is limited to the approved product for approved uses. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply, if appropriate, for patent term extension on patents covering those product candidates, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture.
Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities’ relationship with us must be 
11

kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
License and Manufacturing Agreements 
We are a party to several license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. The licensed intellectual property includes composition of matter and methods of using monoclonal microbials. In some cases, licenses cover physical material in the form of microbial strains. Certain diligence and financial obligations are tied to these agreements. Additionally, we are a party to manufacturing agreements for committed resources and exclusivity. We consider the following agreements to be material to our business.
University of Chicago License Agreement
In March 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Chicago. This agreement gives us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to patent rights related to administration of microbes to treat cancer. Under this agreement, we may make, have made, use, import, have sold, offer to sell, and sell microbial products to treat cancer in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Many microbial genera are covered by these patent rights, including Bifidobacterium, which encompasses our lead oncology candidate, EDP1503. In addition, we have a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use technical information disclosed to us by the University of Chicago for the development and commercialization of microbial products to treat cancer in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Under this agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and market licensed products. Commercially reasonable efforts can be demonstrated by achieving specific milestones by specific dates.
Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we paid the University of Chicago an upfront fee of an amount less than $0.5 million and are required to make low five-digit license maintenance fees on an annual basis, creditable against royalties owed in that given year. In addition, we may owe the University of Chicago future milestone payments totaling an aggregate of approximately $60.9 million upon achievement of specific milestones, the vast majority of which are associated with specific regulatory and commercial milestones.
The University of Chicago is entitled to receive low single-digit percentage royalties on annual net sales of products that fall under the licensed patent rights on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. The royalty percentage depends on the amount of annual net sales and whether the product is covered by valid patent claims, un-published technical information, or published technical information. Our valid claims royalty obligations to the University of Chicago will expire upon the later of (a) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim covering the product, or (b) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity of a product covered by the patent rights. Technical information royalty obligations will expire upon the earlier of (a) fifteen years from first commercial sale of the applicable product, or (b) when a substantially similar product comes onto the market.
Under the license agreement, we have the right to sublicense licensed rights to third parties, provided that the sublicense agreement is consistent with the terms of the original license and that we hold any sublicensees compliant. Should we enter a sublicense under these patent rights, we are required to pay the University of Chicago a percentage of our sublicense revenue. The University of Chicago is entitled to percentages of sublicense revenue in the low- to mid-teens depending on the stage of development of licensed products at the time the sublicense is entered.
The University of Chicago maintains control of patent prosecution, defense and maintenance on their patent rights. We are responsible for reimbursing the University of Chicago for patent costs incurred. If we cease payment for patent prosecution, our patent rights will terminate and revert to the University of Chicago. We have the first right, but not obligation, to control any post grant proceedings and to take action in the prosecution or prevention of any infringement by a third party to patent rights.
The license granted by the University of Chicago is subject to any retained rights of the U.S. government in the patent rights and to retained rights of the University of Chicago to use the patent rights for non-commercial research purposes. The license agreement will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of (a) expiration date of the last to expire licensed patents, or (b) a set number of years in the mid-teens from first commercial sale of a licensed product. Prior to the expiration date, we may terminate the license with written notification to the University of Chicago. Prior to the expiration date, the University of Chicago may terminate the agreement in whole or in part if we fail to make payments within thirty days of receiving a written notice of missed payment, if we breach any material obligation of the agreement and do not cure such breach within thirty days, if we become bankrupt or insolvent, or if we are dissolved or liquidated. The University of Chicago may also terminate the license if we fail to show commercially reasonable efforts in meeting diligence milestones.

License Agreement with the Mayo Clinic
In August 2017, we entered into an agreement with the Mayo Clinic to license intellectual property and microbial strains. This agreement gives us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to patent rights related to compositions of matter and methods of using microbes from a specific species to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In addition to patent rights, this agreement also includes an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to an immuno-modulatory microbial strain isolated from a human small intestinal sample by the Mayo Clinic. Under the licensed patent rights and/or using the licensed microbial strain, we may make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, and import products containing microbes of a specific species to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In addition, we have a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use know-how disclosed to us by the Mayo Clinic related to the development and commercialization of products containing microbes of a specific species to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The licensed patents include five issued U.S. patents. Issued claims cover compositions containing microbes from a specified species and methods of using these compositions to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. EDP1815, one of our lead candidates in the inflammation program, contains the microbial strain licensed from the Mayo Clinic and is covered by these patent rights. Under this agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to bring licensed products to the market.
In consideration for the licenses, we paid the Mayo Clinic an upfront payment of $0.2 million. Beginning on the second anniversary of the effective date, we owe the Mayo Clinic escalating annual license maintenance fees in the low- to mid-five digits. Annual license maintenance fees count towards milestones and royalties owed in a given year. The Mayo Clinic is entitled to future clinical, approval and sales milestones. In addition, we have agreed to pay the Mayo Clinic future milestone payments totaling a maximum of $1.0 million upon achievement of specific development milestones and $56 million upon achievement of specific regulatory and commercial milestones.
The Mayo Clinic is entitled to receive low single-digit percentage royalties on annual net sales of products that fall under the licensed patent rights or contain the licensed microbial strain on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. The royalty percentage depends on the amount of annual net sales and whether the product is covered by valid patent claims or contains the licensed microbial strain. Royalties on products containing the licensed microbial strain will only be due in countries where licensed products are not covered by valid claims. Our valid claims royalty obligations to the Mayo Clinic will terminate on expiration of the last to expire valid claim covering the product. Royalty obligations on products containing the licensed microbial strain will expire 15 years from the first commercial sale of the licensed product.
Under the license agreement, we have the right to sublicense licensed patent rights and the licensed microbial strain to third parties through multiple tiers, provided that the sublicense agreement is on substantially the same terms as the original license and that we are responsible for the performance of sublicensees. We must obtain the Mayo Clinic’s permission to grant any fully paid-up, royalty-free or exclusive sublicenses. We have no financial obligations to the Mayo Clinic related to sublicenses.
The Mayo Clinic has the responsibility to prepare, file, prosecute or abandon its patent rights. We may provide prior comment and advice to the Mayo Clinic and we are responsible for reimbursing the Mayo Clinic for past and future patent costs. If we cease payment for patent preparation, filing or prosecution, our patent rights will terminate and revert to the Mayo Clinic. We have the first right, but not obligation, to control any post grant proceedings and to take action in the prosecution or prevention of any infringement by a third party to patent rights.
The license granted by Mayo Clinic is subject to any retained rights of the US government in the patent rights and to retained rights of Mayo Clinic to use the patent rights and licensed microbial strain for non-commercial research purposes, which excludes human use. The license to patent rights will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the expiration date of the last to expire licensed patents. The license to Mayo Clinic’s microbial strain will expire 15 years from first commercial sale of a product containing the licensed microbial strain. Prior to the expiration date, Mayo Clinic may terminate the license if we fail to make payments within thirty days of receiving a written notice of missed payment, if we breach any material obligation of the agreement and do not cure such breach within thirty days, if we become bankrupt or insolvent, or if we or any sublicensee directly or indirectly brings suit against Mayo Clinic. Upon early termination of our license, any sublicensee that is not in material breach of the agreement will have the right to retain its sublicense to the patent rights and microbial strain. We do not have the right to terminate the agreement prior to the expiration date.
Biose Committed Resource and Exclusivity Agreement
Effective February 2018, we entered into an exclusivity and commitment agreement with Biose Industrie ("Biose"). Under this agreement, Biose reserves sufficient manufacturing resources for the manufacture of our drug substance according to a specified schedule of manufacturing runs over a three-year period. We are required to pay Biose fees in the high five digits to low six digits for each run depending on the type of run being conducted. If we do not use committed manufacturing resources, we are required to pay Biose for these resources unless Biose is able to re-sell unused runs.
13

In addition to manufacturing resources, this agreement includes exclusivity provisions, which ensure that we are Biose’s exclusive customer for the manufacture of certain microbial biotherapeutic products. We are required to pay annual fees in the mid six digits to Biose in consideration for these exclusivity provisions.
The term of the agreement is three years from the effective date. We may terminate the agreement at any time with prior notice within a specified period to Biose, or if there is a change of control of Biose that may adversely affect our interest. In the event that we terminate at will, we are obligated to pay Biose a mid-range percentage of the committed manufacturing resource fees for a specified period less than one year following the effective date of termination. In addition, both parties may terminate if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified period or if either party becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or is dissolved or liquidated.
Sacco Collaboration Agreement
In July 2019, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Sacco S.r.l. ("Sacco"), an affiliate of one of our contract manufacturing organizations. Pursuant to the agreement, Sacco has agreed that it and its affiliates will, on an exclusive and worldwide basis for and on behalf of us, manufacture and supply single strain, non-genetically modified microbes intended for oral delivery or oral use in pharmaceutical products for a period of five years. Sacco and its affiliates may not manufacture and supply single strain, non-genetically modified microbes for oral delivery or oral use in pharmaceutical products for itself or other parties, with the exception of pre-existing products for pre-existing customers. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to pay annual fees in the mid six digits to Sacco during the exclusivity period. 
The agreement will remain in effect during the exclusivity period and may be terminated by (i) us upon written notice to Sacco if an independent third-party representative concludes following an audit that Sacco or its affiliates are not in compliance with the exclusivity provisions of the agreement, (ii) Sacco upon written notice to us if the manufacturing relationship has been inactive for a period of six consecutive months and there are no services scheduled to be performed or products scheduled to be supplied within the next six months, or (iii) either party in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party that remains uncured for 20 business days or the insolvency of the other party.
Collaboration
Merck-MSD International GmbH
In November 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Merck under which we will sponsor and conduct a clinical trial evaluating EDP1503 in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal carcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and checkpoint inhibitor relapsed tumors. Under the agreement, we retain sole ownership of all rights to EDP1503, and there are no material financial terms or commitments required of either party. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid growth and a dynamic landscape of proprietary therapeutic candidates. While we believe that our monoclonal microbial platform and candidates, coupled with our resources and industry expertise, give us a competitive advantage in the field, we face competition from a variety of institutions, including larger pharmaceutical companies with more resources. Specialty biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies, as well as public and private institutions are also potential sources of competitive products and technologies.
In both inflammatory diseases and oncology, we anticipate intensifying competition as new therapies are approved and advanced technologies become available. Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have considerably greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Competitors may also have more experience developing, obtaining approval for, and marketing novel treatments in the indications we are pursuing. These factors could give our competitors an advantage over us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, completing clinical development, and commercializing their products. Competitors that are able to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can for our products may also establish a stronger market position, diminishing our commercial opportunity. Key considerations that would impact our capacity to effectively compete include the efficacy, safety, ease of use, as well as pricing and reimbursement of our products.
In autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, we may be challenged by a wide range of competitors. In later, more severe stages of disease, the majority of competition will stem from companies marketing or developing injectable biologics and novel small molecule therapies, such as AbbVie Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc, Novartis International A.G., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Sanofi S.A., Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Amgen Inc. Potentially competing mechanisms of action include TNF, IL-4, IL-17, IL-23,JAK, and PDE4 inhibitors. Novel delivery of biologics, particularly via oral administration, and the entry of biosimilars will also add to competition within the therapeutic area.
Significant competition exists in the immuno-oncology field, where we are developing our first product candidates in oncology. Although our monoclonal microbial approach is unique from most other existing or investigational therapies in immuno-
14

oncology, we will need to compete with all currently or imminently available therapies within the indications where our development is focused. Although there is a wide range of potentially competitive mechanisms, possible synergies between these and monoclonal microbials will also be evaluated.
The main classes of immunotherapy that are available or are being evaluated by our competitors include:

• | Checkpoint inhibitors: Agenus Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb, F. Hoffmann-La Roche A.G., Merck, Pfizer Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.; and


• | Cell therapy: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Inc., and Novartis International A.G.

Government Regulation
Government Regulation in the United States
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval for our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a biologics license application ("BLA") and licensure, which constitutes approval, by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. None of our product candidates has been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States, and we currently have no BLAs pending. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during product development, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before our biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice ("GLP") requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application ("IND") which must become effective before clinical trials in the United States may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication, conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice ("GCP") requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
15

Preclinical and Clinical Trials
Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which must be conducted in accordance with GLP requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent institutional review board ("IRB") for each investigator site proposing to participate in a clinical trial must also review and approve the clinical trial before it can begin at that site, and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including requirements for informed consent.
For purposes of BLA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.

• | Phase 1-Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.


• | Phase 2-Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.


• | Phase 3-Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.

In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
Although most clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA, under the IND regulations and procedures described above, there are certain circumstances under which clinical trials can be conducted without submission of an IND. For example, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the biologic in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
16

BLA Submission and FDA Review
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the biologic, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee unless a waiver is granted, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. Each BLA submitted to the FDA is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days of the FDA’s receipt of the application. If the BLA is found to be complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full substantive review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission.
Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to review the application and respond to the applicant. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of reviewing BLAs within ten months of the 60-day filing date for standard review or six months for priority review, but the overall timeframe is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the biological product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility or facilities in which it is manufactured meet standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured, and will not license the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance with GCP requirements, and will not license the biologic unless compliance with such requirements is satisfactory.
The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than sponsors. Once the FDA approves a BLA, such approval defines the indicated uses for which the biologic may be marketed. The FDA may also require implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which can include a medication guide, communication plan, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, physician training, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling claims or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing based on the results of these post-marketing studies. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
A new drug or biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor meetings with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. In addition, a new drug or biologic may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited 
17

development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Additionally, products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or review process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-Approval Requirements
Licensed biologics that are manufactured or distributed in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record keeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our contract manufacturers pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.

Biosimilars and Regulatory Exclusivity
As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the "ACA", the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the "BPCIA") established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The abbreviated regulatory pathway provides legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics based on their similarity to an existing brand product, referred to as a reference product, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable with a brand product. Under the BPCIA the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for a reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological drug products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. In addition, the period of exclusivity provided by the BPCIA only operates against third parties seeking approval via the abbreviated pathway, but would not prevent third parties from pursuing approval via the traditional approval pathway. In addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products. For example, biological products in the European Union may be eligible for at least a ten-year period of exclusivity.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of drugs and biologics. For instance, in the European Economic Area (the "EEA") (comprised of the 27 European Union Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either a centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure-Under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"), the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application (the "MAA") by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops.
National authorization procedures-There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.

In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the European Union until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the European Union. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
19

The criteria for designating an "orphan medicinal product" in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EEA a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no marketing authorization application shall be accepted and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. The ten year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice and the related national implementing provisions of the individual European Union Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the European Union Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier, or the Common Technical Document, with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual European Union Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, or Clinical Trials Regulation, was adopted. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all the European Union Member States, and supersedes the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable, the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the "European Union portal"; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all European Union Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned European Union Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, the U.S. federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations as well as similar state and foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors and governments provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products.
20

In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Furthermore, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. By way of example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how these decisions, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2029 absent additional congressional action. 
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, 
21

among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
Research and Development
We have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to our efforts to develop our product candidates.  We incurred research and development expenses of $63.1 million, $39.9 million, and $20.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development in 2020 as we continue to advance our product candidates through clinical development.
Employees
As of February 7, 2020, we have 98 full-time employees, including 39 with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of those full-time employees, 73 are engaged in research and development. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
