ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Overview
 
The Company designs and manufactures commercial LED lighting. Intellitronix Corporation (“Intellitronix”), our wholly owned subsidiary, is a manufacturer of automotive aftermarket and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) electronics.
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Florida on October 17, 2003, under the corporate name Luxurious Travel Corp., in order to develop, market and distribute a hotel booking engine software that interfaces and captures various rate channels and inventory controls for hotel reservations. The system allowed users to market, manage and sell hotel reservations, and to produce invoices, track follow up and manage customer relationships.
 
The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of US Lighting Group, Inc. (founded in 2013 in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming) on July 13, 2016, and the corporate name was changed on August 9, 2016 to the US Lighting Group, Inc.
 
Intellitronix Corp. was acquired by the Company on December 1, 2016. The Company agreed to pay $4.0 million in exchange for all the shares of Intellitronix Corp. Intellitronix Corp. is a designer and a US-based manufacturer of automotive electronic products such as digital and analog gauges, energy management systems and ignition boxes. The products are sold through aftermarket distributors, as well consumer direct and through some OEM channels. At the time of acquisition Intellitronix Corp. already had access to the automotive electronics market and had an established distributor and consumer base.


As a consolidated entity, the Company has demonstrated revenue growth; however, the Company has historically reported operating losses primarily from expenses associated with public company costs, corporate marketing, and product development activities. However, in the year ending December 31, 2020, the Company was able to report net income due to a significant increase in sales by Intellitronix and an increase in its manufacturing productivity due to automation. We intend to raise capital to operate and expand our business to meet the growing demand for our products. We plan to grow revenue through the increase in sale of our existing products and our new products via our existing distribution networks, as well as, completing more OEM projects for the recreational vehicle (RV) and marine industries.
 
US Lighting Group
 
In recent years, we have seen a more energy-efficient, environmentally safe, and flexible lighting for businesses and residential homes. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) offer numerous advantages over traditional light bulbs. LEDs are more durable resembling a hard plastic versus a thin glass. Since mercury is not required in the manufacturing process, LEDs are more environmentally friendly. Benefits of using our LED lights include an immediate and significant reduction in lighting bills with no yearly bulb or ballast replacements. LED lights are durable and rugged, resistant to external impacts, and emit virtually no heat and ultraviolet emissions. Furthermore, unlike the previous fluorescent bulb, LED lights are ecologically friendly as they do not include mercury or hazardous chemical and are recyclable.
 
Applications for our LED lights include commercial spaces such as board rooms, offices, factories, stores, gymnasiums, schools, hospitals, warehouses, and greenhouses, as well as some residential applications such as garages.
 
LEDs are a cost-effective, energy-savings alternative to incandescent lights, touting a 2000% efficiency rate over conventional light bulbs and a 500% efficiency rate over compact fluorescent bulbs. Over a 10-year period, the lighting industry could save $1 trillion in energy costs, eliminate the need for nearly 1 billion barrels of petroleum leading to a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. With technology advancements, the true potential of LED lighting lies in their ability to transform lighting technology. The light spectrum could be custom-tailored for all wavelengths, accurately matching the sun’s light qualities that could revolutionize indoor agriculture and help night-shift workers. The use of polarized light from LEDs could also improve computer displays and lower the glare from car headlights.1

Transformerless Circuit Controls Speed of Energy
 
Most LED lighting companies use a transformer to appropriately drive an LED. Transformers, however, emit heat; that heat reduces a light bulb’s energy efficiency. US Lighting Group has created a proprietary “transformerless” circuit that controls the speed of energy powered to the LED. Eliminating the expense of an additional circuit board and timely assembly that goes along with it allows us to put money into the part that matters most, the actual LED. Our driverless and transformerless technology allows our LED lights to offer maximum efficiency.
 
Ballast or no-ballast fluorescent lighting retrofits
 
Most businesses use fluorescent lighting for work areas, conference rooms, and hallways. These fixtures have a “ballast” which regulates the amount of electricity going through the fluorescent tube providing enough electricity to “start up.” Our BH4 and GFY LED lighting product lines do not require a ballast in its fixture, allowing for maximum energy efficiency. Our FEB Ballast Compatible line of bulbs eliminates the guesswork and retrofitting associated with these fixtures. These LED bulbs are “plug-and-play” so customers do not have to worry about the type of ballast, and they can literally begin saving money on their electricity by removing the old fluorescent bulb and replacing it with our Ballast Compatible LED Bulbs.
 
LED Technology
 
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, commercial and residential LED usage has shown that LED lights use at least 75% less energy and last 25 times longer than incandescent bulbs. The actual LED component determines a light’s efficiency. To ensure our LED is the most efficient, we use one of the most powerful LEDs available, such as Samsung LM561C, that emits the most lumens per watt. All LEDs are rated to last at least 100,000 hours. However, this lifespan is only possible should an LED not exceed clearly defined power and temperature limits, which is the main consideration behind our “transformerless” design.
 
Principal Products 
 
US Lighting Group designs, manufactures, and distributes 4’ LED tube lights that are superior in power usage, lifespan, warranty, and cost savings, because of the exclusive minimalistic design and proprietary manufacturing processes. Channels to market include The Home Depot drop ship program, and earlier in the company history, a chain of regional distributors. US Lighting Group, Inc. has research and development, testing, and production facilities based in Euclid, Ohio, USA where all products are engineered and manufactured from domestic and imported components.
 
The US Lighting Group currently produces a series of bulbs, each with their own unique specifications and applications:
 

● | BH4 Series is our flagship LED light bulb line and has remained our top seller throughout the years. The BH4 bulb is a powerful, highly efficient top-level bulb offering the greatest savings potential and longest life span at 21 years. This light has been engineered to emit zero RF. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | GFY Series designed for those looking for something a little less powerful and lower cost. This series combines the demand for lower-watt bulbs with the need for highly efficient, sustainable lighting options to create two highly affordable LED bulb options. This tube is more cost-effective on the upfront purchase, while still offering a 15-year warranty and significant savings on energy costs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FEB Series is our plug-and-play LED lighting option with power at each end that works with both electronic and magnetic ballasts.

Distribution and Current Market 
 
LED lighting is a commodity product, which has become very competitive due to overseas imports with low pricing, making it a difficult climate for US Lighting Group, Inc. to operate in. We are looking into other LED lighting product lines that would leverage our electronics innovativeness to provide more specialty-type LED lighting. US Lighting Group has a supplier contractual relationship with The Home Depot. Customers can order product online at HomeDepot.com and it ships to the customer directly from our warehouse, however the sales have been minimal in the last two years.
 
US Lighting Group is looking at other industries such as robotics and fiberglass, but they are still in the early development stage.

The Automotive Electronics global market includes automotive software, electrical/electronic component, ECUs/EDUs, power electronics, sensors, software, integration, verification and validation, and other electronic components.2
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has made a significant impact on the automotive industry. The automotive industry may see a shift in its global supply chain due to the level of dependence on Chinese production and tooling. The industry could potentially reduce its reliance on China, because of the supply chain disruptions. In this scenario, a larger percentage of production could feasibly move back to the U.S. It is expected that the Chinese tooling and production industries will be extremely aggressive with pricing and will have the full backing of local Chinese authorities and governments. Our strategic business plan for Intellitronix includes plans to reduce our dependency on Chinese imports.3 In 2020, we made significant investments in our manufacturing equipment thereby reducing our future dependency on Chinese imports.
 

* | Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the rate of return that would be required for an investment to grow from its beginning balance to its ending balance, assuming the profits were reinvested at the end of each year of the investment’s lifespan.
