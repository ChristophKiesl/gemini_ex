ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
GrowGeneration Corp. (together with all of its wholly owned subsidiaries, collectively “GrowGeneration” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Colorado in 2014 and is the largest chain of hydroponic garden centers in North America and is a leading marketer and distributor of nutrients, growing media, advanced indoor and greenhouse lighting, environmental control systems and accessories for hydroponic gardening. Currently, the Company owns and operates a chain of fifty two (52) retail hydroponic/gardening stores across 12 states, with eighteen (18) in the state of California, six (6) in the state of Michigan, eight (8) located in the state of Colorado, five (5) in the State of Oklahoma, five (5) in Maine, two (2) in the state of Nevada, two (2) in the state of Washington, two (2) in the state of Oregon, one (1) in the state of Rhode Island, one (1) in the state of Florida, one (1) in the state of Arizona, one (1) in the state of Massachusetts, one (1) in the state of Arizona, an online e-commerce store, GrowGeneration.com and a commercial e-commerce platform, Agron.io. We recently announced the signing of two leases in Los Angeles and Rancho Dominguez, CA, which are our 53rd and 54th locations. Proprietary brands owned by the Company include Canopy Crop Management Corp, CharCoir Inc, and the Company introduced several private-label brands across multiple product categories from LED lighting to nutrients and additives and other products for indoor cultivation.
 
Our plan is to continue to acquire, open and operate hydroponic/gardening stores and related businesses throughout North America.

Markets
 
GrowGeneration sell thousands of products, including nutrients, growing media, advanced indoor and greenhouse lighting, environmental control systems, vertical benching and accessories for hydroponic gardening, as well as other indoor and outdoor growing products, that are designed and intended for growing a wide range of plants. Hydroponics is a specialized method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent, as opposed to soil. This method is typically used for indoor cultivation to give growers the ability to better regulate and control nutrient delivery, light, air, water, humidity, pests, and temperature. Hydroponic growers benefit from these techniques by producing crops faster and with higher crop yields per acre as compared to traditional soil-based growers. Indoor growing techniques and hydroponic products are being utilized in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp. In addition, vertical farms producing organic fruits and vegetables also utilize hydroponics due to a rising shortage of farmland as well as environmental vulnerabilities including drought, other severe weather conditions and insect pests.
 
GrowGeneration serves a new, yet sophisticated community of commercial and urban cultivators growing specialty crops including organics, greens and plant-based medicines. Unlike the traditional agricultural industry, these cultivators use innovative indoor and outdoor growing techniques to produce specialty crops in highly controlled environments. This enables them to produce crops at higher yields without having to compromise quality, regardless of the season or weather and drought conditions.
 
Controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) is a technology-based approach to maintain optimal growing conditions throughout the development of the crop. Production takes place within an enclosed growing structure such as a greenhouse or building. Plants are often grown using hydroponic methods in order to supply the proper amounts of water and nutrients to the root zone. CEA optimizes the use of resources such as water, energy, space, capital and labor. Different techniques are available for growing in controlled environment agriculture. The more viable option is vertical farming. Vertical farming has the ability to produce crops all year round in a controlled environment, with the possibility of increased yield by adjusting the amount of carbon and nutrients the plants receive. 
 
Our target customer segments include the commercial growers in the plant-based medicine market, the craft grower and vertical farms who grow organically grown herbs and leafy green vegetables. The landscape for hydroponic retail stores is very fragmented, with numerous single stores which we consider “targets” for our acquisition strategy. Further, the products we sell are in demand due to the ever-increasing legalization of plant-based medicines, primarily cannabis and hemp, and the increasing number of licensed cultivation facilities in North America. Total sales for the hydroponic equipment industry are projected to surpass $16 billion by 2025. The Company believes there are over 15,000 active cannabis cultivation licenses in North America. The average cultivation facility is approximately 36,000 sq. ft. and over 34,000,000 pounds of cannabis is projected to be cultivated by 2025.
 
Our retail operations are driven by a wide selection of all hydroponic products, service and solutions driven staff and pick, pack and ship distribution and fulfillment capabilities. We employ approximately 590 employees, a majority of them we have branded as “Grow Pros”. Currently, our operations span over 800,000 square feet of retail and warehouse space.
 
We operate our business through the following business units:
 

● | Retail: 52 hydroponic/gardening centers focused on serving growers and cultivators.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commercial: Sales to commercial customers, including large multi-state operators and cultivators.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | E-Commerce/Omni-channel: Our e-commerce operation, includes GrowGeneration.com and Agron.io, a business-to-business (B2B) online portal for commercial growers. GrowGeneration.com is currently adding “Buy online/Pick up in store” same day pick up service. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Distribution/Supply Chain: Some of our garden centers have multi-functions, with added capabilities that include warehousing, distribution and fulfillment for direct shipments of products to garden center locations, pick, pack and ship for our online platforms and direct fulfillment to our commercial customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proprietary Brands and Private Label: GrowGeneration sells a variety of products, including nutrients, growing media, advanced indoor and greenhouse lighting, ventilation systems, vertical benching, environmental control systems and accessories for hydroponic gardening. Our supply chain includes thousand’s stock keeping units (“SKUs”) across 16 product departments. Over 60% of our products are consumables, that feed the plants, generating recurring orders by our customers. Our strategy is to supply products to two groups of customers: commercial growers and craft growers that require a local center to fulfill their daily and weekly growing needs. We have developed a line of private label products that we are selling through our garden centers under proprietary brands we own and trademarked. Our strategy is to deliver a one-stop shopping experience, through selection, service and solutions for our customers.

Store Acquisitions and New Store Openings
 
Core to our growth strategy is to expand the number of our retail garden centers throughout North America. The hydroponic retail landscape is fragmented, which allows us to acquire the “best of breed” hydroponic operations. In addition to the 12 states we are currently operating in, we have identified new market opportunities in states that include Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Mississippi and Missouri. In 2020, we opened a second hydroponic/gardening center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a 40,000 square feet store operation and fulfillment center, and completed eight (8) acquisitions, adding 14 new locations in 2020. The Company acquired 14 new locations in the first quarter of 2021 and has an active target pipeline of acquisitions which are planned to close in 2021.
Commercial Sales Division
 
Our commercial division is focused on selling end to end solutions for large commercial cultivators. When a commercial customer gains a new cultivation license, they will need to purchase lighting, benching, environmental control systems, irrigation, fertigation and other products to outfit their cultivation facility. Commercial customers typically purchase in larger dollar amounts and sizes of products. We offer commercial customers volume pricing, terms and financing. Our commercial team manages thousands of commercial accounts across North America. Our commercial division collectively contributed approximately $49 million in revenue for 2020 compared to approximately $17 million for 2019, a 189% year over year increase. We have identified over 15,000 active licensed growers in North America and believe there is significant room for us to expand our base of commercial customers.
 
E-Commerce/Omni-Channel Division
 
Our digital strategy is focused on capturing the home, craft and commercial grower online. GrowGeneration.com offers over 10,000 hydroponic products, all curated by our product team. GrowGeneration.com offer customers the option to have their orders shipped directly to their locations, anywhere in North America or alternatively customers can buy online and pick up in store. Revenue for 2020 was approximately $10.6 million compared to approximately $4.8 million for 2019, an increase of 123%. New visitors to our website were 1.2 million in 2020 versus 477,000 in 2019, an increase of 152% year over year. Our online garden center closed 17,000 transactions in 2020 versus 6,300 in 2019, an increase of 170%. On March 19, 2021, the Company purchased, Agron.io. a leading wholesale agriculture portal that allows commercial growers to manage their purchasing and logistics in one platform. Powered by proprietary ERP technology, Agron.io offers commercial pricing, real-time inventory and one of the largest product catalog in the industry, with over 10,000 products in over 60 categories, including greenhouses, extraction, hemp, and commercial equipment. The platform manages real-time product updates, tier-pricing changes, case quantities, pallet quantities, profit margin projections, hazmat fees, ETL/UL listings and state chemical regulations, as well as guarantees the latest shipping rates using API Pallet.

Supply Chain
 
Our supply chain currently spans 800,000 sq. ft. of retail and warehouse space, across 52 locations and 12 states. Today, we operate distribution and fulfillment out of our 60,000 sq. ft location in Sacramento, CA and 40,000 sq. ft. in Tulsa, OK. The Company announced on March,9, 2021 the addition of a total of 122,000 sq. ft., including 52,000 sq. ft. in downtown Los Angeles, CA and 70,000 sq. ft. in Rancho Dominguez, CA, that will serve as warehousing for our private-label products, distribution and fulfillment for the Company. We are in the process of building several additional locations that will serve as fulfillment service centers, that include a 25,000 sq. ft. location in Phoenix, AZ. and a 58,000 sq. ft. location in Medley, FL. The Company expects these locations to be open by the summer of 2021. 
Proprietary Brands and Private Label
 
GrowGeneration purchased Canopy Crop Management Corp., in December 2020, the developer of the popular Power Si line of monosilicic acid products, a widely used nutrient additive for plants. On March 12, 2021, the Company purchased Char Coir, a line of premium coco pots, cubes and medium. Both Power Si and Char Coir are brands that generate over $10,000,000 in annual sales. We believe that expanding our private label offerings will have a positive impact on our margins and profitability in the near term. We use various trademarks, trade names in our private- label business, including Ion Lighting, Sunleaves, powder nutrients and additive line, Optilime Bulbs, Blueprint controllers and timers, Growxcess pots and containers, Harvest Edge, pruners, trellis and other gardening accessories, and Durabreeze fans and dehumidifiers. Both “GrowGeneration” and “Where the Pros Go to Grow” are trademarks used to brand and market our garden centers across North America.

Community Service and Charity
 
The Company has recently announced its partnership with Whole Cities Foundation. Founded by Whole Foods Market in 2014, the independent, nonprofit organization is based in Austin, Texas, and has partnered with more than 190 community organizations in 100 cities across the U.S. to build thriving local food systems and improve health. The first project, with Whole Cities, through its Fresh, Healthy Food Access Grant program, has been with Newark Science & Sustainability and Greater Newark Conservancy over the past 4 years.  Both organizations had identified hydroponic growing as a goal for their community plans.  Each group will benefit from an equipment grant. These first two opportunities are part of a pilot that we expect will yield learnings over the course of the year. GrowGeneration will provide equipment and expertise and partner with Whole Cities to evaluate community impact.

As we have built a national chain of hydroponic garden centers, it has always been our mission to give back to the local communities. In our day-to-day operations, we see the results growing hydroponically. We could not be prouder to partner with Whole Cities to donate hydroponic equipment and supplies to their local communities to help them with their gardens and increase the quality of their food production. Our staff of approximately 590 dedicated team members, the majority of whom are experienced in how to grow hydroponically, are energized to lend a hand and their personal time to support Whole Cities. It is rewarding to watch a community, come together, parents and children, and produce the largest tomatoes and produce in their community!
 
Further, in December 2020, the Company donated $10,000 to the Make- A- Wish Foundation to grant “a wish” to a child. The Company is an active contributor and supporter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
 
How We Evaluate Our Operations
 
Sales
 
The Company generates sales primarily from the sale of hydroponic garden products, including nutrients, growing media, advanced indoor and greenhouse lighting, environmental control systems, vertical benching, and accessories for hydroponic gardening, as well as other indoor and outdoor growing products. The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services at which point, the performance obligation is satisfied. Sales and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. Customer deposits and lay away sales are not reported as revenue until final payment is received and the merchandise has been delivered.
 
Our sales depend on the type of products we sell and the mix between consumables and non-consumables. Due to their nature, purchases of consumables result in repeat orders as customers seek to replenish their supplies. In 2020, approximately 60% of our sales were consumables. Generally, in new markets where legalization of plant-based medicines is recent and licensors are ramping up their grow operations, there are more purchases of non-consumables for buildouts compared to purchases of consumables. In more mature markets, there are generally more purchases of consumables than non-consumables. Our sales are also impacted by our customer mix of commercial and non-commercial customers, as larger commercial customers may receive volume discounts. More than a majority of our sales are derived from our commercial customers.
 
Gross Profit
 
We calculate gross profit as sales less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold consists of cost of product sold and freight. Gross profit excludes depreciation and amortization, which are presented separately in our consolidated statement of operations.
 
Our overall gross profit margin varies with our product mix, in particular the percentage of sales of consumable products versus non-consumables, such as in connection with buildouts, during a particular quarter. In addition, our customer mix impacts gross profit margin due to larger commercial customers receiving discounts.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Operating expenses are comprised of store operations, primarily payroll, rent and utilities, and corporate overhead. Corporate overhead is comprised of share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative costs and corporate salaries and related expenses. General and administrative expenses (“G&A”) consist mainly of advertising and promotions, travel & entertainment, professional fees and insurance. G&A as a percentage of sales does not increase commensurate with an increase in sales. Our largest expenses are payroll and rent and these are largely fixed and not variable. Our advertising and marketing expenses are controllable and variable depending on the particular market.

Same-Store Sales
 
We assess the organic growth of our sales on a same-store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same-store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial results and provides relevant information to assess our performance. New and acquired stores become eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base if the store has been under our ownership for the entire period in the same-store base periods for which we are including the store. For example, our same store sales for the full year 2020 and 2019 includes 21 stores that operated for the entire year. We do not include any stores that were closed or consolidated during a particular period.
 
Research and Development

The Company has not incurred any research and development expenses during the period covered by this report. 
 
Customers and Suppliers
 
Our key customers vary by state and are expected to be more defined as the Company moves from its retail walk-in purchasing sales strategy to serving cultivation facilities directly and under predictable purchasing activity. Currently, none of our customers accounted for more than 5% of our sales in 2020 or 2019.
 
Our key suppliers include several manufacturers and distributors such as Hawthorne Garden Supply, Hydrofarm, Fluence Engineering, Advanced Nutrients, House and Gardens, FoxFarm Fertilizer, Canna, USA, and others. All the products purchased and sold are applicable to indoor and outdoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based medicines. As of December 31, 2020, two suppliers represented 41% of all our purchases, a decrease of 18% from 2019. The Company is of the opinion that the loss of either supplier would not have a material adverse impact on our business. The Company maintains direct manufacturing agreements with many vendors.
 
Acquisitions
 
The Company purchased a total of 14 stores in 2020 and 14 stores through March 12, 2021. The Company also completed the acquisitions of two leading product companies, Canopy Crop Management in December 2020 and Char Coir, on March 14, 2021.

Seasonality
 
Our business is subject to some seasonal influences. Historically, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second and third fiscal quarters, and the lower volume occurs during our first or fourth fiscal quarter. 
Competition
 
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. Our key competitors include many local and national vendors of gardening supplies, local product resellers of hydroponic and other specialty growing equipment, as well as online product resellers and large online marketplaces such as Amazon.com and eBay. Our industry is a highly fragmented industry with over 1,000 retail hydroponic retailers throughout the U.S.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are the largest chain of hydroponic garden centers in North America and our pricing, inventory and product availability and overall customer service, provide us with the ability to compete in our industry. In addition, as we continue to increase the number of garden centers and inventory per store, we expect to be able to continue to purchase inventory at lower volume prices, which we expect will enable us to price competitively and deliver the products that our customers are seeking. The Company competes by delivering the widest selection of hydroponics products, end to end solutions for all types of cultivation environments, in-store sales and product support, direct manufacturer pricing and world-class customer service.
 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
Our intellectual property consists of our brands and their related trademarks, domain names and websites, customer lists and affiliations, product knowledge and technology, and marketing intangibles. We also hold rights to website addresses related to our business including websites that are actively used in our day-to-day business such as www.GrowGeneration.com. We own the federally registered trademark for “GrowGeneration®” “Where the Pros Go to Grow®”. In addition, we own several registered trademarks acquired in March 2019.
Government Regulation
 
We sell products, including hydroponic gardening products, that end users may purchase for use in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp, that may not grow or achieve market acceptance in a manner that we can predict. The demand for these products depends on the uncertain growth of these industries or segments. 
 
In addition, we sell products that end users may purchase for use in industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp, that are subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions.  For example, certain countries and 36 U.S. states have adopted frameworks that authorize, regulate, and tax the cultivation, processing, sale, and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of other U.S. states prohibit growing cannabis. In addition, with the passage of the Farm Bill in December 2018, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also removes restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law. We believe the recent passage of the 2018 Farm Bill will allow the Company to expand its marketplace opportunities.
 
Our gardening products, including our hydroponic gardening products, are multi-purpose products designed and intended for growing a wide range of plants and are purchased by cultivators who may grow any variety of plants, including cannabis and hemp.  Although the demand for our products may be negatively impacted depending on how laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions develop, we cannot reasonably predict the nature of such developments or the effect, if any, that such developments could have on our business.
