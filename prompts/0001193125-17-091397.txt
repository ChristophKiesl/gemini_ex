Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Background 
 The Company is a Delaware corporation, which was formed in 2005. It operates through operating subsidiaries, including InfuSystem Holdings USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Holdings), InfuSystem, Inc., a California corporation (ISI), First Biomedical, Inc., a Kansas corporation (First Biomedical) and IFC, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (IFC). 
Business Concept and Strategy 
 We are a leading provider of infusion pumps and related products and services for patients in the home, oncology clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, and other sites of care from five locations in the United States and Canada. We provide our products and services to hospitals, oncology practices and facilities and other alternate site health care providers. Headquartered in Madison Heights, Michigan, we deliver local, field-based customer support, and also operate pump service and repair Centers of Excellence in Michigan, Kansas, California, Texas, Georgia and Ontario, Canada. ISI is accredited by the Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP) while First Biomedical is ISO certified. 
 Our core service is to supply electronic ambulatory infusion pumps and associated disposable supply kits to oncology clinics, infusion clinics and hospital outpatient chemotherapy clinics to be utilized in the treatment of a variety of cancers including colorectal cancer, pain management and other disease states (Oncology Business). Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent form of cancer in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, and the standard of care for the treatment of colorectal cancer relies upon continuous chemotherapy infusions delivered via ambulatory infusion pumps. 
 In addition, we sell or rent new and pre-owned pole mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps to, and provide biomedical recertification, maintenance and repair services for oncology practices as well as other alternate site settings including home care and home infusion providers, skilled nursing facilities, pain centers and others. We also provide these products and services to customers in the hospital market. 
 We purchase new and pre-owned pole mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps from a variety of sources on a non-exclusive basis. We repair, refurbish and provide biomedical certification for the devices as needed. The pumps are then available for sale, rental or to be used within our ambulatory infusion pump management service. 
 One aspect of our business strategy is to expand into treatment of other cancers. In 2016, our Oncology Business approximated 64% of our total revenues. In 2016, we generated approximately 40% of our total revenues from treatments for colorectal cancer and 24% of our revenues from treatments for non-colorectal disease states. There are a number of approved treatment protocols for pancreatic, head and neck, esophageal and other cancers, as well as other disease states which present opportunities for growth. There are also a number of other drugs currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA), as well as agents in the pharmaceutical development pipeline, which we believe could potentially be used with continuous infusion protocols for the treatment of diseases other than colorectal cancer. Additional drugs or protocols currently in clinical trials may also obtain regulatory approval over the next several years. If these new drugs or protocols obtain regulatory approval for use with continuous infusion protocols, we expect the pharmaceutical companies to focus their sales and marketing efforts on promoting the new drugs and protocols to physicians. 
 Another aspect of our business is to seek opportunities to leverage our extensive billing capabilities, pump resources and networks of oncology practices and insurers. This leverage may take the form of new products and/or services, strategic alliances, joint ventures and/or acquisitions. One of these is providing our ambulatory pumps, products, and services in the area of post-surgical peripheral nerve block. With regard to acquisitions, we 
 
3 
 
 believe there are additional opportunities, beyond our acquisition of Ciscura Holding Company, Inc., and its subsidiaries (Ciscura) that was made in April 2015, to acquire smaller, regional competitors, in whole or part that perform similar services to us but do not have the national market access, network of third-party payor contracts or operating economies of scale that we currently enjoy. We also plan to leverage our extensive networks of oncology practices and insurers by distributing complementary products, including pain management and smart pumps, and introducing key new information technology based services such as BlockPain DashboardTM, EXPRESSTM, InfuBusTM or InfuConnectTM, InfuTrackTM and Pump PortalTM. 
 We face the risk that other competitors can provide the same services as we provide. That risk is currently mitigated and barriers to entry are created by our (i) growing number of third-party payor networks under contract, which exceeded 450 third-party payor networks for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 110 networks, or 32%, over the prior year period; (ii) economies of scale, which allow for predictable reimbursement and less costly purchase and management of the pumps, respectively; (iii) established, long standing relationships as a provider of pumps to outpatient oncology practices in the U.S.; (iv) established national presence with Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs); (v) pump fleet of ambulatory and large volume infusion pumps for rent and for sale, which may allow us to be more responsive to the needs of physicians, outpatient oncology practices, hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, homecare practices, patient rehabilitation centers and patients than a new market entrant; (vi) six geographic locations in the U.S. and Canada that allow for same day or next day delivery of pumps with plans for a seventh in the northeastern U.S.; and (vii) pump repair and service capabilities at all of these facilities. We do not perform any research and development on pumps, but we have made, and continue to make, significant investments in developing our information technology as described below. 
 Management is intent on extending its considerable breadth of payor networks under contract as patients move into different insurance coverages, including Medicaid and Insurance Marketplace products. In some cases, this may slightly reduce our aggregate billed revenues payment rate but result in an overall increase in collected revenues, as shown by a reduction in bad debt expense. Consequently, we are increasingly focused on net collected revenues less bad debt. 
 In the midst of changes in the healthcare arena, we believe that we will support our overall business strategy discussed above by (i) focusing on supporting recurring revenues by increasing our pump fleet; (ii) improving liquidity and strengthening the balance sheet by keeping debt levels comparable to our operations; (iii) improving internal operational efficiencies; (iv) increasing our product and services offerings; (v) enhancing our technology offerings to the patients and providers of care; and (vi) investigating synergistic acquisitions. 
 Continuous Infusion Therapy 
 Continuous infusion of chemotherapy involves the gradual administration of a drug via a small, lightweight, portable infusion pump over a prolonged period of time. A cancer patient can receive his or her medicine anywhere from one to 30 days per month depending on the chemotherapy regimen that is most appropriate to that individuals health status and disease state. This may be followed by periods of rest and then repeated cycles with treatment goals of progression-free disease survival. This drug administration method has replaced intravenous push or bolus administration in specific circumstances. The advantages of slow continuous low doses of certain drugs are well documented. Clinical studies support the use of continuous infusion chemotherapy for decreased toxicity without loss of anti-tumor efficacy. The 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines recommend the use of continuous infusion for treatment of numerous cancer diagnoses. We believe that the growth of continuous infusion therapy is driven by three factors: evidence of improved clinical outcomes; lower toxicity and side effects; and a favorable reimbursement environment. 
 Significant recent progress has been made in the treatment of colorectal cancer due to advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In the late 1990s, medical researchers discovered that the delivery method of the drug (or schedule) was a key component to drug availability, efficacy and tolerability. Schedule dependent anti-
 
4 
 
 tumor activity and toxicity has resulted in continuous infusion 5-Fluorouracil being adopted as the standard of care. In 2000, the FDA approved Camptosar (the trade name for the generic chemotherapy drug Irinotecan), a drug developed by Pfizer, for first-line therapy in combination with 5-Fluorouracil for the treatment of colorectal cancer. In 2002, the FDA approved Eloxatin (the trade name for the generic chemotherapy drug Oxaliplatin), a drug developed by Sanofi-Aventis, for use in combination with continuous infusion 5-Fluorouracil for the treatment of colorectal cancer. FOLFIRI, the chemotherapy protocol which includes Camptosar in combination with continuous infusion 5-Fluorouracil and the drug Leucovorin, and FOLFOX, the chemotherapy protocol which includes Eloxatin in combination with continuous infusion 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin, have resulted in significantly improved overall survival rates for colorectal cancer patients at various stages of the disease state. We believe that Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer have each dedicated significant resources to educating physicians and promoting the use of FOLFOX and FOLFIRI. Simultaneously, the NCCN has established these regimens as the standards of care for the treatment of colorectal cancer. 
 The use of continuous infusion has been demonstrated to decrease or alter the toxicity of a number of cytotoxic, or cell killing agents. Higher doses of drugs can be infused over longer periods of time, leading to improved tolerance and decreased toxicity. For example, the cardiotoxicity (heart muscle damage) of the chemotherapy drug Doxorubicin is decreased by schedules of administration according to The Chemotherapy Source Book by Michael C. Perry. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decreased white blood cell and platelet counts are all affected by duration of delivery. Continuous infusion can lead to improved tolerance and patient comfort while enhancing the patients ability to remain on the chemotherapy regimen. Additionally, the lower toxicity profile and resulting reduction in side effects enables patients undergoing continuous infusion therapy to continue a relatively normal lifestyle, which may include continuing to work, going shopping, and caring for family members. We believe that the partnering of physician management and patient autonomy provide for the highest quality of care with the greatest patient satisfaction. 
 We believe that oncology practices have a heightened sensitivity to whether and how much they are reimbursed for services. Simultaneously, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and private insurers are increasingly focusing on evidence-based medicine to inform their reimbursement decisions  that is, aligning reimbursement with clinical outcomes and adherence to standards of care. Continuous infusion therapy is a main component of the standard of care for certain cancer types because clinical evidence demonstrates superior outcomes. Payors recognize this and it is reflected in favorable reimbursement for clinical services related to the delivery of this care. 
 Services 
 Our core service is our Oncology Business. After providing ambulatory pumps to oncology offices, infusion clinics and hospital and outpatient chemotherapy clinics, we then directly bill and collect payment from payors and patients for the use of these pumps. At any given time, our pumps are in the possession of these facilities, on a patient, in transport, or in our facilities for cleaning, calibration and storage as reserves for increased demand. 
 After a physician determines that a patient is eligible for ambulatory infusion pump therapy, the physician arranges for the patient to receive an infusion pump and provides the necessary chemotherapy drugs. The physician and nursing staff train the patient in the use of the pump and initiate service. The physician bills the payors, which include Medicare, Medicaid, third-party payor companies or patients for the physicians professional services associated with initiating and supervising the infusion pump administration, as well as the supply of drugs. We directly bill (i) payors and (ii) patients for copays and deductibles, for the use of the pump and related disposable supplies. Billing to payors requires coordination with patients and physicians who initiate the service, as physicians offices must provide us with appropriate documentation (patients insurance information, physicians order, an acknowledgement of benefits that shows receipt of equipment by the patient, and, in some cases, physicians progress notes) in order for us to submit a bill to the payors. We do provide assistance to those that cannot afford our pumps via our financial hardship program  a program that usually matches what our physician practices provide as long as the uninsured patients meet certain criteria. This billing process is handled from our Madison Heights, Michigan location. 
 
5 
 
In addition to providing high quality and convenient care, we believe that our business offers significant economic benefits for patients, providers and payors. 
 

 | We provide patients with 24-hour by 7 days a week (24x7) service and support. We employ oncology, pain, and Intravenous Certified and Oncology Certified registered nurses trained on ambulatory infusion pump equipment who staff our 24x7 hotline to address questions that patients may have about their pump treatment, the infusion pumps or other medical or technical questions related to the pumps.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Physicians use our services to outsource the capital commitment, pump service, maintenance and billing and administrative burdens associated with pump ownership. Our services also allow the doctor to continue a direct relationship with the patient and to receive professional service fees for setting up the treatment and administering the drugs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We provide methods for the physician offices to deliver the appropriate paperwork for billing through a number of electronic means including EXPRESSTM and InfuConnectTM  reducing the required effort on the employees of the physician offices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We believe our services are attractive to payors because such services are generally less expensive than hospitalization or home care.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other services we offer include the rental, sale or leasing of pole mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps to oncology practices, hospitals and other clinical settings. As of December 31, 2016, our rental fleet of pole mounted and ambulatory pumps had a historical gross cost of $59.0 million, up from $53.7 million from the end of 2015, and included approximately 70 makes and models of equipment dedicated to our rental services. These pumps are available for daily, weekly, monthly or annual rental periods. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a fleet of new and used pole mounted and ambulatory pumps with a historical cost of $1.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, for sale or lease. 
 In addition to sales, rental and leasing services, we also provide biomedical maintenance, repair and certification services for the devices we offer as well as for devices owned by customers but not acquired from us. We operate pump service and repair Centers of Excellence from all of our locations across the United States and Canada and employ a staff of highly trained technicians to provide these services. Our main Center of Excellence for service is our Lenexa, Kansas facility. 
 We also offer electronic ambulatory infusion pumps for post-operative pain management using our pumps along with a numbing agent and a continuous nerve block catheter  continuous peripheral nerve block (CPNB). Using CPNB for the management of post-operative pain, which usually lasts two to three days after surgery, can result in reduced pain for the patient, increased satisfaction scores for the surgical center or hospital, and reduced need for post-operative medication. 
 Information Technology 
 The Companys first Chief Information Officer was hired in 2013 to transform the Companys Information Technology (IT) platform and enhance business processes beginning in 2014. IT refocused on not only supporting our internal IT needs to reduce our platforms and redundant systems from two IT platforms into a consolidated solution but also in supporting electronic medical record technology (EMR) to be used by medical facilities using the Companys infusion pumps and services via our solutions such as EXPRESSTM and InfuConnectTM. This focus has enabled current billing information to be transferred to the Company from these facilities electronically and automatically, bypassing the current methods of mail, email, and/or facsimile. We expect that this new focus will continue to strengthen our relationships with our existing customers and result in additional investment in intangible software assets by the Company. Additional IT customer focused solutions are PumpPortalTM, InfuTrackTM (Pump Fleet Lifecycle Management Solutions) and BlockPain DashboardTM. Our continued focus on IT efforts has resulted in the following new products:

--+--------------------------------

 In 2016 and 2015, the Company capitalized in excess of $3.3 million and $5.6 million, respectively, into IT, with specific focus as discussed above, plus other internal operational efficiencies and new products and support. 
 Relationships with Physician Offices 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had business relationships with clinical oncologists in excess of 1,800 outpatient oncology clinics. Although this represents a substantial number of the oncologists in the United States, we believe we can continue to expand our network to further penetrate the oncology market. Based on our retention rates and the positive results of our professional customer satisfaction research, we believe our relationships with physician offices are strong. 
 We believe that, in general, we do not compete directly with hospitals and physician offices to treat patients. Rather, by providing products and services to hospitals and physician offices and other care facilities and providers, we believe that we assist other providers in meeting increasing patient demand and managing institutional constraints on capital and manpower due to the nature of limited resources in hospitals and physician offices. 
 
7 
 
Physician practices in the oncology field are consolidating  similar to healthcare practices in general. However, as of December 31, 2016, we had gained more facilities than we had lost. We expect this trend to continue in the near future. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 250 employees, including 238 full-time employees and 12 part-time or contract employees. None of our employees are unionized. 
 Material Suppliers 
 We supply a wide variety of pumps and associated equipment, as well as disposables and ancillary supplies. The majority of our pumps are electronic infusion pumps purchased from the following manufacturer, which supplies more than 10% of the ambulatory pumps purchased by us: Smiths Medical, Inc. The Company has a supply agreement in place with this supplier. Certain spot purchases are made on the open market subject to individual negotiation. 
Seasonality 
 Our business rental activity is not subject to seasonality. Revenues from this activity, net of bad debt, may be seasonal due to the impact of co-pays and deductibles for patients insurance that traditionally reset each January. This has been further impacted by changes in the insurance industry as it responds to increased government regulation. Also, rental customers tend to make buy versus rent decisions late in the year as customer capital budgets are being finalized, impacting sales revenue in the second half of the year, predominantly in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, as the Companys liquidity has improved, opportunistic pump purchases are made from time to time. These opportunistic pump purchases also allow for opportunistic pump sales, which could be material. The timing of such purchases and sales vary within the course of a year. 
Environmental Laws 
 We are required to comply with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws regulating the disposal of cleaning agents used in the process of cleaning our ambulatory infusion pumps, as well as the disposal of sharps and blood products used in connection with the pumps. We do not believe that compliance with such laws has a material effect on our business. 
Significant Customers 
 We have sought to establish contracts with as many third-party payor organizations as commercially practicable, in an effort to ensure that reimbursement is not a significant obstacle for providers who recommend continuous infusion therapy and wish to utilize our services. A third-party payor organization is a health care payor or a group of medical services payors that contracts to provide a wide variety of health care services to enrolled members through participating providers such as us. A payor is any entity that pays on behalf of a member patient. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had contracts with more than 450 third-party payor networks, an increase of 110 networks, or 32%, over the prior year period. Material terms of contracts with third-party payor organizations are typically a set fee or rate, or a discount from billed charges for equipment provided. The majority of these contracts generally provide for a term of one year, with automatic one-year renewals, unless we or the contracted payor elect not to renew. For 2016 and 2015, our largest contracted payor was Medicare, which accounted for approximately 21% and 32% of our net revenue from our Oncology Business for 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately 13% and 19% of our total revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Medicare represented 5% and 23% of our consolidated accounts receivable, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 
8 
 
Prior to July 1, 2016, our Oncology business model provided ambulatory pumps to oncology offices, infusion clinics and hospital and outpatient chemotherapy clinics and we would directly bill and collect payment from third party payors and patients for the use of these pumps. Effective July 1, 2016, we implemented Medical Learning Network (MLN) Matters Number SE1609 Medicare Policy Clarified for Prolonged Drug and Biological Infusions Started Incident to a Physicians Service Using an External Pump clarification article (SE1609) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The implementation of SE1609 resulted in our revenues being reduced by approximately $2.6 million for the second half of 2016. For additional information regarding SE1609, see Recent Events in Our Business  CMS in this Form 10-K. 
 For 2016 and 2015, our next largest contracted payor, was a national association comprised of multiple members, which, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 19% and 18% of our net revenue from our Oncology Business for 2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately 13% and 12% of our total revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. This same contracted payor represented 26% and 31% of our consolidated accounts receivable, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also contract with various other third-party payor organizations, Medicaid, commercial Medicare replacement plans, self-insured plans and numerous other insurance carriers. Other than the payors noted above, no other single payor represented more than 10% of third-party payor net revenue. 
 Competitors 
 We believe that our competition is primarily composed of regional durable medical equipment (DME) providers, hospital-owned DME providers, physician providers and home care infusion providers. An estimate of the number of competitors is not known or reasonably available, due to the wide variety in type and size of the market participants described below. We are not aware of any industry reports with respect to the competitive market described below. The description of market segments and business activities within those market segments is based on our experiences in the industry. 

 | Regional DME Providers: Regional DME providers act as distributors for a variety of medical products. We believe regional DME provider sales forces generally consist of a relatively small number of salespeople, usually covering several states. Regional DME providers tend to carry a limited selection of infusion pumps and their salespeople generally have limited resources. Regional DME providers usually do not have 24x7 nursing services. We believe that regional DME providers have relatively few third-party payor contracts, which may prevent these providers from being paid at acceptable levels and may also result in higher out-of-pocket costs for patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Hospital-owned DME Providers: Many hospitals have in-house DME providers to supply basic equipment. In general, however, these providers have limited capital and tend to stock a small inventory of infusion pumps. We believe that hospital-owned providers have limited ability to grow because of limited patient populations. Growth from outside of the hospital may pose a challenge because hospitals typically will not provide referrals to competitors, instead preferring to offer patients a choice of non-hospital-affiliated DME providers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Physician Providers: A limited number of physicians maintain an inventory of their own infusion pumps and provide them to patients for a fee. However, we believe that pump utilization in this area tends to be low and the costs associated with ongoing supplies, preventative maintenance and repairs can be relatively high. Moreover, we believe that a high percentage of DME claims by doctors are rejected by payors upon first submission, requiring a physicians staff to spend significant time and effort to resubmit claims and receive payment for treatment. The numerous service and technical questions from patients may present another significant cost to a physician providers staff.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Home Care Infusion Providers: Home care infusion providers provide chemotherapy drugs and services to allow for in-home patient treatment. We believe that home care infusion treatment can be very costly and that many patients do not carry insurance coverage that covers home-based infusion services, resulting in larger out-of-pocket costs. Because home care treatments may take as long as six
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9 
 

months, these costs can be high and can result in higher patient co-payments. We believe that home care providers may also be reluctant to offer 24x7 coverage or additional patient visits, due to capped fees.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation of Our Business 
 Our business is subject to certain regulations. Specifically, as a Medicare supplier of DME and related supplies, we must comply with supplier standards established by CMS regulating Medicare suppliers of DMEPOS (DMEPOS Supplier Standards). The DMEPOS Supplier Standards consist of 30 requirements that must be met in order for a DMEPOS supplier to be eligible to receive payment for a Medicare-covered item. Some of the more significant DMEPOS Supplier Standards require us to (i) advise Medicare beneficiaries of their option to purchase certain equipment, (ii) honor all warranties under state law and not charge Medicare beneficiaries for the repair or replacement of equipment or for services covered under warranty, (iii) permit CMS agents to conduct on-site inspections to ascertain compliance with the DMEPOS Supplier Standards, (iv) maintain liability insurance in prescribed amounts, (v) refrain from contacting Medicare beneficiaries by telephone, except in certain limited circumstances, (vi) answer questions and respond to complaints of beneficiaries regarding the supplied equipment, (vii) disclose the DMEPOS Supplier Standards to each Medicare beneficiary to whom we supply equipment, (viii) maintain a complaint resolution procedure and record certain information regarding each complaint, (ix) maintain accreditation from a CMS approved accreditation organization, and (x) meet certain specified surety bond requirements. 
 We are also subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which are designed to protect the security and confidentiality of certain patient health information. Under HIPAA, we must provide patients access to certain records and must notify patients of our use of personal medical information and patient privacy rights. Moreover, HIPAA sets limits on how we may use individually identifiable health information and prohibits the use of patient information for marketing purposes. The adoption of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) includes a new breach notification requirement that applies to breaches of unsecured health information occurring on or after September 23, 2009. We are subject to regulations in the various states in which we operate. We believe we are in material compliance with all such regulations. 
 In addition, the ACA imposes a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices that applies to sales within the United States of a majority of our pump products that we purchase. This law imposes an excise tax on the first sale of medical devices by a manufacturer, producer, or importer equal to 2.3% of the sales price. This tax only applies directly to new pumps that we purchase from manufacturers. Taxable medical devices include any device as defined in Section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act intended for humans, with the exception of eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and any other device determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be a type which is generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use. On December 18, 2015, under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), this excise tax was given a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax by Section 4191 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). Thus, the medical device excess tax does not apply to the sale of a taxable medical device by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the device during the period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017. The results of the November 8, 2016 U.S. presidential election creates uncertainty for the future of the ACA and other health care-related legislation. Future legislation could have a material effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Recent Events in Our Business 
 CMS 
 On April 25, 2016, CMS released SE1609. This clarification article is intended for all physicians and hospital outpatient departments submitting claims to Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) for prolonged drug and biological infusions started incident to a physicians service using an external pump. It 
 
10 
 
 should be noted that this article does not apply to suppliers claims submitted to Durable Medical Equipment (DME) MACs. 
 We interpret SE1609 as no longer permitting DME suppliers to submit billings to the DME MACs for the infusion pumps and supplies provided to Medicare patients in the circumstances described in SE1609. More particularly, SE1609 provides that when a drug is provided incident to physicians services rendered to patients while in the physicians office or hospital outpatient department, the external pump is not separately billable as DME. This applies to any DME supplier, home infusion company, hospital outpatient clinic or physician office that provides ambulatory infusion pumps in a setting where treatment is initiated in the infusion setting prior to the patient being sent home for long term infusion. SE1609 states that an ambulatory infusion pump and supplies are not separately reimbursable as DME when a Medicare patient leaves an infusion setting and goes home with a pump. SE1609 indicates that the administration of the drug billed to the local Medicare Contractor should also include payment for the DME used in furnishing the service. Under existing laws, in order for Medicare to cover the cost of the drug and external pump, a physician, hospital, clinic, home infusion therapy company or DME supplier must incur a cost for the drug and pump. 
 We have historically submitted billings directly to DME MACs for our infusion pumps and portfolio of related services in the circumstances described above. In this regard, Medicare accounted for 21% and 32% of our total net revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 5% and 23% of our consolidated accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015, respectively. As a result of SE1609, we now submit these billings, effective July 1, 2016, directly to physicians or hospitals who, in turn, will seek reimbursement from Medicare. In these cases, the providing physicians or hospitals, rather than Medicare, will be the primary obligor to us for payments for our infusion pumps and portfolio of related services. 
 It is important to note that SE1609 applies only to Medicare patients and, therefore, we currently expect that SE1609 will have no direct material impact on the majority of patients or our customers who are insured by private commercial carriers. In these cases, which currently represent a substantial majority of our revenues, we already submit billings directly to these private commercial carriers. 
 We estimate that the transition to the alternative direct billing arrangement and other recent announcements regarding commercial billing will in aggregate have a gross reduction to our net revenue due exclusively to the pricing impact of approximately $1.3 million per quarter. However, our response to this change as well as the expected changes in the competitive dynamics in the marketplace stemming from this change could mitigate this decline in revenue. These include: 
 

 | We are continuing to align processes with the new billing model, which we expect to reduce costs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ultimate impact of SE1609 will vary as we make internal changes in the short-term and as the market is reshaped in the long term. We believe that the reduction in revenue resulting from the pricing decrease could ultimately be mitigated by 2018 through our response as well as potential benefits gained from the competitive changes in the marketplace.

In addition to restoring profitability, we intend to reduce debt through reduced capital investment in both IT systems and pump fleet. 
 Finally, however, there can be no assurance that SE1609 and the associated competitive dynamics in the marketplace will not further impact future revenues and net income or implicate other risks referred to in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2016. The estimates provided above are our best estimates of future events that may or may not be obtainable and there can be no assurance that we will achieve such results. 
 Restatement 
 As previously disclosed, we restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and for each of the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2015 through June 30, 2016 (the Restated Periods). The determination to restate the financial statements for the Restated Periods was made by our Audit Committee upon managements recommendation following the identification of errors principally related to an overstatement of estimated accounts receivable collections. Due to the errors, our management concluded that the Companys previously issued financial statements for the Restated Periods should no longer be relied upon. The Company filed amended reports for the Restated Periods with restated consolidated financial statements correcting the errors. 
Material Weakness 
 In our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on December 12, 2016, we reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the calculation error primarily related to our overstatement of estimated accounts receivable collections. With the oversight of our finance department and Audit Committee, we undertook significant efforts to remediate our material weakness in internal controls and as of December 31, 2016, we remediated the material weakness. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we designed, implemented and executed additional controls with regard to the calculation of our estimate of accounts receivable collections and have taken steps, including simplifying the calculation model, ensuring additional review of the calculation model by senior management and internal audit and involving outside accounting experts to review the model for accuracy and consistency, to assure that adequate procedures are in place on a go forward basis to remediate this weakness. These additional controls were tested as of December 31, 2016 and determined to be operating effectively. We will continue to refine and improve our design and operating effectiveness of internal control during 2017 and beyond. 
Credit Facility 
 During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made optional pre-payments of $4.8 million on its Term Loan A, which was applied against a future mandatory payment. Prepayments of $1.9 million were applied to the September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015 Term Loan A required principal payments and prepayments of $2.9 million were applied to the March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 Term Loan A required principal payments. 
 Our financial restatement error that effected our 2015 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Qs for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 along with our decision to prepay debt, resulted in the Company being non-compliant with its fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under its credit facility as of March 31, 2016, however, as of June 30, 2016, we would have been in compliance with this ratio covenant. As a result of our restatement of prior consolidated financial statements described herein, the following Events of Default occurred under the credit agreement governing the credit facility: 
 

(i) | an Event of Default resulting from our breach of the Fixed Charge Coverage covenant as of March 31, 2016 as required under Section 6.12(b); and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | an Event of Default resulting from the unintentional misrepresentations made prior to the date of the First Amendment (as defined below) in connection with the certification as to the accuracy of the
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
12 
 

financial statements and compliance certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 as they relate solely to the source of the error that has necessitated the restatement discussed herein.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also experienced an Event of Default due to the delay in filing our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 because of our financial restatement. 
 In order to cure these violations, we entered into the first amendment to credit agreement and waiver (the First Amendment) on December 5, 2016. This First Amendment amends the credit agreement in the following material respects: 
 

(i) | a waiver of the Event of Default that resulted from the failure to timely deliver the unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 as required under Section 5.01(b) and (c);
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | a waiver of the Event of Default that resulted from breach of the Fixed Charge Coverage covenant as of March 31, 2016 as required under Section 6.12(b);
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | a waiver of the Event of Default that resulted from the unintentional misrepresentations made prior to the date of the First Amendment in connection with the certification as to the accuracy of the financial statements and compliance certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 as they relate solely to the source of the error that has necessitated the restatement discussed herein;
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | a restructuring of the credit facility that effectively consolidated Term Loan A and Term Loan B into a single Term Loan resulting in a new total drawn amount of $32 million under the Term Loan with the approximately $5 million excess over the current aggregate drawn amounts under Term Loan A and Term Loan B to be available to reduce our drawings under the revolving credit line;
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(v) | set the maturity of the new Term Loan described in item (iv) and the revolving credit line to five years from the effective date of the First Amendment;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(vi) | set the quarterly mandatory principal payment due on the Term Loan to $1.3 million due on the last business day of each fiscal quarter with any remaining unpaid and outstanding amount due at maturity;
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(vii) | amend the deadline for delivery of consolidated financial statements to allow for the delivery of such statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 by December 16, 2016;
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(viii) | amend the deadline for delivery of our annual financial plan and forecast to 30 days after the end of each fiscal year;
-------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ix) | amend the Leverage Ratio covenant to provide for the following schedule of maximum permitted ratios: (i) 3.0 to 1.0 at any time on or after the effective date but prior to December 31, 2015, (ii) 2.75 to 1.0 at any time on or after December 31, 2015 but prior to March 31, 2017, (iii) 2.50 to 1.0 at any time on or after March 31, 2017 but prior to March 31, 2018 or (iv) 2.25 to 1.00 at any time on or after March 31, 2018;
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(x) | amend the definition of EBITDA to provide for the exclusion of certain one-time expenses directly related to the financial restatement described herein; and
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(xi) | amend Section 8.01(a) to replace references to Jonathan Foster with Christopher Downs.
