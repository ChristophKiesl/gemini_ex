ITEM 1. 
 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Overview

We are a digital media holding company for online assets primarily targeted to the military and public safety sectors. We are dedicated to providing those that keep us safe places to go online where they can do everything from staying current on news and events affecting them, look for jobs, share information, communicate with the public, and purchase products. We own and manage websites which are customized to provide our niche users, including active, reserve and retired military, law enforcement, first responders and other public safety employees with information and news that we believe may be of interest to them. We have placed a particular emphasis on providing quality content on our websites to drive traffic increases. Our websites feature timely, proprietary and aggregated content covering current events and a variety of additional subjects targeted to the specific demographics of the individual website. Our business strategy requires us to continue to provide this quality content to our niche markets and to grow our business, operations and revenues both organically and through acquisitions.

Presently, we generate revenue from two segments: product sales and services. Services include advertising revenue and subscriptions. While more than 78% of our revenues are generated from product sales in 2016, we intend to monetize our website traffic by attracting local, national and international advertisers, begin selling subscriptions to our websites and establishing the Bright Mountain Ad Network.

Currently, in addition to our corporate website, www.brightmountainmedia.com, we own the following website properties which we have acquired or developed since 2013:


· | Advertisetothemilitary.com | · | Militaryhousingrentals.com
· | BlackHelmetApparel.com | · | Militarystarter.com 
· | Bootcamp4me.com | · | Popularmilitary.com 
· | Bootcamp4me.org | · | Sargeslist.com 
· | Brightwatches.com | · | Teacheraffairs.com 
· | Coastguardnews.com | · | Thebright.com 
· | Fdcareers.com | · | Thebrightmail.com 
· | Fireaffairs.com | · | Usmclife.com 
· | Firefightingnews.com | · | Wardocumentaryfilms.com 
· | Gopoliceblotter.com | · | Warisboring.com 
· | JQPublicblog.com | · | Welcomehomeblog.com 
· | Leoaffairs.com | · | Thebravestonline.com 
· | Leofundme.com | · | Thebrightnetwork.com 


We also partner with third parties on five additional websites, havokjournal.com, Article107News.com, lawoffice.com, jointhemilitary.org and yuuut.com, under revenue sharing arrangements.

Over the past four years we have experienced rapid visitor growth, both organically and through acquisitions. With 26 website properties in addition to our corporate website, annual visits to our websites have increased from approximately 840,000 in 2013 to more than 57,000,000 visits in 2016. While we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions in future periods, we believe that our visitor traffic has achieved sufficient critical mass to permit us to aggressively implement our strategy to monetize our traffic by:


· | launching the Bright Mountain Media Ad Network, a programmatic advertising network similar to Google Ad Sense or the AOL1 platform, to our niche demographics; 
· | expanding internally or through outsourcing a sales force or call center to market direct ads to our websites and the launching of the Bright Mountain Media Ad Network;
· | begin selling subscriptions to selective websites; 

 
1




· | pursue local, national and international advertisers whose targets are our niche users; and 
· | seek ancillary sources of revenues through new products and services such as lead sales and employment advertisements.


We currently use social media, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, as additional distribution methods of our content. As the behavior of Internet consumers continues to change, distribution of our content via traditional methods such as our websites may become less effective, and new distribution strategies may need to be accelerated. Consumers are increasingly using social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to communicate and to acquire and disseminate information. As consumers migrate more towards social networks, we expect to continue to build social elements into our content in order to make them available on social networks. We also expect to continue to expand our content to include video and audio.

The market and our demographics

Our niche market for the military and public safety sectors consists of a targeted U.S. demographic of in excess of 40 million users including their spouses. Adding their parents and other direct family members could increase the U.S. targeted market to approximately 100 million users. We also believe there are another estimated 100 million military and public safety personnel and their families outside the U.S. The largest segments of the market are military veterans and retired firefighters and law enforcement. The following chart provides insight into our targeted demographics in the United States:

Sources: (1) U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; (2) FBI; (3) National Fire Protection Association; (4) U.S. Department of Defense 2017 Budget; (5) U.S. Department of Defense 2014, Demographics Profile of the Military Community; (6) U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Population Tables; and (7) National Survey of Veterans.

As a homogeneous group, our user profile should be attractive to local, national and international companies whose advertising budgets are shifting from print media, radio and television to the Internet. We believe that the market for the military and public safety providers is fragmented, and that we have an opportunity to become a leading player in the market through growth, consolidation and the creation of the Bright Mountain Media Ad Network which will be specifically targeted to our niche demographics.

As a result of the consistent increase in both the overall site traffic as well as unique visitors to our websites, we believe our company has reached sufficient critical mass to transition to a digital media company that generates most of its revenue from the sales of advertising on its websites. Together with revenues from our to-be-established Bright Mountain Media Ad Network, we believe that this natural evolution of our model will permit us to concentrate our efforts on growing our highest profit opportunities through the leverage of our website portfolios and the growing Internet audience. This is reinforced with our belief that digital marketing and advertising channels will experience budget increases as traditional print and other channels are likely to see budget reductions. We do anticipate, however, a time lag between the increase in expenses and the increase in advertising revenues as we implement our business strategy.

Current business and revenue streams

We have several revenue streams generated directly from our websites. The revenue streams consist principally of product sales and advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings as well as display advertisements appearing on our websites and subscriptions. We generate advertising revenue either directly from companies who pay us a fee for advertising space, or by users clicking on website advertisements utilizing several ad network partners such as Google AdSense. We generate subscription revenues by the sale of access to career postings on one of our websites. The term of the subscriptions range from one month to 12 months and range in price from $8.95 to $77.00. Revenues are recognized, on a net basis, over the term of the subscription period. We generate product revenues by the sale of watches, clocks, apparel and accessories through our websites BlackHelmet.com, BrightWatches.com and Gopoliceblotter.com as well as through e-commerce distributor portals such as Amazon and eBay. Additionally, we expanded our product sales segment by adding a retail location in Delray Beach, FL in the fourth quarter of 2014. During the third quarter of 2016 we began expanding our existing retail space at this location which became operational in February 2017 to provide additional retail and inventory space. We believe that having a retail presence has allowed us to expand our product lines.

BrightWatches.com, BlackHelmet.com and Gopoliceblotter.com are web-based stores where shoppers can purchase a variety of products including watches, clocks and apparel. We maintain an inventory of watches and clocks. Customers that purchase products from Brightwatches.com pay us directly in a fully enabled payment and checkout process that permits payments for purchases using credit cards through the Internet-based payment processing service PayPal. Our watches and clocks are also available for purchase through eBay and Amazon. Fulfillment of our orders of watches and clocks are either handled directly by Amazon when purchases are made through it or by us for purchases made through eBay or BrightWatches.com. Customers that purchase products from either BlackHelmet.com or Gopoliceblotter.com pay us directly in a fully enabled payment and checkout process that permits payments for purchases using credit cards through the Internet-based payment processing services. Certain of our apparel products are also available on Amazon. Fulfillment of orders of apparel is either handled directly by Amazon when purchases are made through it, shipped directly by a third party who produces the apparel for us or shipped by us.

Other recent developments

Warisboring.com

In January 2016 we closed the acquisition of the www.warisboring.com website and all content and rights associated therewith pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Website Asset Purchase Agreement dated December 4, 2015 with War Is Boring, Ltd. Co. and its principal David Axe. The aggregate purchase price of the assets was $250,000, of which $100,000 was paid at closing and the balance of $150,000 will be paid monthly in an amount equal to 30% of the net revenues from the website, when collected, with the total amount of the earn out to be paid by January 4, 2019. We also entered into a Website Management Services Agreement with Mr. Axe pursuant to which we engaged him to act as website manager for the www.warisboring.com website utilizing the War Is Boring, Ltd. content group. Under the terms of this agreement we agreed to pay Mr. Axe a monthly fee of $5,000 and pay the associated fees of the content group. The initial term of the agreement is for three years and may be renewed for an additional one year period upon the mutual consent of the parties. We may terminate the agreement upon 30 days notice in the event Mr. Axe should engage in willful misconduct as defined in the agreement.
Black Helmet Apparel

In December 2016 we acquired the assets of the Black Helmet Apparel business. Launched in June 2008 Black Helmet® clothing and accessories feature designs that are hand drawn, unique and relay the fearless side of firefighting. Following this transaction we have begun to leverage the unique designs and marketing aspects of Black Helmet Apparel to enhance and expand our online assets primarily targeted to the military and public safety sectors and have increased the inventory of Black Helmet Apparel to facilitate increased sales and take advantage of bulk purchasing discounts in an effort to increase margins on these products.

The Black Helmet clothing and accessories feature designs that are hand drawn, unique and relay the fearless side of firefighting, including:


· | T-shirts | · | jackets 
· | sweatshirts | · | drinkware 
· | wallets | · | knives 
· | hats | · | jewelry, including bracelets, earrings and pendants
· | decals and patches | · | phone accessories 
· | sunglasses | | 


The designs used on the Black Helmet products are proprietary to us. Mr. James Love, a firefighter, is the principal graphic artist responsible for these unique designs, which are initially hand drawn by him prior to being converted to digital art. Following our acquisition of the Black Helmet assets, which included all of the intellectual property rights associated with these designs, we engaged Mr. Love to provide certain consulting and advisory services to us including product designs. 

Since acquiring this business, we are preparing to launch new t-shirt designs and new accessory products, including a knife design, a backpack, hybrid workout and casual shorts, sunglasses, ties, dress shirts, badge wallets and belts. New hat designs are also in various stages of development. We also expect to utilize these assets to expand the brand into the police and military demographics with new products targeted to our core demographics.

Seasonally, the business follows a similar pattern to other domestic retailers, with approximately 40% of the sales occurring in November through mid-December for holiday gifts. Additionally, special emphasis and sales volume occurs surrounding St. Patricks Day and September 11. Jackets and snow hats are offered for winter and shorts and sunglasses for summer.

The Black Helmet products are sold primarily through the website at www.blackhelmetapparrel.com. We purchase products from a variety of local and international sources, and product sales are fulfilled from the Orlando, Florida warehouse. 

Pending acquisition of Daily Engage Media and launch of the Bright Mountain Media Ad Network

In March 2017 we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase all of the membership interests of Daily Engage Media LLC ("Daily Engage") from unrelated third parties for $4.9 million consisting of cash and shares of our common stock. In connection with the proposed acquisition of Daily Engage Media, at closing we will also enter into three year employment agreements with Messrs. Rezitis and Pagoulatos, two of the members, which provide for annual base compensation of $75,000 plus the ability to earn bonuses. The employment agreements are expected to contain customary confidentiality, non-intervention and assignment clauses.

Launched in 2015, Daily Engage Media is an ad network that connects advertisers with approximately 200 digital publications worldwide. Following the closing of the transaction, we expect to complete the development of the ad exchange platform Daily Engage Media has under development and utilize that technology for the basis of launching our Bright Mountain Media Ad Network. This new platform is expected to have a significant impact on our revenues and its capabilities will include:


· | server integration with several ad exchanges, making for extremely quick ad deployments; 
· | leading targeting technology, allowing advertisers to pinpoint their marketing efforts to reach the military-public safety demographic across mobile, tablet, and desktop;
· | capable of handling any ad format, including video, display, and native ads; and 
· | ad serving and self-service features for publishers and advertisers. 


Our Bright Mountain Media Ad Exchange will be a trading desk for publishers and advertisers where they will be able to login and choose from various features to maximize their earning potential. Publishers will be able to select a variety of ad units for their video, mobile, display and native advertisements and also have the ability to create their own unique ad formats. Advertisers will be able to choose where their ads will be seen using our filters or by connection directly with the publisher through our platform.

We are dependent upon the proceeds from a pending firm commitment public offering to close this pending transaction. Accordingly, there are no assurances this transaction with close.

Our strategy

If we are successful in our goal to transition to a digital media company, we expect to continue to focus our efforts in the target markets of military, law enforcement, and first responders  groups known by many advertisers and brands as our countrys heroes. Our business strategy is to provide quality content that focuses on all of these audience segments which we believe allows us to reach a deeper and broader niche demographic than our competitors.

We also expect to continue to seek strategic acquisitions that are related to our core mission and niche demographic which, to date, have been instrumental to our growth strategy. We believe that all of the programs and efforts to develop organic website traffic, and bring users and consumers to our websites, will continue to be enhanced through the addition of strategic acquisitions of other Internet properties. 

Our acquisition strategy is a reflection of our primary goals and is a basic tool to help accelerate the achievements of our core objectives which are:


· | growth of visitor traffic in our core demographics; 
· | growth of our service revenue; and 
· | leveraging our visitor traffic to further the growth of our e-commerce segment.


Once we acquire a website property, we improve the look and feel of the website to increase its appeal to our audience and add additional content targeted to the specific demographics of the acquired website property. In many instances we retain the services of the prior operator of the acquired website property for a transition period following the transaction to ensure a seamless integration into the Bright Mountain family of websites. It has been our experience that the improvements we make to acquired website properties have significantly increased historic website traffic to these sites.

Key relationships

We purchase a substantial amount of the products we sell through our websites from two vendors: Citizens Watch Company of America, Inc., and Bulova Corporation. During 2016, purchases from Citizens accounted for 38% and purchases from Bulova accounted for 17% of the total products purchased. These two vendors accounted for 34% and 26%, respectively, of total products purchased in 2015. 

We sell many of our products through various e-commerce distribution portals, which include Amazon and eBay. During 2016, these two distributor portals accounted for 65% and 10%, respectively of our total revenue. During 2015, these two portals accounted for 88% and 6%, respectively, of our total sales. A substantial amount of payments for our products sold are processed through PayPal and Stripe.

We offer display advertising on our websites either through direct advertisements or through numerous third party providers, including Google AdSense. Google AdSense is a free service, which displays text or image ads that correspond to the keywords of the content of the page on which the ad is shown. Each time a user of a host website clicks on an AdSense advertisement, Google provides a flat fee to the operators of that website on behalf of the applicable advertiser. Approximately 21% of our total revenue in 2016 from services came from Google AdSense as compared to approximately 36% in 2015.

Technology

Our top technical priority is the fast and reliable delivery of pages to our users. Our systems are designed to handle traffic and network growth. We rely on multiple tiers of redundancy/failover and third-party content delivery network to achieve our goal of 24 hours, seven-days-a-week Website uptime. Regular automated backups protect the integrity of our data. Our servers are continuously monitored by numerous third-party and open-source monitoring and alerting tools.

Competition

The Internet and industries that operate through it are intensely competitive. We compete with other companies that have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and distribution resources. Our competitors include Yahoo!, AOL and its subsidiary Huffington Post. Both AOL and Huffington Post were recently acquired by Verizon Communications as it looks for growth in the digital, mobile and video marketplace, and its previously announced pending acquisition of Yahoo! remains pending as of the date of this report.

We believe that we can effectively compete in the marketplace for the following reasons:


· | we have limited ourselves to certain niche, but significant and identifiable, markets; 
· | we have customized our websites to the interests of our users and provide excellent content and news; 
· | our CEO, W. Kip Speyer, has had extensive entrepreneurial and management experience, including experience with public companies; 
· | we have a highly focused group of 44 people, which include writers, programmers, researchers, site managers and editors, and 22 direct full-time and three part-time employees; and
· | we are able to manage future growth without a substantial increase in our infrastructure. 


Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources as well as greater experience in the industry than we have. There are no assurances we will ever be able to effectively compete in our marketplace. Our websites may not be competitive with other technologies and/or our websites may be displaced by newer technology. If this happens, our sales and revenues will likely decline. In addition, our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with larger companies, to gain access to greater development or marketing resources. Competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.

Intellectual property

We currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information. We own the following service marks and trademarks, which are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:

In addition to www.brightmountainmedia.com and www.thebright.com, we own multiple domain names that we may or may not operate in the future. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is also subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain names or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business.

Employees

At March 15, 2017 we had 22 full-time and three part-time employees. We also utilize the services of 22 independent contractors who provide content, operational and related website services. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees.

Government regulation

Aspects of the digital marketing and advertising industry and how our business operates are highly regulated. We are subject to a number of domestic and, to the extent our operations are conducted outside the U.S., foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and through other electronic means, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In particular, we are subject to rules of the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and potentially other federal agencies and state laws related to our advertising content and methods, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, which establishes certain requirements for commercial electronic mail messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial electronic mail messages that follow a recipients opt-out request or are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content, and federal and state regulations covering the treatment of member data that we collect from endorsers.

U.S. and foreign regulations and laws potentially affecting our business are evolving frequently. We currently have not developed our internal compliance program nor do we have policies in place to monitor compliance. Instead, we rely on the policies of our publishing partners. If we are unable to identify all regulations to which our business is subject and implement effective means of compliance, we could be subject to enforcement actions, lawsuits and penalties, including but not limited to fines and other monetary liability or injunction that could prevent us from operating our business or certain aspects of our business. In addition, compliance with the regulations to which we are subject now or in the future may require changes to our products or services, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our services. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The FTC adopted Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising on October 5, 2009. These guides recommend that advertisers and publishers clearly disclose in third-party endorsements made online, such as in social media, if compensation was received in exchange for said endorsements. Because some of our marketing campaigns entail the engagement of consumers to refer other consumers in their social networks to view adds or take action, and both we and the consumer may earn cash and other incentives, any failure on our part to comply with these guides may be damaging to our business. We currently do not take any steps to monitor compliance with these guides. In the event of a violation, the FTC could potentially identify a violation of the guides, which could subject us to a financial penalty or loss of endorsers or advertisers.

In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to Californias Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.

We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Any failure by us to comply with these privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the Internet is unclear and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our members privacy and data could result in a loss of member confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of members and customers, which could adversely affect our business.

ITEM 1.A 
RISK FACTORS.

Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that there are various risks in making any such investment. You should consider carefully these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report before you decide to purchase any of our securities. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you could lose your entire investment in our company.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY

We have a history of losses.

We incurred net losses of $2,667,051 and $1,673,094, respectively, for 2016 and 2015. At December 31, 2016 we had an accumulated deficit of $8,824,806. While our revenues increased 14% for 2016 from 2015, our selling, general and administrative expenses, or 
SG&A
, increased 40% in 2016 from 2015. Included in this increase in our SG&A in 2016 from 2015 is a 154% increase in non-cash expenses in 2016 from 2015 which was primarily attributable to a $321,056 non-cash amortization of debt discount we recognized upon the conversion of outstanding debt during 2016 as described elsewhere herein. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase and we may continue to incur losses in future periods until such time, if ever, as we are successful in significantly increasing our revenues and cash flow. There are no assurances that we will be able to significantly increase our revenues and cash flow to a level, which supports profitable operations and provides sufficient funds to pay our obligations.

Our auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. We have experienced substantial and recurring losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of $8,824,806 at December 31, 2016. We have been and expect to continue funding our business until, if ever, we generate sufficient cash flow to internally fund our business, with and through sales of our securities. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase and we will continue to incur substantial losses in future periods until we are successful in significantly increasing our revenues and cash flow. There are no assurances that we will be able to increase our revenues and cash flow to a level, which supports profitable operations and provides sufficient funds to pay our obligations. If we are unable to meet those obligations, we could be forced to cease operations in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company.

There are no assurances we will close the pending public offering, the acquisition of Daily Engage Media or launch the Bright Mountain Media Ad Network.

In March 2017 we entered into an agreement to purchase Daily Engage Media, utilizing a portion of the proceeds of a pending firm commitment public offering of our securities. Thereafter, utilizing technology which is being developed by Daily Engage Media and proceeds from the offering we will launch the Bright Mountain Media Ad Network. Our ability to close the acquisition of Daily Engage Media and launch the advertising network is wholly dependent upon the closing of the pending public offering. While it is being underwritten on a firm commitment basis, the underwriter is not contractually bound to purchase the securities and close the public offering until such time as we enter into an underwriting agreement which occurs immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement filed with the SEC for the offering. We are unsure as to the timing of the effectiveness of the registration statement. It is possible that the underwriter will determine at some time in the future prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement not to proceed with the offering, in which event we would be unable to close the acquisition of Daily Engage Media and our goal of launching the Bright Mountain Media Ad Network would be indefinitely postponed. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on the information in this report related to these future activities by us.

We could become subject to seasonal fluctuations in our revenues in future periods attributable to the sale of Black Helmet products.

Historically, Black Helmet reported 40% of its annual revenues in the fourth quarter, principally between mid-November and the end of December. It is anticipated that this seasonality may continue. Because of seasonal fluctuations, there can be no assurance that the results of any particular quarter will be indicative of results for the full year or for future years.

There are no assurances our transition to an advertising and subscription revenue based model will be successful.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we began to transition our company to a digital media company that will generate most of its revenue from the sales of advertising on its websites thereby reducing our dependence on product sales revenues. During 2017 we also plan to expand our current subscription offering to include subscriptions to certain of our additional websites. While we believe that this natural evolution of our model will permit us to concentrate our efforts on growing our highest profit opportunities through the leverage of our website portfolios and growing Internet audience, there are no assurances we will be successful in these efforts. In addition to increasing our dependence on our relationship with Google until such time as we are able to launch the Bright Mountain Ad Network, we will become subject to significant competition from a variety of companies on a global scale with few barriers to entry in our market and many of these competitors have better name recognition and are better capitalized than our company. As a result, we may not be able to keep pace with our competitors marketing campaigns, pricing policies, and technological advances. We will also be required to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and continually improve the speed, performance, features, ease of use and reliability of our websites. This includes making our products and services compatible and maintaining compatibility with multiple operating systems, desktop and mobile devices, and evolving network infrastructure. If we are unable to effectively adapt to competitive factors and compete effectively in the marketplace, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and the price of our common stock.

We are dependent upon our relationships with Amazon, eBay and PayPal and one or more of these relationships can be terminated at will.

Product sales represented 78% of our total revenues for 2016 and 83%, of our total revenues in the 2015. We sell our products through various distribution portals, which include Amazon and eBay, and through direct sales. During 2016, Amazon accounted for 65%, eBay accounted for 10% and direct sales accounted for 25% of our total revenue from product sales. During 2015, Amazon accounted for 88%, eBay accounted for 6%, and direct sales accounted for 6% of our total revenue from product sales. A substantial amount of payments for our products sold are processed through PayPal and Stripe and Amazon handles certain fulfillment of product orders for us. Our agreements with any of these companies may be terminated at will. Due to high concentration and reliance on these portals, and the dependence on PayPal and Stripe, the loss of a working relationship with any of these entities could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods. Given the dominance of these entities in their respective sectors, in the event our relationship with one or more of these entities was terminated, there are no assurances we would be able to locate a suitable successor company.

Our product sales revenues have historically been dependent upon our relationships with two vendors. There are no assurances we will be able to continue to rely on those relationships in future periods.

During 2016 we purchased a substantial amount of the products we sell through our websites from two vendors: Citizens Watch Company of America, Inc., and Bulova Corporation. Citizens Watch Company of America, Inc. accounted for 38% and Bulova Corporation accounted for 17% of total products purchased in 2016. These two vendors accounted for 34% and 26%, respectively, of total products purchased in 2015. While we seek to continue to expand our product lines by adding companies to our list of vendors, and continue to expand our product lines and vendor relationships including through the acquisition of Black Helmet Apparel in December 2016 as described elsewhere in this report, due to our high reliance on these two vendors, the loss of one of these vendors could adversely affect our operations. We do not have any long term contracts with either vendor and these relationships can be terminated at will. There are no assurances our efforts to diversify our vendor base will be successful.

We are presently dependent on our relationship with Google AdSense to generate revenues from advertising sales.

We offer display advertising on our websites either through direct advertisements or through numerous third party providers, including Google AdSense. Approximately 21% of our total revenue in 2016 from services came from Google AdSense as compared to approximately 36% in 2015. From time-to-time Google may implement policy changes that could impact our ability to display ads. We expect that once developed and launched, all of our advertising revenue will come from the Bright Mountain Media Ad Network. Until such time, however, if our revenues from Google AdSense continue to increase in future periods, such potential policy changes could cause volatility in our advertising revenue and earnings and the loss of the access to Google AdSense could have an adverse effect on our business.

The acquisition of new businesses is costly and these acquisitions may not enhance our financial condition.

A significant element of our growth strategy is to acquire companies which complement our business. The process to undertake a potential acquisition can be time-consuming and costly. We have and continue to expect to expend significant resources to undertake business, financial and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition targets and there is no guarantee that we will acquire the company after completing due diligence. The process of identifying and consummating an acquisition could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of acquired companies. In some instances, we may be required to provide historic audited financial statements for up to two years for acquisition targets in compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The necessity to provide these audited financial statements will increase the costs to us of consummating an acquisition or, if it is determined that the target company cannot obtain the requisite audited financials, we may be unable to pursue an acquisition which might otherwise be accretive to our business. In addition, even if we are successful in acquiring additional companies, there are no assurances that the operations of these businesses will enhance our future financial condition. To the extent that a business we acquire does not meet the performance criteria used to establish a purchase price, some or all of the goodwill related to that acquisition could be charged against our future earnings, if any.

Online security breaches could harm our business.

User confidence in our websites depends on maintaining strong security features. While we have not experienced any security breaches to date, experienced programmers or hackers could penetrate sectors of our systems. Because a hacker who is able to penetrate network security could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services, we may have to expend significant capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate problems caused by hackers. Additionally, we may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security. Such security breaches could materially affect our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to risk of loss or litigation. In addition, the transmission of computer viruses resulting from hackers or otherwise could expose us to significant liability. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with whom we have relationships.

We must promote the Bright Mountain brand to attract and retain users, advertisers and strategic partners.

The success of the Bright Mountain brand depends largely on our ability to provide high quality content which is of interest to our users. If our users do not perceive our existing content to be of high quality, or if we introduce new content or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably perceived by users, we may not be successful in promoting and maintaining the Bright Mountain brand. Any change in the focus of our operations creates a risk of diluting our brand, confusing users and decreasing the value of our website traffic base to advertisers. If we are unable to maintain or grow the Bright Mountain brand, our business would be severely harmed.

We may expend significant resources to protect our content or to defend claims of infringement by third parties, and if we are not successful we may lose rights to use significant material or be required to pay significant fees.

Our success and ability to compete are dependent on our proprietary content. We rely exclusively on copyright law to protect our content. While we actively take steps to protect our proprietary rights, these steps may not be adequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriation of our content, which could severely harm our business. In addition to content written by our employees, we also acquire content from various freelance providers and other third-party content providers. While we attempt to ensure that such content may be freely used by us, other parties may assert claims of infringement against us relating to such content. We may need to obtain licenses from others to refine, develop, market and deliver new content or services. We may not be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all or rights granted pursuant to any licenses may not be valid and enforceable.


11


Failure to protect our intellectual property rights or claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business.

Our website domain names are crucial to our business. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is also subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain names or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business. We also rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. Others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our intellectual property rights. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our technology and designs adequately against unauthorized third party use, which could adversely affect our ability to compete.

Developing and implementing new and updated applications, features and services for our websites may be more difficult than expected, may take longer and cost more than expected and may not result in sufficient increases in revenue to justify the costs.

Attracting and retaining users of our websites requires us to continue to provide quality, targeted content and to continue to develop new and updated applications, features and services for our websites. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or if we are unable to implement new applications, features and services without disruption to our existing ones, our ability to continue to expand our website traffic will be in jeopardy. The costs of development of these enhancements may negatively impact our ability to achieve profitability. There can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from expanded website content, or updated technologies, applications, features or services will justify the amounts ultimately spent by us.

Our technology development efforts may not be successful in improving the functionality of our network, which could result in reduced traffic on our websites.

If our websites do not work as intended, or if we are unable to upgrade the functionality of our websites as needed to keep up with the rapid evolution of technology for content delivery, our websites may not operate properly, which could harm our business. Additionally, software product design, development and enhancement involve creativity, expense and the use of new development tools and learning processes. Delays in software development processes are common, as are project failures, and either factor could harm our business.

We are dependent upon consultants to provide key operational support for our Black Helmet Apparel business.

In connection with our acquisition of the assets of the Black Helmet Apparel business, we entered into consulting agreements with the two principals to provide operational services for those assets. If we should lose the services of one or both of these individuals our ability to effectively operate and grow that portion of our business will be in jeopardy until such time as we are able to recruit and engage suitable replacements.

We are dependent upon independent writers to provide content for our warisboring.com website.

In connection with our acquisition of the warisboring.com website and associated content in January 2016, we entered into a Website Management Services Agreement with the seller under which he was engaged to manage the website for us on a full-time basis. Under the terms of this agreement he is also responsible for providing continuing access to the same content group which provided content to the website before we acquired it. We are dependent upon this group of contributors to provide proprietary content for this website. We do not have any agreements with these individual content providers and there are no restrictions on these independent contractors which prohibit them from providing content to competing websites. If we should lose the services of one or more of these content providers for this website our ability to provide proprietary content on this website will be in jeopardy until such time as we are able to recruit and engage suitable replacement content providers.


12


Our ability to deliver our content depends upon the quality, availability, policies and prices of certain third-party service providers.

We rely on third parties to provide website hosting services. In certain instances, we rely on a single service provider for some of these services. In the event the provider were to terminate our relationship or stop providing these services, our ability to operate our websites could be impaired. Our ability to address or mitigate these risks may be limited. The failure of all or part of our website hosting services could result in a loss of access to our websites which would harm our results of operations.

We may be held liable for content, blogs or third party links on our website or content distributed to third parties.

As a publisher and distributor of content over the Internet, including blogs which appear on our websites and links to third-party websites that may be accessible through our websites, or content that includes links or references to a third-partys website, we face potential liability for defamation, negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature, content or ownership of the material that is published on or distributed from our websites. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services, websites and print publications in the past. Other claims may be based on errors or false or misleading information provided on linked websites, including information deemed to constitute professional advice such as legal, medical, financial or investment advice. Other claims may be based on links to sexually explicit websites. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liabilities imposed. Any liability that is not covered by our insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could severely harm our financial condition and business. Implementing measures to reduce our exposure to these forms of liability may require us to spend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our websites to users.

Our management may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions and to manage our growth and we may be unable to fully realize any anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.

We are subject to various risks associated with our growth strategy, including the risk that we will be unable to identify and recruit suitable acquisition candidates in the future or to integrate and manage the acquired companies. Acquired companies histories, the geographical location, business models and business cultures will be different from ours in many respects. Successful integration of these acquisitions is subject to a number of challenges, including:


· | the diversion of management time and resources and the potential disruption of our ongoing business; 
· | difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; 
· | unexpected costs and time associated with upgrading both the internal accounting systems as well as educating each of their staff as to the proper methods of collecting and recording financial data;
· | potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses; 
· | the difficulty of retaining key alliances on attractive terms with partners and suppliers; and 
· | the difficulty of retaining and recruiting key personnel and maintaining employee morale. 


There can be no assurance that our efforts to integrate the operations of any acquired assets or companies will be successful, that we can manage our growth or that the anticipated benefits of these proposed acquisitions will be fully realized.


13


We depend on the services of our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President - Digital and the loss of either of their services could harm our ability to operate our business in future periods

Our success largely depends on the efforts, reputation and abilities of W. Kip Speyer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Todd F. Speyer, our Vice President - Digital. While we are a party to an employment agreement with Mr. Kip Speyer and do not expect to lose his services in the foreseeable future, the loss of the services of Mr. Kip Speyer could materially harm our business and operations in future periods. We are not a party to an employment agreement with Mr. Todd Speyer, his son. While we do not expect to lose the services of Mr. Todd Speyer in the foreseeable future, if he should choose to leave our company our business and operations could be harmed until such time as we were able to engage a suitable replacement for him.

We must hire, integrate and/or retain qualified personnel to support our expected business expansion.

Our success also depends on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel. In addition, because our users must perceive the content of our websites as having been created by credible and notable sources, our success also depends on the name recognition and reputation of our editorial staff. Competition for qualified personnel is intense and we may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business will suffer.

We deliver advertisements to users from third-party ad networks which exposes our users to content and functionality over which we do not have ultimate control.

We display pay-per-click, banner, cost per acquisition "CPM", direct, and other forms of advertisements to users that come from third-party ad networks. We do not control the content and functionality of such third-party advertisements and, while we provide guidelines as to what types of advertisements are acceptable, there can be no assurance that such advertisements will not contain content or functionality that is harmful to users. Our inability to monitor and control what types of advertisements get displayed to users could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our services may be interrupted if we experience problems with our network infrastructure.

The performance of our network infrastructure is critical to our business and reputation. Because our services are delivered solely through the Internet, our network infrastructure could be disrupted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:


· | unexpected increases in usage of our services; 
· | computer viruses and other security issues; 
· | interruption or other loss of connectivity provided by third-party internet service providers;
· | natural disasters or other catastrophic events; and 
· | server failures or other hardware problems. 


If our services were to be interrupted, it could cause loss of users, customers and business partners, which could have a material adverse.


14


Our systems may fail due to natural disasters, telecommunications failures and other events, any of which would limit user traffic.

Our websites are hosted by third party providers. Any disruption of in the computing platform at these third party providers could result in a service outage. Fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, supplier failure to meet commitments, and similar events could damage these systems and cause interruptions in the hosting of our websites. Computer viruses, electronic break-ins or other similar disruptive problems could cause users to stop visiting our website and could cause advertisers to terminate any agreements with us. In addition, we could lose advertising revenues during these interruptions and user satisfaction could be negatively impacted if the service is slow or unavailable. If any of these circumstances occurred, our business could be harmed. Our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to any failures of or interruptions in our systems. We do not presently have a formal disaster recovery plan.

Our websites must accommodate high volumes of traffic and deliver frequently updated information. While we have not experienced any systems failures to date, it is possible that we may experience systems failures in the future and that such failures could harm our business. In addition, our users depend on Internet service providers, online service providers and other website operators for access to our websites. Many of these providers and operators have experienced significant outages in the past, and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems. Any of these system failures could harm our business.

Privacy concerns could impair our business.

We have a policy against using personally identifiable information obtained from users of our websites without the users permission. In the past, the Federal Trade Commission has investigated companies that have used personally identifiable information without permission or in violation of a stated privacy policy. If we use personal information without permission or in violation of our policy, we may face potential liability for invasion of privacy for compiling and providing information to our corporate customers and electronic commerce merchants. In addition, legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify Internet users that the data may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the user. Other countries and political entities, such as the European Union, have adopted such legislation or regulatory requirements. The United States may adopt similar legislation or regulatory requirements in the future. If consumer privacy concerns are not adequately addressed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.

We are subject to a number of regulatory risks. Any failure to comply with the various regulations could adversely impact our business in future business.

We are subject to a number of domestic and, to the extent our operations are conducted outside the U.S., foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and through other electronic means, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. U.S. and foreign regulations and laws potentially affecting our business are evolving frequently. We currently have not developed our internal compliance program nor do we have policies in place to monitor compliance. Instead, we rely on the policies of our publishing partners. If we are unable to identify all regulations to which our business is subject and implement effective means of compliance, we could be subject to enforcement actions, lawsuits and penalties, including but not limited to fines and other monetary liability or injunction that could prevent us from operating our business or certain aspects of our business. In addition, compliance with the regulations to which we are subject now or in the future may require changes to our products or services, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our services. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Risks Related to the Ownership of our Securities

We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements. If we fail to remediate any material weaknesses or if we fail to establish and maintain effective control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013). Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that as of December 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as a result of material weaknesses. We identified material weaknesses, which included:


· | our company currently has only two employees who are responsible for handling the cash and making deposits, posting cash receipts, writing and mailing checks, and posting cash disbursements. Our CFO reviews bank statements and reconciliations on a monthly basis as a mitigating control until such time as funds are available to us to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives, and
· | we do not currently have monitoring controls in place to ensure correct analysis and application of GAAP. 


While we have implemented a plan to remediate these weaknesses, we cannot assure you that we will be able to remediate these weaknesses, which could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our failure to remediate the material weaknesses identified above or the identification of additional material weaknesses in the future, could adversely affect our ability to report financial information, including our filing of quarterly or annual reports with the SEC on a timely and accurate basis. Moreover, our failure to remediate the material weaknesses identified above or the identification of additional material weaknesses could prohibit us from producing timely and accurate financial statements, which may adversely affect our the market price of shares of our common stock or warrants and we may be unable to maintain compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements.

Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of potential gain.

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our shares of common stock and warrants will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.


16


Some provisions of our charter documents and Florida law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.

Provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Florida law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:


· | permit our board of directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate; 
· | provide that all vacancies on our board of directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; 
· | provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide advance notice in writing, and also satisfy requirements as to the form and content of a shareholders notice;
· | not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election; and 
· | provide that special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the board of directors or by the holders of at least 40% of our securities entitled to notice of and to vote at such meetings. 


These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Section 607.0902 of the Florida Business Corporation Act provides provisions which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. As permitted under Florida law, we have elected not to be governed by this statute. Any provision of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Florida law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock or warrants, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our shares of common stock or warrants.

Our company has a concentration of stock ownership and control, which may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change of control

Our common stock ownership is highly concentrated. Mr. W. Kip Speyer, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, together with members of our board of directors and a principal shareholder, beneficially owns approximately 56% of our total outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of the concentrated ownership of the stock, Mr. Speyer and our Board may be able to control all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company. It could also deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and it may affect the market price of our common stock.

The conversion of our outstanding 10% Series A convertible preferred stock and/or payment of stock dividends on these shares will be dilutive to our common shareholders.

At March 31, 2017 we had 100,000 shares of our 10% Series A convertible preferred stock outstanding. These shares are convertible into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis at the option of the holder at any time until December 30, 2017, at which time they are automatically converted into common stock if not previously converted. The conversion of these shares of preferred stock will result in the issuance of an additional 100,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, the designations, rights and preferences of the 10% Series A convertible preferred stock provide that a 10% annual dividend is payable in shares of our common stock at a rate of one share of common stock for each 10 shares of preferred stock outstanding. These dividends are payable in January of each year. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon the conversion of the 10% Series A convertible preferred stock and/or as payment of dividends on the shares will be dilutive to our existing shareholders and could adversely impact the market price of our common stock, should a market be developed of which there is no assurance.
