Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on November 13, 2017 (“Inception”) as a Delaware corporation, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses (a “Business Combination”) with a focus for a target business in the energy industry, and an emphasis on opportunities in the upstream oil and gas industry in North America where our management team’s collective networks and experience are suited. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash and marketable securities.
 
In connection with our formation, a total of 10,062,500 shares of Class B common stock were sold to our Sponsor at a price of approximately $0.002 per share for an aggregate of $25,000 (the “Founders’ Shares”). In March 2018, our Sponsor returned to us, at no cost, an aggregate of 1,437,500 Founders’ Shares, which we cancelled, leaving an aggregate of 8,625,000 Founders’ Shares outstanding. In March 2018, our Sponsor transferred 40,000 Founders’ Shares to each of our three (3) independent director nominees resulting in a total of 120,000 Founders’ Shares transferred to our independent director nominees. In April 2018, we effected a stock dividend of 0.2 shares of Class B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common stock, resulting in our Sponsor and independent director nominees holding an aggregate of 10,350,000 Founders’ Shares, collectively. At December 31, 2019, our Sponsor and our three (3) independent directors (the “Initial Stockholders”) held, collectively, 10,350,000 Founders’ Shares.
 
On April 17, 2018 (the “IPO Closing Date”), we consummated our initial public offering (our “Public Offering”) of 41,400,000 units, representing a complete exercise of the over-allotment option, at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of $414,000,000 before underwriting discounts and expenses. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock (each, a “Public Share”) of the Company at $0.0001 par value and one half of one warrant (a “Unit”). Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 (a “Warrant”). Only whole Warrants may be exercised; no fractional Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Warrants may be traded. Each Warrant will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of an initial Business Combination or 12 months from the IPO Closing Date and will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Alternatively, if we do not complete a Business Combination by May 21, 2020, the Warrants will expire at the end of such period. If we are unable to deliver registered shares of Class A common stock to the holder upon exercise of Warrants issued in connection with the 41,400,000 Units during the exercise period, the Warrants will expire, except to the extent they may be exercised on a cashless basis in the circumstances described in the agreement governing the Warrants.
 
On the IPO Closing Date, our Sponsor purchased from us an aggregate of 10,280,000 private placement warrants at $1.00 per private placement warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $10,280,000 in a private placement (the “Private Placement Warrants”). Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, and are not redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers of the Private Placement Warrants or their permitted transferees. We received gross proceeds from our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants of $414,000,000 and $10,280,000, respectively, for an aggregate of $424,280,000. We deposited $414,000,000 of the gross proceeds in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the “Trust Account”). The proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of one hundred eighty (180) days or less or in money market funds that meet certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Act of 1940 and invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. At the IPO Closing Date, the remaining $10,280,000 was held outside of the Trust Account, of which $8,280,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts and $200,000 was used to repay notes payable to our Sponsor with the balance reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. A portion of interest income on the funds held in the Trust Account has been and will continue to be released to us to pay our tax obligations and up to $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support.

On April 12, 2018, HPEP I, an affiliate of our Sponsor, entered into a forward purchase agreement (the “Forward Purchase Agreement”) with us that provides for the purchase by HPEP I of an aggregate of up to 15,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock (the “Forward Purchase Shares”) and up to 7,500,000 warrants for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, for an aggregate purchase price of up to $150,000,000 in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of our initial Business Combination (the “Forward Purchase Securities”). At or prior to closing of the Business Combination, HPEP I may assign its rights and obligations under the Forward Purchase Agreement to one or more third parties, which may include HighPeak Energy Partners II, LP (“HPEP II”) and HighPeak Energy Partners III, LP (“HPEP III”), and we will assign our rights and obligations under the Forward Purchase Agreement to HighPeak Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“HighPeak Energy”) and the parties will amend the Forward Purchase Agreement to, among other things, provide for the sale and purchase of shares of common stock and warrants of HighPeak Energy instead of us and reduce the number of warrants received by the purchasers under the Forward Purchase Agreement from up to 7,500,000 warrants to up to 5,000,000 warrants, in each case, pursuant to an amendment to the Forward Purchase Agreement (the “Forward Purchase Agreement Amendment”), which the HPK Business Combination Agreement (as defined below) contemplates will be entered into at the closing. At the closing, the warrants, if sold pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement Amendment (the “forward purchase warrants”), will have the same terms as the Private Placement Warrants so long as they are held by the purchasers under the Forward Purchase Agreement Amendment, their affiliates or their permitted transferees, and the Forward Purchase Shares are identical to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units sold in our Public Offering, except the Forward Purchase Shares will, when issued, be subject to transfer restrictions and certain registration rights, as described in the Forward Purchase Agreement Amendment. The purchaser’s commitment under the Forward Purchase Agreement Amendment may be reduced under certain circumstances as described in the agreement.
 
On May 25, 2018, we announced that the holders of our Units may elect to separately trade the Public Shares and Warrants included in the Units commencing on May 29, 2018 on The Nasdaq Capital Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbols “PACQ” and “PACQW,” respectively. Those Units not separated continue to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “PACQU.”
 
On October 10, 2019, our stockholders approved an extension of the date by which we must consummate an initial Business Combination (the “February Extension”) from October 17, 2019 to February 21, 2020 (the “February Extended Date”). We requested the February Extension in order to consummate an initial Business Combination. In connection with the February Extension, 3,594,000 shares of Class A common stock were redeemed on October 11, 2019, for a total value of $36,823,301, and 248,000 public warrants were tendered and accepted for payment on October 16, 2019 by our Sponsor.

Further, our Sponsor has agreed to loan, or cause an affiliate to loan, us or one of our subsidiaries an amount equal to $0.033 for each share of Class A common stock issued in our Public Offering that was not redeemed in connection with the stockholder vote to approve the February Extension for each month (commencing on October 17, 2019 and on the 17th day of each subsequent calendar month) that is needed by us to complete the initial Business Combination from October 17, 2019 until February 21, 2020.

The Second Extension Payment will not be credited against the cash price to be paid to Grenadier upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Grenadier Amendment and the obligation to pay the Second Extension Payment will survive any termination of the Grenadier Amendment in advance of any such closing. For more information regarding the HighPeak Business Combination (defined below) and the Business Combination Agreement Amendments, please read the registration statement on Form S-4 originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) by HighPeak Energy on December 2, 2019, as amended on January 10, 2020 (the “Registration Statement”), and the Current Report on Form 8-K originally filed with the SEC by the Company on February 7, 2020, including the complete text of the HPK Business Combination Agreement and the Business Combination Agreement Amendments.

Potential Conflicts
 
Each of our officers and our directors other than our independent directors is an officer and/or director of our Sponsor and/or an affiliated company. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with or from a company affiliated with, or involving properties operated by, our Sponsor or its affiliates or its officers or directors, nor are we prohibited from entering into an agreement with our Sponsor or its affiliates or a company affiliated with our officers or directors with respect to the operation of any properties we acquire in connection with the initial Business Combination. In the event we seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that our initial Business Combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view. Through their direct or indirect interest in a HighPeak affiliated company, members of our management team currently own an indirect interest in us. Each member of our management team may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Business Combination.
 
All of the members of our management team are employed by a HighPeak affiliate and are direct investors in a HighPeak affiliate. HighPeak is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a Business Combination. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such other entity. We do not believe, however, the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our Business Combination. In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an affiliated joint acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation, including a HighPeak affiliate. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial Business Combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a specified future issuance to any such entity. Our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, dated as of April 10, 2018, as amended by that certain Certificate of Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, effective as of April 12, 2018, as further amended by that certain Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, effective as of February 20, 2020 (collectively, our “Charter”), provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to our Sponsor or its affiliates or our non-employee directors or their affiliates unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.

Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial Business Combination or we have failed to complete our initial Business Combination by the Extended Date.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds in the Trust Account of approximately $372.4 million at February 29, 2020 available to use for a Business Combination (assuming no stockholder seeks conversion of their shares or seeks to sell their shares to us in any tender offer in relation to such Business Combination), we offer a target business a variety of options, such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial Business Combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination financing available that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available to us.
Conversion Rights for Public Stockholders
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial Business Combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two (2) business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our Class A common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
 
Our Charter does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (such that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). As a result, we may be able to complete our Business Combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not consummate the Business Combination or redeem any shares, all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate Business Combination. Our Sponsor and our officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any Founders’ Shares or Class A common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our Public Offering or purchased by them in our Public Offering, or in the aftermarket.
 
We may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System (the “DWAC System”), at the holder’s option, in each case, prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the Business Combination.

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed Business Combination and the proposed Business Combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until two (2) business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the Business Combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial Business Combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed Business Combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures historically used by some blank check companies. Traditionally, to perfect conversion rights in connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his conversion rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver their certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert their shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Once made, any request to convert such shares, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed Business Combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a Public Share of Class A common stock delivered their certificate in connection with an election of its conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he or she may simply request the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account as of two (2) business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Under our Charter, we have until May 21, 2020 to complete an initial Business Combination. If we have not completed an initial Business Combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable and up to $50,000 for dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed they will not propose any amendment to our Charter that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a Business Combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date unless (i) we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of Class A common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares and (ii) our Sponsor or an affiliate offers to purchase, at $1.00 per public Warrant (exclusive of commissions), the then outstanding public Warrants in a tender offer, as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These rights shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding Public Shares in the event we do not consummate our initial Business Combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six (6) years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three (3) years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including any interest but net of franchise and income taxes payable and up to $50,000 for dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following the Extended Date, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten (10) years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.

We are required to use our reasonable best efforts to have all third parties (other than our independent auditors) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood any claim would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account. We therefore believe any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you of this fact as there is no guarantee vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the Trust Account. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the Trust Account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount in the Trust Account, inclusive of any interest, plus any remaining net assets (subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described herein).
 
Our Sponsor has agreed it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or by a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.00 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our Company. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
We anticipate notifying the trustee of the Trust Account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than ten (10) business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the Founders’ Shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to such Founders’ Shares. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our warrants, which will expire. We will pay any additional liquidation costs from our remaining assets outside of the Trust Account. If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our Public Offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
 
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only in the event of our failure to complete a Business Combination within the required time period, if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a Business Combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our Charter prior to consummating an initial Business Combination. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us and is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.
 
Tender Offer for Public Warrants by our Sponsor or an Affiliate
 
Our Sponsor has committed to offer or cause an affiliate to offer to purchase, at $1.00 per public Warrant (exclusive of commissions), the outstanding public Warrants in a tender offer that would commence after our announcement of an initial Business Combination and occur in connection with such Business Combination. The warrant tender offer would not be conditioned upon any minimum number of Warrants being tendered.
 
   10

  

Our Sponsor has also committed to offer or cause an affiliate to offer to purchase, at $1.00 per public Warrant (exclusive of commissions), the outstanding public Warrants in a tender offer that would commence after our filing of a proxy statement or information statement with respect to a proposed amendment to our Charter that would affect the substance of timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete a Business Combination by the Extended Date. Any such purchases would occur in connection with the effectiveness of such amendment.
 
An affiliate of our Sponsor has deposited cash funds equal to $20,700,000 with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The funds held in the escrow account may be used to pay $1.00 per Warrant to holders of public Warrants (excluding Private Placement Warrants or forward purchase warrants) that tender in the tender offer for the public Warrants. At any time, our Sponsor or its affiliate may substitute a letter of credit from a financially capable bank in good standing in lieu of cash or cash in lieu of a letter of credit. Neither funds in the escrow account nor the letter of credit shall be held in trust nor comprise any portion of any pro-rata distribution of our Trust Account. In the event a Business Combination is announced and a tender offer for the Warrants is made, but the Business Combination is later abandoned, the tender offer will not be closed, and the Warrants will be returned to the holders.
 
HPEP II, HighPeak Energy Partners GP II, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“HPEP II GP”), and Jack Hightower (together with HPEP II, HPEP II GP and our Sponsor, the “Offerors”), commenced: (i) an initial warrant tender offer on September 13, 2019, to purchase 20,700,000 public Warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per Public Warrant in connection with a special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders held on October 10, 2019, to approve, among other matters, an amendment to the Company’s charter extending the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from October 17, 2019 to February 21, 2020 (ii) a second warrant tender offer on December 4, 2019, to purchase the 20,452,000 public Warrants not held by the Offerors at a purchase price of $1.00 per Public Warrant in connection with the Company’s announcement of its entry into the HighPeak Business Combination on November 27, 2019 and (iii) a third warrant tender offer on February 7, 2020 to purchase the 3,158,195 public Warrants not held by the Offerors at a purchase price of $1.00 per Public Warrant in connection with a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders held on February 20, 2020, to approve an amendment to the Company’s charter extending the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from February 21, 2020 to May 21, 2020.
 
In the event that we are unable to consummate a Business Combination by May 21, 2020, the escrow agent will be authorized to transfer $1.00 per whole public Warrant, to holders of public Warrants other than our Sponsor and its affiliates, at the same time as we redeem our Public Shares, and all public Warrants will expire worthless.
 
Following the tender offer or payment to holders of public Warrants described above, any amounts remaining in the escrow account will be returned to our Sponsor or its affiliate.
 
Our Charter
 
Our Charter contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our Public Offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial Business Combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our Charter that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a Business Combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not consummate a Business Combination by the Extended Date, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their Public Shares in connection with any such vote. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any Founders’ Shares and any Public Shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend Charter and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our Charter provides, among other things, that:

● | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | we will consummate our initial Business Combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial Business Combination is not consummated by the Extended Date, we will redeem all of the outstanding Public Shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our Company;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not consummate any other Business Combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial Business Combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial Business Combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the Trust Account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in our Public Offering on an initial Business Combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Facilities
 
We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 421 W. 3rd Street, Suite 1000, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the Business Combination and the stage of the Business Combination process the Company is in. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a Business Combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our Units, Class A common stock and Warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and, as a result, we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors. We do not maintain an Internet site in our name; however, the SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to the uniform resource locators (“URLs”) for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), or International Financing Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”).
 
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2019 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer as of December 31, 2019, we will be required to have our internal control procedures audited beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such target business to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete a Business Combination with such a target business.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the IPO Closing Date, or (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (2) the date on which (a) we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, or (b) we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
