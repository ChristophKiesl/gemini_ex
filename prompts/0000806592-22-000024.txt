ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
We sell stevioside, a natural sweetener, and other pharmaceutical products. Substantially all of our operations are located in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC"). We have built an integrated company with the sourcing and production capabilities designed to meet the needs of our customers. Our operations are organized into two operating segments related to our product lines:
 

- | Stevioside; and 
--+---------------------
- | Corporate and other.

STEVIOSIDE SEGMENT
 
In our Stevioside segment, we produce and sell a variety of purified steviol glycosides with rebaudioside A and stevioside as the principal components, an all natural, low calorie sweetener, and OnlySweet, a stevioside based table top sweetener. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, our Stevioside segment generated revenues of $34.8 million and $25.0 million, representing 99% and 98% of our total consolidated revenues, respectively.
 
The stevia glycosides are extracted from the leaves of the stevia rebaudiana plant of the Aster/Chrysanthemum family. The sweetness of the stevia leaves is caused by eight glycosides contained within the leaves including stevioside, rebaudioside A, C, D, E and F, steviolbioside and dulcoside A. Stevioside is the most abundant of these components and the main cause for the sweetness of the stevia leaves. Stevioside, rebaudiosides A and C as well as dulcoside A are known as the four most important steviol glycosides. Rebaudioside A is the sweetest and least bitter ingredient among the four. The higher purity of rebaudioside A brings better sensory attributes of the sweetener products.
 
The leaves of the stevia rebaudiana plant have been used for centuries to sweeten bitter beverages and to make tea in the plant's native Paraguay. Stevia is grown commercially in Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Central America, Israel, Thailand and China. The stevia rebaudiana plant was first introduced to China in 1977 and commercial harvesting of stevia started in the mid-1980's. There are two major species of stevia grown in China; one was cultivated by Chinese researchers and another was introduced from Japan. Most stevioside produced in China is exported throughout Asia, primarily to Japan and South Korea; meanwhile Chinese domestic market demand is also gradually building up in recent years.
 
Worldwide use of Stevioside and Related Approvals
 
Stevioside is a safe and natural alternative to sugar for people needing low sugar or low calorie diets. Stevioside can be used to replace sugar in beverages and foods, including those that require baking or cooking where man-made chemical based sweetener replacements are not suitable. Stevioside may be used in a wide variety of consumer products including soft drinks, vegetable products, tabletop sweeteners, confectioneries, fruit products and processed seafood products in the United States, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Israel, Germany, France, Brazil, Paraguay, Malaysia, Russia, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand. 
 
We believe worldwide demand for alternative sweeteners, such as our stevia based products, will increase as more countries permit the use of stevioside as a food additive. Stevioside has been sanctioned by the Ministry of Health of China to be used as a food additive, and is listed in the Sanitation Standard of Food Additives.
 

In furtherance of our efforts to move toward production of organic, all natural and low calorie products and to enhance our international position and market penetration as a stevia producer along with our distribution partners around the world, we underwent an extensive audit in 2011 by CERES GmbH, an international organization that specializes in inspection and certification in the areas of organic farming and food processing. Upon completion of their audit in November 2011, CERES GmbH notified us that our stevia extracts production process had been certified organic and free of synthetic chemical inputs and uses clean and sanitized procedures that avoid chemical contamination under standards established by the USDA National Organic Program and European Commission (EC) 834/2007 and EC 889/2008.

In fiscal 2022, we have obtained new certification of National Organic Program (NOP Certificate No: C8461, including the USDA Organic Certification with number of certification: CO-302076 and NASAA Organic Certification for EU) and certification of non-genetically modified organisms ("Non-GMO") with the ID number of C-253537-2021 for Enzymatically Treated Stevia Extract, C-253539-2021 for Organic Enzymatically Treated Stevia Extract, C-253538-2021 for Organic Rebaudioside A 98%, C-253536-2021 for Organic Stevia Extract and C-253540-2021 for Stevia Extract. NOP is the federal regulatory framework governing organic food. Certification is handled by state, non-profit and private agencies that have been approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). NOP regulations cover in detail all aspects of food production, processing, delivery and retail sale. Under the NOP, farmers and food processors, who wish to use the word "organic" in reference to their businesses and products, must be certified organic. A USDA Organic seal identifies products with at least 95% organic ingredients. In addition, we also maintained our Halal Certification (No: 0549180200), our Food Safety System Certification (FSSC) 22000 Certification, and our ISO 22000:2018 and ISO/TS22002-1:2009 Certifications. We will continue to put effort into maintaining and obtaining additional certification as an assurance to our customers of our product quality and safety.
 
Steviosin
 
Steviosin is a natural low calorie stevia extract for medicinal use, containing stevioside at 90% with the total steviol glycosides meeting or exceeding 95% on a dry weight basis. Steviosin is used as an alternative sweetener in the pharmaceutical production in China.
 
OnlySweet
 
OnlySweet is an all natural, zero calorie, tabletop sweetener comprised of three natural ingredients, including stevioside. In June 2008 we began production of a new blend of OnlySweet increasing its sweetness. We believe this OnlySweet formulation represented a significant advancement in quality resulting in a sweeter and more natural taste compared to other manufacturers of stevioside based sweeteners. We believe consumers are attracted to these improvements in taste, absence of aftertaste and overall mouth feel of this new blend of OnlySweet. OnlySweet is manufactured in the United States at an FDA approved blending facility.
 
Our Customers
 
The majority of our stevioside is sold on a wholesale basis to domestic food and drug manufacturers and ingredient distributor of foreign trade companies. Our top 10 customers accounted for 71.3% and 69.9% of our sales in the Stevioside segment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our biggest customers, Qufu Shengwang Import and Export Trade Co., Ltd, accounted for 43.4% and 32.7%, respectively, of our stevioside sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not have long term supply agreements with our customers and sales are generally made under a purchase order arrangement. The payment terms are generally 60 to 90 days after receipt of products. We control the default risk by conducting due diligence on the customers' credit record before acceptance of a purchase order.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials - Stevioside
 
The Shandong Province is a primary harvesting base of stevia leaves as well as the main region for the production of stevioside in China. We purchase all raw materials directly from local suppliers at market prices and pay for the leaves at the time of purchase. We test stevia leaves prior to purchase in an effort to maintain quality control. Our internal policy is to purchase leaves with stevioside content in excess of 9%.
 
Due to the effect of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the sourcing and availability of stevia raw material to have increased difficulties and costs for fiscal 2022 and 2023. February to March is normally the nursing period for stevia plants; as a result of COVID-19 related gathering laws, the farmers are not able to have the same amount of nursery workers as previous years, resulting in a decrease of stevia plants and product yield. Relevant safety measures also resulted in an increase of general plantation costs. We predict this will cause a shortage of stevia leaves harvest this year and along with the effect of the rain season, we expect to see an increase in our cost of raw material.
 
Manufacturing, Extraction and Packaging
 
We have been engaged in the continuous production of stevioside since 1998. We use a traditional extraction technology process known as "aqueous extraction" which involves the use of purified water extraction and air dehydration to produce stevioside. The extraction process for stevioside generally takes seven days. The plant leaves are first dried and then inspected to insure quality leaves are used in the extraction process. We then use a combined process involving a solid/liquid extraction procedure, followed by a liquid-purifying step that is traditionally used to extract the stevioside from the stevia leaves. This all natural method results in a pure white stevia crystal, with no brownish coloring. Once the extraction process has been completed, the final product is ready for packaging and shipment to our customers.

Over the years, we have received many certifications and recognition for our effort, including Certificate of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), ISO and HACCP certifications, etc. which is an indication of our commitment to quality, safety and continuous improvement. In an effort to meet the international food safety standards mandated by larger consumer product companies that we expect to target as customers, we have also made capital investments to enhance our manufacturing facilities, equipment and documentation systems, changed certain manufacturing processes and carried out additional personnel training in order to meet these standards.  
 
In December 2012, Qufu Shengren finished the construction of a new stevia extraction line in the same location of its current stevioside manufacturing facility. This line facility applies a new stevia extraction technology to produce both high and low grade stevioside. The annual production capacity of this line facility is 500 metric tons including 300 metric tons of high purity Rebaudioside A products and 200 metric tons of low purity Rebaudioside A product.
 
In the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 and 2022, we have invested a total of $1.2 million for the two years, to purchase new manufacturing equipment for our facility with annual capacity of 500 metric tons in order to meet substantially increased demand for its high-grade stevia products. 
 
As of now, Sunwin Stevia has approximately 1,700 metric tons of manufacturing capacity per year to produce stevia extract. With these manufacturing facilities, Sunwin Stevia is able to deliver stevia products containing Rebaudioside A in a range of 50% to 99% with a format of powder, granular, or tablet. We set our production schedules based on the market demands and our capacity.
 
Competition
 
There are approximately 30 stevioside manufacturers operating on a continuing basis in China. While these competitors have production capacity similar to ours, we believe we are able to compete effectively with them based on our production efficiency and product quality. In addition, other companies periodically enter the market depending upon demand. These intermittent producers may choose to stop production when raw materials are not readily available in the marketplace. The sporadic oversupply of product from these competitors can adversely affect our market share. Furthermore, if demand wanes these competitors may reduce the price of their products, which can adversely affect market prices. In addition to competing with other Chinese companies, we also compete with foreign growers and processors.
 
We are one of the few steviosin manufacturers that are GMP certified and granted with a drug approval number. We believe that the combination of eligibility to supply pharmaceutical ingredients and capability for stevia extraction provides us with a competitive advantage compared to our competitors, most of whom are either not eligible to supply pharmaceutical ingredients or not experienced in large-scale stevia extraction.
 
CORPORATE AND OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENT
 
Since fiscal 2018 we invested in a new production line for Metformin as one of the new product markets we intend to branch into. Metformin is the raw material of Metformin hydrochloride tablets. Metformin is the first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, particularly in people who are not satisfied with simple diet control, especially those with obesity and hyperinsulinemia. This drug not only has a hypoglycemic effect, but also may have the effect of reducing body weight and hyperinsulinemia. It can be effective in patients with poor efficacy of certain sulfonylureas, such as sulfonylureas, intestinal glycosidase inhibitors or thiazolidinedione hypoglycemic agents. On July 10, 2019, the Company entered into the Metformin Production Line Operation Management Agreement with an unaffiliated individual to operate the Metformin production line.
NEW PRODUCT AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
 
We continue to engage in new product and technology developments through our internal research facilities, industry consultants and specialists to provide research and development for the planting of stevia plants, the development of biological methods to improve lower-grade stevia product to higher grade stevia and applying biological method to change the taste of stevia to meet market demand.
 
In October 2019, we invested in a new pressure spray tower which allows for our enzyme treated stevia to be produced as a granulated product instead of powder product, this reduced dusting issues and improved its water solubility. We installed new and improved resin and membrane separation equipment for this production line, which further removed any impurity in the taste of this product. Our enzyme treated stevia has a sweetness of 260 times the sweetness of cane sugar, with the improvements the taste is also very close to cane sugar with very minimal aftertaste or bitterness. We are now also able to extract the all-natural R&D element from the stevia leaves at a concentration of 95% or above. We believe these products will be greatly accepted by our clients who are used to the taste of cane sugar.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property which includes various raw materials purification technologies used in our products. We have received a trademark from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office covering the trade name "OnlySweet", which we are using for the North American distribution of our stevia based tabletop sweetener product.
 
To protect our proprietary rights outside the PRC we generally rely on confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, such as with consultants, vendors and customers, although we have not signed such agreements in every case. We do not have any similar agreements with any of our employees or consultants in the PRC, we aim to correct this deficiency in the near future. Despite such protections, a third party could, without authorization, utilize our propriety technologies without our consent. In the past, three of our products have been copied by our competitors. We can give no assurance that our agreements with employees, consultants and others who participate in the production of our products will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our proprietary technologies will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Our business and operations are primarily located in the PRC. We are subject to state and local environmental laws related to certification of water release. We are subject to registration and inspection by the State Food and Drug Administration of China ("SFDA") with respect to the manufacturing and distribution of steviosides. In addition, we are licensed by the Shandong Provincial Government to manufacture stevioside. We believe we are in compliance with all provisions of those registrations, inspections and licenses and have no reason to believe that they will not be renewed as required by the applicable rules of the Central Government and the Shandong Province. In addition, our operations must conform to general governmental regulations and rules for private (non-state owned) companies doing business in China. 
 
The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to various federal and state regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"); the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.
 
Compliance with applicable federal and state regulations is essential to our business. Although we believe that we are in compliance with applicable regulations, should the FDA or any state in which we operate amend its guidelines or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations, we may not be able to comply with these new guidelines. Such regulations could require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, market withdrawal or discontinuation of certain products we are unable to reformulate, imposition of additional record keeping requirements, expanded documentation regarding the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling and/or additional scientific substantiation. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the manufacturers of any of our products, including but not limited to fines, injunctions, product recalls, seizures and criminal prosecution.
 
The FDCA generally regulates ingredients added to foods and requires that such ingredients making up a food product are themselves safe for their intended uses.  In this regard, when a company adds an ingredient to a food, the FDCA generally requires that the ingredient either be determined by the company to be generally regarded as safe by qualified experts or go through FDA's review and approval process as a food additive.
 
PRC Legal System
 
Despite efforts to develop its legal system over the past several decades, including but not limited to legislation dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, the PRC continues to lack a comprehensive system of laws. Further, the laws that do exist in the PRC are often vague, ambiguous and difficult to enforce, which could negatively affect our ability to do business in China and compete with other companies in our segments.
 
In September 2006, the Ministry of Commerce ("MOFCOM") promulgated the Regulations on Foreign Investors' Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises (M&A Regulations) in an effort to better regulate foreign investment in China. The M&A Regulations were adopted in part as a needed codification of certain joint venture formation and operating practices, and also in response to the government's increasing concern about protecting domestic companies in perceived key industries and those associated with national security, as well as the outflow of well-known trademarks, including traditional Chinese brands.

As a U.S. based company doing business in China, we seek to comply with all PRC laws, rules and regulations and pronouncements, and endeavor to obtain all necessary approvals from applicable PRC regulatory agencies such as the MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ("SAFE").
 
Currency
 
 The value of the Renminbi ("RMB"), the main currency used in China, fluctuates and is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar have generally been based on rates set by the People's Bank of China, which are set daily based on the previous day's interbank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates on the world financial markets.
OUR CORPORATE HISTORY
 
We were incorporated in Nevada in August 1987 under the name Network USA, Inc. for the purposes of completing a merger or other business combination with an operating entity. Effective on April 30, 2004, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sunwin Tech from its stockholders in exchange for approximately 17,000,000 shares of our common stock which resulted in a change of control of our company. Prior to our acquisition of Sunwin Tech, effective February 1, 2004, Sunwin Tech acquired 80% of Qufu Natural Green from Pharmaceutical Corporation, a company controlled by Mr. Laiwang Zhang, our former President and Chairman.
 
In July 2004 following the transaction with Sunwin Tech Group Inc., we changed the name of our company from Network USA, Inc. to Sunwin International Neutraceuticals, Inc. and in April 2012, we changed our company name to Sunwin Stevia International, Inc. to better indicate our business and focus. 
 
In February 2006, we acquired the remaining 20% of Qufu Natural Green. On November 18, 2008, Qufu Natural Green completed its acquisition of 60% interest of Qufu Shengwang. In March 2009, Qufu Natural Green completed its acquisition of 100% interest of Qufu Shengren.
 
On October 9, 2019, Qufu Shengren invested RMB2,000,000 (approximately $288,000) in a new entity, Qufu Shengren Import and Export Co., Ltd., (“Qufu Shengren Import and Export”), a Chinese limited liability company, a 100% owned subsidiary of Qufu Shengren. Qufu Shengren Import and Export focuses on the export of our Stevia products, and the import and export of technology and other relevant products; we expect to increase operations in this subsidiary in the near future.
 
In April 2020, the Company increased the operating capital of Qufu Shengren from the original RMB 19,680,000 (approximately $2,800,000) to RMB183,000,000 (approximately $26,000,000). The increase of capital will come from additional funding of RMB 92,470,000 (approximately $13,100,000) from Qufu Natural Green, and RMB70,850,000 (approximately $10,000,000) debt to equity conversion of multiple creditors. As the result, the Company owned 61.3% equity ownership of Qufu Shengren, and Shangdong Yulong Mining Group Co., Ltd. ("Yulong") and the individual investor owned 38.4% and 0.3% equity ownership of Qufu Shengren, respectively.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of June 30, 2022, we have 242 full time employees. The number of employees excludes employees of discontinued operations. All of our employees are primarily based in Qufu, China while some managerial and sales staff occasionally work in other Chinese cities or overseas on different projects. Each full-time Chinese employee is a member of a local trade union. Labor relations have remained positive and we have not had any employee strikes or major labor disputes. Unlike trade unions in western countries, trade unions in most parts of China are organizations mobilized jointly by the government and the management of the corporation.
