General 
We are a leading genomic diagnostics company that is fundamentally improving patient care by resolving diagnostic uncertainty with evidence that is trustworthy and actionable. Our products uniquely combine genomic technology, clinical science and machine learning to provide answers that give physicians and patients a clear path forward without risky, costly surgery that is often unnecessary. 
Our vision is to lead a transformation of diagnostics with a new genomic standard of truth. Our goal is to drive shareholder value by improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of healthcare.
The role of genomic information in medical practice is evolving rapidly and has affected the diagnosis of disease as well as treatment decisions. Over the past decade, molecular diagnostic tests that analyze genomic material from surgical tissue samples have emerged as an important complement to evaluations performed by pathologists. Information at the molecular level enables one to understand more fully the makeup and specific subtype of disease to improve diagnosis. In many cases, the genomic information derived from these samples can help guide treatment decisions as part of the standard of care. 
While genomic and technological advances are fueling the imagination about what is possible in medicine, we remain focused on delivering tests that change clinical decision making and improve patient outcomes. 
We deploy machine learning methods and RNA expression to improve diagnostic clarity for cancer and other diseases. In our thyroid and lung cancer indications, diagnosis can be ambiguous in approximately 15-70% of patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation. Our tests provide clarity of diagnosis that can in turn guide treatment decisions in approximately half of those cases, eliminating costly, risky surgeries and other unnecessary medical procedures, improving the lives of patients and saving the healthcare system money. 
Since our founding in 2008, we have commercialized three genomic tests that we believe are transforming diagnostics: the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier, or GEC, for thyroid cancer; the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier for lung cancer; and the Envisia Genomic Classifier for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. Collectively, we believe these three tests address a $2 billion global market opportunity.
Patients typically access our tests through their physician during the diagnostic process. All of our testing services are made available through our clinical reference laboratories located in San Francisco, California and Austin, Texas, which are each certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA.
The published evidence supporting our tests demonstrates the robustness of our science and clinical studies. Patients and physicians can access our full list of publications on our website. Nearly 30 clinical studies covering our products have been published, including two landmark clinical validation papers published in The New England Journal of Medicine. We continue to build upon our extensive library of clinical evidence. We also expect to continue expanding our offerings in thyroid cancer, lung cancer and interstitial lung diseases such as IPF, as well as other cancer indications that we believe will benefit from our technology and approach. 
We believe our focus on developing clinically useful tests that change patient care is enabling the company to set new standards in genomic test reimbursement. Our flagship product, the Afirma GEC, is now covered for more than 200 million people in the U.S. for use in thyroid cancer diagnosis and our second commercial product, the Percepta classifier, is the first genomic test to gain Medicare coverage for improved lung cancer screening and diagnosis.

Our Products
We strive to develop and commercialize products that become the standard of care. Since our founding in 2008 we have commercialized three products:
Afirma Thyroid FNA Analysis - The center piece of our Afirma solution is the Afirma GEC, which employs a proprietary 142-gene signature to determine whether thyroid nodules previously classified by cytopathology as indeterminate can be reclassified as benign, thus enabling the patient to avoid an unnecessary surgery. An additional 25 genes are used to differentiate uncommon neoplasm subtypes. The Afirma GEC was the first product of its kind to market and we believe it is the clear market leader in its indication.
Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier - The 23-gene Percepta classifier improves lung cancer screening and diagnosis by identifying patients at low risk of cancer among those whose lung nodules are not clearly benign or malignant following traditional evaluation. The test analyzes genomic changes that occur in the epithelial cells lining the airways of current or former smokers to assess a patient’s risk of having lung cancer, without the need to test the often-hard-to-reach nodule directly. The Percepta classifier is the first product of its kind to market and the first to obtain Medicare coverage for the improved screening and diagnosis of lung cancer.
Envisia Genomic Classifier - Commercialized in October 2016, the Envisia classifier is designed to improve physicians’ ability to differentiate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, from other interstitial lung diseases, or ILD, without the need for invasive and potentially risky surgery. The Envisia classifier uses machine learning coupled with powerful, deep RNA sequencing to detect the presence or absence of usual interstitial pneumonia, or UIP, a classic diagnostic pattern whose presence is essential for the diagnosis of IPF. The Envisia classifier is the first product of its kind to market and we expect it to gain Medicare coverage in 2018.
Our Pipeline 
We believe we have a rich pipeline to sustain long-term growth. We characterize the stages of a product’s development as progressing from discovery to development, to commercialization, to Medicare coverage and, finally, to private insurance coverage. The following pipeline describes internally developed products, product extensions and new indications. We also continue to evaluate acquisitions of intellectual property and corporate acquisitions that we believe answer the right clinical questions. 
Endocrinology

• | Enhanced Afirma GEC - We are developing a product enhancement to our current Afirma test, which we believe will maintain the Afirma GEC's high sensitivity and negative predictive value, while potentially further increasing the test's specificity and thus the number of benign surgeries that can potentially be avoided.


• | Risk of Recurrence - We are in the discovery phase for a risk of recurrence classifier.

Pulmonology 

• | Expanded Indications for the Percepta Classifier - We are evaluating enhancements to our product, which we envision would allow us to expand the intended use population for our test.


• | Nasal Classifier - We are in the discovery phase for a nasal test, based on our proprietary “field of injury” technology, that would potentially allow us to test patients at a different point in the clinical pathway of care.


• | Rx Response - We are in the discovery phase for a test that could help guide treatment decisions for IPF patients based upon their genomic profile.

Market Opportunity 
We believe diagnostic uncertainty is a critical healthcare issue that leads to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary surgeries, delayed or potentially harmful treatments and billions of wasted healthcare dollars each year. We believe that our three commercial tests address a $2 billion global market opportunity and that our markets are expanding due to increased screening or other market factors.

Thyroid Market Opportunity for Our Afirma Solution
Each year in the United States, we estimate that among the 525,000 patients who undergo a fine needle aspiration, or FNA, biopsy, 15 to 30 percent of results are inconclusive, or indeterminate, meaning not clearly benign or malignant. Historically, most of these patients were directed to thyroid surgery for a more definitive diagnosis. Following surgery, however, 70 to 80 percent of cases proved to be benign, meaning the surgery was unnecessary. We believe our Afirma test classifies approximately 50% of the indeterminate cases on which it is used as benign, thereby potentially enabling up to 80,000 surgeries to be avoided annually. 
We believe the addressable market opportunity for our Afirma solution is approximately $800 million globally, $500 million in the United States and $300 million internationally. We believe that we have penetrated approximately 25 to 30 percent of the United States thyroid FNA market for the Afirma GEC. We currently do not have meaningful operations or sales outside the United States. 
We announced in 2016 that we are working on an enhanced version of our Afirma GEC that we believe will further reduce unnecessary surgeries by reclassifying inconclusive biopsies as benign from 50% currently up to 70% while maintaining high sensitivity and negative predictive value, or NPV (i.e., probability that patients with a negative test result truly do not have thyroid cancer). 
Lung Cancer Market Opportunity for Our Percepta Classifier
Lung cancer is often difficult to diagnose without invasive, risky and costly surgeries. Approximately 225,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year in the U.S. and nearly 160,000 people die annually from lung cancer. We estimate that approximately 1.8 to 2.0 million lung nodules are identified in patients in the United States each year and that doctors perform approximately 350,000 bronchoscopies on these patients. A bronchoscopy is a non-surgical procedure that is often used to evaluate patients with potentially cancerous lung nodules. We estimate that approximately 140,000 of these patients have inconclusive bronchoscopy results and could potentially benefit from our test. We believe our Percepta product can classify approximately 44% of these patients as low risk or very low risk for lung cancer, saving approximately 60,000 patients from potentially having to undergo diagnostic surgeries.
We believe the addressable market opportunity for our Percepta product is approximately $425 million to $525 million in the United States and over $200 million in Europe. We anticipate the market will expand significantly over the coming years as lung cancer screening programs are implemented in the United States and physicians embrace bronchoscopy as a standard, less-invasive diagnostic modality for evaluating lung nodules and lesions. 
In February 2017, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor or MAC, issued a final coverage policy for the Percepta classifier under the Medicare MolDx program. The LCD makes the Percepta classifier the first genomic test to be covered by Medicare for improved lung cancer screening and diagnosis. The policy will become effective on March 13, 2017 and provides a framework for other MolDx-participating MACs to follow. CGS Administrators, LLC also issued a final LCD for the Percepta test and Noridian Healthcare Solutions is expected to similarly finalize its draft LCD. These final decisions will make the Percepta classifier a covered benefit for more than 35 million individuals, or nearly two thirds of the 57 million Medicare beneficiaries in the United States. We are currently building our commercial operations to support the commercialization of the Percepta classifier. 
IPF Market Opportunity for Our Envisia Classifier
Each year in the United States and Europe, up to 200,000 patients are suspected of having an ILD, including IPF, which is among the most common and deadly of these lung-scarring diseases. IPF is notoriously difficult to diagnose, often leading to treatment delays, repeated misdiagnoses, patient distress and added healthcare expense. Physicians routinely use high-resolution computed tomography imaging, or HRCT, to identify UIP, the pattern whose presence is essential to IPF diagnosis. This approach, however, frequently provides inconclusive results, leading many patients to require surgery to secure a more definitive diagnosis using surgical histopathology. These surgeries are risky and expensive, and many patients are too frail to undergo the procedure. Of the approximate 200,000 patients evaluated for ILD, we estimate that approximately 75% or 150,000 patients receive an uncertain diagnosis and are candidates for our Envisia test.
We believe the addressable market opportunity for our Envisia product is approximately $300 million to $350 million in the United States and over $200 million in Europe. We began making the Envisia classifier available to a limited number of institutions in December 2016 and plan to continue a controlled availability as we build the full package of clinical evidence to support Medicare reimbursement.

Scientific Background
In the past, clinicians made diagnoses from biopsy samples by looking at them under a microscope. Technology has advanced far beyond this, and scientists now have the ability to decipher genomic patterns that reside in the DNA and RNA of the biopsies we test. Ultimately, we search for patterns that tell us whether or not the biopsy contains the disease in question. We do this by using a whole-genome approach. This means we look at all of the human genes, including their expression patterns and their variants and mutations, rather than just looking at a few selected genes that we think may be important. This complex information requires computer-based algorithms to make sense of the patterns. This comprehensive measurement of the human genome allows us to detect signals from genes we may not have previously suspected to be involved in disease.
We use machine learning computer-based algorithms to match genomic patterns with clinical truth, or the true diagnosis. For example, when we train an algorithm on RNA sequencing data, we teach it to associate a set of expression patterns with disease and a different set of patterns with lack of disease. When algorithms are trained on enough examples with clinical truth, they learn to find that pattern in samples they have never encountered, thus allowing the algorithm to predict disease in a clinical setting. 
Our core products are built around algorithms that either rule-in or rule-out disease. Due to the complex, sometimes rare, subtypes of various diseases like cancer, we develop and train our machine learning algorithms using a diverse set of patient samples so that they are equipped to recognize patterns across the whole spectrum of conditions that may be encountered in the clinic.
Our process uses commercially available reagents and instruments with our own proprietary process and protocols, which results in RNA extraction from the range of biopsies used in our clinical development studies and our commercial laboratory tests.
Technology 
Our technology approach is comprised of a number of key attributes:
Core Expertise in Broad-based Genomic Analysis - Our team of bioinformatics and computational scientists possess extensive knowledge of both existing computational methods as well as the capacity to develop proprietary methods as needed for algorithm design. We demonstrated our ability to utilize large amounts of genomic data with machine learning algorithms in the development of the Afirma GEC on microarrays. We have extended this capability substantially by accessing genomic features through deep RNA sequencing. This allows us to use a combination of expression analysis as well as mutations and variants to build our sophisticated machine learning algorithms, all on the same platform.
Platform-Agnostic Approach - We are not reliant on any one technology platform to measure genomic signals; in fact, we may take advantage of a multitude of genomic methodologies to develop future tests. When we developed the Afirma GEC in 2008, microarray technologies were a cost-effective discovery technology compared to other approaches that were nascent at the time. More recently, the rapid cost reductions achieved in next generation sequencing platforms have allowed us to pursue our whole genome approach to biomarker discovery using a range of genomic features obtained through both DNA and RNA sequencing. From this vast array of sequence data, our algorithms select those genomic signals that inform on the disease in question, in the relevant biopsy sample. We continue to evaluate potential opportunities to use new genomic discoveries and technologies to further improve patient care.
Proprietary Capabilities in Analyzing Small, Heterogeneous Cytology Samples -  We have developed proprietary technology, intellectual property and know-how for optimized methods for extraction and analysis of nanogram quantities of RNA from small biopsy samples. Our focus is on redefining clinical truth, using patient samples obtained through less-invasive techniques, thereby increasing access to our technology by a larger patient population. While others can extract RNA from these small biopsies, we believe our process optimized and scaled for high-throughput clinical testing and large-scale clinical development studies, such as those involving amplification and hybridization to high-density microarrays. 
Precision and Reproducibility - We have in place standard operating procedures governing reagents, materials, instruments and controls and extensive experience from numerous verification studies performed for our tests. We apply the same high-quality control methods that were developed for our reagents and processes, along with our proprietary software for automation, sample tracking, data quality control and statistical analysis, to our development process.

Studies Validating Test Performance and Clinical Utility 
In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the “ACCE” model as a paradigm for establishing evidence to confirm the safety and effectiveness of molecular diagnostic tests. ACCE derives its name from the main criteria for evaluating such tests, including analytic validity, clinical validity and clinical utility. This model has been adopted by most technology assessment groups, professional societies and payers. We fully embrace this paradigm of evidence development and we strive to provide the highest level of scientific evidence to support our test claims. 
We believe that developing an extensive library of rigorous clinical evidence to support our tests is critical to driving inclusion in clinical guidelines, securing reimbursement and gaining physician adoption. We make our published research, abstracts from medical conferences and other product information available on our website at www.veracyte.com. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Afirma product is supported by more than 20 published scientific studies, including a prospective, multicenter clinical validation study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, which suggested that the test can reduce the number of unnecessary surgeries by 50 percent. The Afirma product is recommended in leading practice guidelines and is covered for over 200 million lives in the United States, including through Medicare and most commercial insurance plans.
Our Percepta test is supported by six published scientific studies, including data published in The New England Journal of Medicine, which demonstrate the test’s accuracy in identifying patients who are at low risk of cancer following inconclusive results from bronchoscopy. These patients may then be monitored with CT scans in lieu of undergoing surgery - a frequent next step at this juncture of the clinical pathway. A clinical utility study published in the journal CHEST suggested that use of the test may reduce unnecessary surgeries by 50 percent in the target patient population.
We continue to build our library of clinical evidence to support our Envisia product. Our test is supported by one clinical validation study with a second validation (manuscript) in process, one analytical validation study, and two clinical utility studies that demonstrate the unmet clinical need and potential utility of the test when used by subspecialty physicians. We plan to launch a prospective multicenter randomized trial to demonstrate the clinical utility of the test compared to the current standard of care. 
Commercial Operations 
Our commercial infrastructure, including our sales, marketing, managed care, and customer care functions, is critical to our ongoing success. We have built a strong domestic sales, marketing and reimbursement capability that interacts directly with users of our products, as well as payers and other stakeholders involved in the diagnostic workup of a patient. 
Our sales team is structured to sell all of our products; we do not maintain a separate sales force for each product. Currently, our sales force is comprised of our Product Specialists, who are accountable for select geographic territories; Institutional Channel Managers, who maintain and grow our relationships at multi-disciplinary hospital and integrated delivery network customers; Account Managers, who manage existing client relationships; and Clinical Science Specialists, who focus on addressing medical and clinical education in the field.

In September 2016, we terminated our U.S. co-promotion agreement with Genzyme Corporation, which we had entered in 2012. In anticipation of this event, we hired additional sales people and, as of December 31, 2016, we had 45 field sales people. In 2017, we expect to invest further in our sales force and to hire an additional 15-20 field sales people, mostly in the first half of the year. 
To date, substantially all of our revenue has been derived from customers we serve in the United States. Through December 31, 2016, we derived substantially all of our revenue from our Afirma solution, including cytopathology services and the Afirma GEC. 
Through third-party promotion agreements and distribution agreements, we entered the Brazil market in 2014 and the Israel, Middle East and North Africa markets in 2015. We do not expect meaningful revenue from international sales in the near future.
Industry trade shows or events provide us with an opportunity to make important product announcements, communicate directly with our clients and partners and to interact with key opinion leaders who impact our business. We typically attend a number of select industry conferences, including the Annual Meeting of the American Thyroid Association, or ATA; the Annual Scientific and Clinical Congress of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, or AACE; the Endocrine Society’s Annual Meeting, or ENDO; the American Thoracic Society’s International Conference, or ATS; and the American College of Chest Physician’s CHEST Annual Meeting.

Laboratory Operations 
We perform all of our genomic testing in our CLIA-certified laboratory in South San Francisco, California. We perform slide preparation and staining for cytopathology on fine needle aspiration, or FNA, samples in our CLIA certified laboratory in Austin, Texas. Our South San Francisco facility is responsible for quality assurance oversight, licensing and regulatory compliance and maintenance for both of our laboratories to ensure data integrity and consistent, validated processes.
We receive samples for testing directly from the following sources:
FNAs for Afirma GEC Only - Institutions and other clients, such as laboratories, that perform their own cytopathology may send us FNA samples from indeterminate results to perform the Afirma GEC. From time-to-time we refer to this as our “Afirma Diagnostic Partner” model. We receive about 15% of our FNA samples and over 50% of our Afirma GEC volume from this source and we believe it is the fastest-growing segment of our business. 
FNAs for Cytopathology and Reflexed Afirma GECs - About 85% of the FNA samples we receive from ordering physicians include the request for cytopathology assessment and if results are indeterminate, the Afirma GEC is to be performed. We partner with Thyroid Cytopathology Partners, or TCP, to perform the cytopathology review. Less than 50% of our Afirma GEC volume comes from this model. 
Bronchoscopy Samples for Percepta Classifier - Institutions and laboratories that perform their own cytopathology may send us samples collected during the bronchoscopy procedure and order genomic testing with the Percepta classifier when bronchoscopy results are inconclusive.
In 2016, we moved into a state-of-the-art laboratory space that we built out in South San Francisco, California. We believe that we have sufficient laboratory capacity to accommodate volume growth for our existing products and products in our pipeline.
We rely on TCP to provide professional cytopathology diagnoses on thyroid FNA samples pursuant to a pathology services agreement. TCP has the exclusive right to provide the cytopathology diagnoses on FNA samples that are referred to us at a fixed price per test with volume discounts. TCP can terminate the agreement upon our failure to pay any amounts due under the contract, and either we or TCP can terminate the agreement upon the insolvency of the other party, breach of the agreement by the other party, termination or breach of the service terms or the suspension or termination of the necessary regulatory licenses and approvals needed to perform the FNA diagnoses. TCP is co-located in a portion of our facilities in Austin, Texas and reimburses us for a portion of our actual out-of-pocket rental and related operating expense costs. Our agreement with TCP was effective until December 31, 2015 and thereafter automatically renews every year unless either party provides notice of intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the then-current term.
Our quality assurance function oversees the quality of our laboratories as well as the quality systems used in research and development, client services, billing operations and sales and marketing. We have an established quality management system compliant with federal and state regulations and standards that we believe achieves excellence in operations across the entire business. We continuously monitor and strive to improve our quality program and believe our implementation of these processes has supported our achievement of product performance, customer satisfaction and retention and a philosophy of continuous improvement.
Reimbursement Strategy 
We employ a multi-pronged strategy designed to achieve broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests:

• | Compile a Growing Library of Peer-reviewed Studies that Demonstrate the Test Is Effective - To date, several peer-reviewed articles and review papers have been published and have helped support our efforts aimed at widespread adoption and reimbursement of our genomic tests. In each disease area we pursue, we intend to conduct studies in order to develop robust library of evidence.


• | Meet the Evidence Standards Necessary to Be Consistent with Leading Clinical Guidelines - We believe inclusion in leading clinical practice guidelines plays an important role in payers' coverage decisions. For example, the data published on the Afirma GEC to date is consistent with the recommendations of the widely-recognized American Thyroid Association and National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines.

• | Execute an Internal Managed Care and Claims Adjudication Function as Part of Our Core Business Operations - We believe that obtaining adequate and widespread reimbursement is a critical factor in our long-term success. We employ a team of in-house claims processing and reimbursement specialists who work with payers, physician practices and patients to obtain maximum reimbursement.


• | Cultivate a Network of Key Opinion Leaders - Key opinion leaders are able to influence clinical practice by publishing research and determining whether new tests should be integrated into practice guidelines. We collaborate with key opinion leaders early in the development process to ensure our clinical studies are designed and executed in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefits of our tests to patients, physicians and payers. Ongoing studies to support real world experience with our tests are also a key component of our efforts to collaborate with physician thought leaders.


• | Established Payer Relationships and In-network Contracts - We believe that positive engagement with payers leads to coverage decisions and facilitates our efforts on coverage and contract decisions for subsequent tests.

Coverage, Coding and Reimbursement 
Revenue from our Afirma tests comes from several sources, including commercial third-party payers, such as insurance companies and health maintenance organizations, government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and patients. We believe that reimbursement for our lung products will be derived from similar sources, but with a greater proportion coming from Medicare and potentially Medicaid due to the older age of the target patient population.
We received Medicare coverage for our Afirma GEC in 2012 and since that time our Medicare rate has remained approximately $3,200 for our test. We bill payers directly for the Afirma GEC using a unique Current Procedural Terminology code, or CPT code 81545.
To date, a high percentage of FNA samples received are accessioned for cytopathology, for which we bill both the technical and professional component using established CPT codes. 
In February 2017, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor or MAC, issued a final coverage policy for our Percepta classifier through the Medicare MolDx program and CGS Administrators, LLC followed suit. We expect to receive a final coverage decision in the first half of 2017 from Noridian Healthcare Solutions, the remaining MAC that issued a draft local coverage policy for the test in 2016. We plan to bill payers directly for the Percepta classifier using a “miscellaneous” CPT code until we seek and obtain a specific code for the test.
We rely on a small number of third-party payers for a significant portion of our revenue, the loss of one or more of which would have a negative effect on our business. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, revenue was represented by the indicated percent for each payer: 

• | Medicare accounted for 27%, 26% and 26% of our revenue;


• | UnitedHealthcare accounted for 12%, 14% and 18% of our revenue; and


• | Aetna accounted for 8%, 9% and 11% of our revenue.

Competition 
We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets we target with our tests include:

• | the ability of the test to answer the appropriate clinical question at the right point in the clinical pathway;


• | the quality and strength of clinical validation and utility data;


• | confidence in diagnostic results backed by analytical verification data;


• | the extent of reimbursement and in-network payer contracts;


• | inclusion in practice guidelines;


• | cost-effectiveness; and


• | ease of use.

We believe we compete favorably on the factors described above with our Afirma solution and are positioning ourselves to compete effectively on these factors with our Percepta and Envisia classifiers.

Our principal competition for the Afirma GEC comes from traditional methods used by physicians to diagnose thyroid cancer. Physicians in the United States have historically recommended that patients with indeterminate diagnoses from cytopathology results be considered for surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid to rule out cancer. This practice has been the standard of care in the United States, as well as in many international markets, for many years, and we continue to educate physicians about the benefits of our test in order to change clinical practice.
We also face competition from companies and academic institutions that use next generation sequencing technology or other methods to measure mutational markers such as BRAF and KRAS, along with numerous other mutations. These organizations include Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc., Rosetta Genomics Ltd., and others who are developing new products or technologies that may compete with our tests. In the future, we may also face competition from companies developing new products or technologies.
With the Percepta and Envisia tests, we believe our primary competition will similarly come from traditional methods used by physicians to diagnose the related diseases. For the Percepta test, we expect competition from companies focused on lung cancer such as Integrated Diagnostics, Inc. We also anticipate facing potential competition from companies offering or developing approaches for assessing malignancy risk in patients with lung nodules using alternative samples, such as blood, urine or sputum. However, such "liquid biopsies" are often used earlier in the diagnostic paradigm—for instance, to screen for cancer—or to gauge risk of recurrence or response to treatment.
In general, we also face competition from commercial laboratories, such as Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and Sonic Healthcare USA with strong infrastructure to support the commercialization of diagnostic services. We face potential competition from companies such as Illumina, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., both of which have entered the clinical diagnostics market. Other potential competitors include companies that develop diagnostic products, such as Roche Diagnostics, a division of Roche Holding Ltd, Siemens AG and Qiagen N.V.
Competitors may develop their own versions of our solution in countries in which we do not have patents or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging the use of their solution by physicians in other countries.
Many of our potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop products with prices lower than ours, which could be viewed by physicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our solution, or offer solutions at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the list price of our solutions and affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to change clinical practice in a meaningful way or compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our products, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As we add new tests and services, we will face many of these same competitive risks for these new tests.
Regulation 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA
As a clinical reference laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Under CLIA, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations we perform and to comply with standards covering personnel, facilities administration, quality systems and proficiency testing.
We have current certificates under CLIA to perform testing at each of our locations. To renew our CLIA certificates, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. The regulatory and compliance standards applicable to the testing we perform may change over time, and any such changes could have a material effect on our business.
If one of our clinical reference laboratories is out of compliance with CLIA requirements, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, as well as directed plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties. We must maintain CLIA compliance and certification to be eligible to bill for diagnostic services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. If we were to be found out of compliance with CLIA requirements and subjected to sanction, our business could be harmed.
10

State Laboratory Licensing
California Laboratory Licensing
In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under CLIA, licensure is required and maintained for our South San Francisco clinical reference laboratory under California law. Such laws establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical reference laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, California laws mandate proficiency testing, which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory.
If our clinical reference laboratory is out of compliance with California standards, the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH, may suspend, restrict or revoke our license to operate our clinical reference laboratory, assess substantial civil money penalties, or impose specific corrective action plans. Any such actions could materially affect our business. We maintain a current license in good standing with CDPH. However, we cannot provide assurance that CDPH will at all times in the future find us to be in compliance with all such laws.
New York Laboratory Licensing
Our clinical reference laboratories are required to be licensed by New York, under New York laws and regulations before we receive specimens from New York State. The license establishes standards for:
quality management systems;
qualifications, responsibilities, and training;
facility design and resource management;
pre-analytic, analytic (including validation and quality control), and post-analytic systems; and
quality assessments and improvements.
New York law also mandates proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under New York state law, regardless of whether such laboratories are located in New York. If a laboratory is out of compliance with New York statutory or regulatory standards, the New York State Department of Health, or NYSDOH, may suspend, limit, revoke or annul the laboratory's New York license, censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties. Statutory or regulatory noncompliance may result in a laboratory's operator being found guilty of a misdemeanor under New York law. NYSDOH also must approve the LDT before the test is offered in New York; approval has been received for the Afirma GEC and the Percepta classifier. Should we be found out of compliance with New York laboratory standards of practice, we could be subject to such sanctions, which could harm our business. We maintain a current license in good standing with NYSDOH for our South San Francisco and Austin laboratories. We cannot provide assurance that the NYSDOH will at all times find us to be in compliance with applicable laws.
Other States' Laboratory Licensing
In addition to New York and California, other states including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, require licensing of out-of-state laboratories under certain circumstances. We have obtained licenses from states where we believe we are required to be licensed, and believe we are in compliance with applicable licensing laws.
From time to time, we may become aware of other states that require out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure in order to accept specimens from the state, and it is possible that other states do have such requirements or will have such requirements in the future. If we identify any other state with such requirements or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to comply with such requirements.
United States
Food and Drug Administration: Diagnostic Kits
Diagnostic kits, including collection systems, that are sold and distributed through interstate commerce are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. Devices subject to FDA regulation must undergo premarket review prior to commercialization unless the device is of a type exempted from such review. In addition, manufacturers of medical devices must comply with various regulatory requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and implementing regulations promulgated 
11

under that Act. Entities that fail to comply with FDA requirements may be subject to issuance of notice of observations, untitled or warning letters, and can be liable for criminal or civil penalties, such as recalls, import detentions, seizures, or injunctions, including orders to cease manufacturing.
The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Many Class I devices are exempt from FDA premarket review requirements. For Class II devices, the FDA generally requires clearance through the premarket notification, or 510(k) clearance process. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device's safety and effectiveness. Class III devices must typically be approved by the FDA before they are marketed.
Generally, establishments that manufacture or distribute devices, including manufacturers, repackagers and relabelers, specification developers, and initial importers, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and provide the FDA a list of the devices that they handle at their facilities.
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: all of the relevant elements of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, labeling regulations, restrictions on promotion and advertising, the Medical Device Reporting regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report certain recalls and field actions to the FDA).
The FDA has issued a regulation outlining specific requirements for "specimen transport and storage containers." "Specimen transport and storage containers" are medical devices "intended to contain biological specimens, body waste, or body exudate during storage and transport" so that the specimen can be used effectively for diagnostic examination. A specimen transport and storage container that is not labeled or otherwise represented as sterile, is a Class I exempt device. It is subject to MDR requirements, the reporting of corrections and removals, registration and listing. It is exempt from premarket review and from QSR requirements, except for recordkeeping and complaint handling requirements, so long as no sterility claims are made. Our facility is registered with the FDA as a specification developer, which means that we can sell the collection system under our own name and outline the specifications used to make the collection system, but a third party assembles the collection system for us. The containers we provide for collection and transport of Afirma GEC and Percepta samples from a physician to our clinical reference laboratory are listed as Class I devices with the FDA. We also plan to list our sample collection containers for Envisia samples with the FDA as Class I devices. If the FDA were to determine that our sample collection containers are not Class I devices, we would be required to file 510(k) applications and obtain FDA clearance to use the containers, which could be time consuming and expensive.
The FDA enforces the requirements described above by various means, including inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an Untitled Letter or Warning Letter to more severe sanctions such as:
fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;
recall or seizure of products;
operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; and
criminal prosecution.
Federal Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests and Research Use Only Products
Clinical laboratory tests like our proprietary genomic tests are regulated under CLIA, as administered by CMS, as well as by applicable state laws. Clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use, which are referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, currently are generally not subject to FDA regulation, although reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to regulation. We believe that the Afirma GEC and the Percepta and Envisia classifiers are LDTs. FDA currently exercises its enforcement discretion for LDTs. In October 2014, the FDA published draft guidance documents describing the framework by which they might regulate LDTs. The framework is similar to the guidance they issued previously. The comment period ended in February 2015. In November 2016, the FDA announced that they would not issue a final guidance on the oversight of LDTs. In January 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper on LDTs to synthesis of all the feedback received from various stakeholders; this did not represent a formal position of the FDA, nor is it enforceable. 
12

Some of the materials we use for our tests and that we may use for future tests are for research use only, or RUO. An RUO product is not intended for human clinical use and must be labeled "For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures." RUOs are a separate regulatory category and are not considered medical devices. They are therefore not subject to the FDA regulatory requirements discussed above. They cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness, or diagnostic utility or be intended for human clinical diagnostic or prognostic use. In November 2013, the FDA issued guidance regarding "Commercially Distributed In-Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only."
We cannot predict the ultimate form or impact of any such RUO, LDT or other guidance and the potential effect on our solutions or materials used to perform our diagnostic services. While we qualify all materials used in our diagnostic services according to CLIA regulations, we cannot be certain that the FDA might not promulgate rules or issue guidance documents that could affect our ability to purchase materials necessary for the performance of our diagnostic services. Should any of the reagents obtained by us from vendors and used in conducting our diagnostic services be affected by future regulatory actions, our business could be adversely affected by those actions, including increasing the cost of service or delaying, limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents necessary to perform the service.
We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including premarket review, will not be required in the future for our diagnostic services, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. Legislative proposals addressing oversight of LDTs were introduced in recent years, and we expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our tests or to develop and introduce new tests.
If premarket review, including approval, is required, our business could be negatively affected until such review is completed and clearance to market or approval is obtained, and the FDA could require that we stop selling our tests pending premarket clearance or approval. If our tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about the legal status of our services, if we are required by the FDA to label them investigational, or if labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are limited, order levels may decline and reimbursement may be adversely affected. The regulatory process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical studies and submitting a premarket notification or filing a PMA application with the FDA. If premarket review is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that our tests will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, nor can there any be assurance that labeling claims will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our solutions. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to heightened requirements of the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. We may also decide voluntarily to pursue FDA premarket review of our tests if we determine that doing so would be appropriate.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by health care providers, such as us. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties.
We have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these regulations. The requirements under these regulations may change periodically and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially more costly than under current requirements.
In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our business. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future from time to time. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements to which we are aware that we are subject. However, we can provide no assurance that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
13

Corporate Practice of Medicine
Numerous states, including California and Texas, have enacted laws prohibiting corporations such as us from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. This prohibition is generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. Violation of this prohibition may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us or the professional through licensing proceedings. The pathologists who review and classify thyroid FNA cytopathology results for Afirma are employed by Thyroid Cytopathology Partners, a Texas professional association, pursuant to services agreement between us and TCP. Pursuant to the agreement, we pay TCP a monthly fee on a per FNA basis, and TCP manages and supervises the pathologists who perform the cytopathology services as a component of the Afirma solution. TCP is managed by Pathology Resources Consultants, or PRC, which provides management and other services to medical practitioners. We have entered into a services agreement with PRC in connection with our arrangement with TCP, pursuant to which we engaged PRC exclusively to manage the pathology services being provided by TCP. Our agreement with PRC was effective until December 31, 2015 and thereafter automatically renews every year unless either party provides notice of intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the then-current term.
Federal and State Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions
We are subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar restrictions under California's Physician Ownership and Referral Act, or PORA. Together these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payer for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician's immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition.
Both the Stark Law and PORA contain an exception for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician. We have compensation arrangements with a number of physicians for personal services, such as speaking engagements and consulting activities. We have structured these arrangements with terms intended to comply with the requirements of the personal services exception to Stark and PORA.
However, we cannot be certain that regulators would find these arrangements to be in compliance with Stark, PORA or similar state laws. We would be required to refund any payments we receive pursuant to a referral prohibited by these laws to the patient, the payer or the Medicare program, as applicable.
Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:
•denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
•refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
•a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral;
•possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and
•a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law's prohibition.
These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required for a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act.
Further, a violation of PORA is a misdemeanor and could result in civil penalties and criminal fines. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by federal and California law. While we have attempted to comply with the Stark Law, PORA and similar laws of other states, it is possible that some of our financial arrangements with physicians could be subject to regulatory scrutiny at some point in the future, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review.
Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws
The Federal health care program Anti-kickback Law makes it a felony for a person or entity, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any federal health care program. A violation of the Anti-kickback Law may result in imprisonment for up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 in the case of individuals and $500,000 in the case of organizations. Convictions under the Anti-kickback Law result in mandatory exclusion from federal health care programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, HHS has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude health care providers and others engaged in prohibited 
14

activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Actions which violate the Anti-kickback Law also incur liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
Although the Anti-kickback Law applies only to federal health care programs, a number of states, including California, have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-kickback Law pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third- party payers. Both California's fee-splitting statute, Business and Professions Code Section 650, and its Medi-Cal anti-kickback statute, Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14107.2, have been interpreted by the California Attorney General and California courts in substantially the same way as HHS and the courts have interpreted the Anti-kickback Law. A violation of Section 650 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $50,000. A violation of Section 14107.2 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $10,000.
Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between health care providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. The law enforcement authorities, the courts and Congress have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between health care providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-kickback Law, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases.
In addition to statutory exceptions to the Anti-kickback Law, regulations provide for a number of safe harbors. If an arrangement meets the provisions of a safe harbor, it is deemed not to violate the Anti-kickback Law. An arrangement must fully comply with each element of an applicable safe harbor in order to qualify for protection. There are no regulatory safe harbors to California's Section 650.
Among the safe harbors that may be relevant to us is the discount safe harbor. The discount safe harbor potentially applies to discounts provided by providers and suppliers, including laboratories, to physicians or institutions. If the terms of the discount safe harbor are met, the discounts will not be considered prohibited remuneration under the Anti-kickback Law. California does not have a discount safe harbor. However, as noted above, Section 650 has generally been interpreted consistent with the Anti-kickback Law.
The personal services safe harbor to the Anti-kickback Law provides that remuneration paid to a referral source for personal services will not violate the Anti-kickback Law provided all of the elements of that safe harbor are met. One element is that if the agreement is intended to provide for the services of the physician on a periodic, sporadic or part-time basis, rather than on a full-time basis for the term of the agreement, the agreement specifies exactly the schedule of such intervals, their precise length, and the exact charge for such intervals. Our personal services arrangements with some physicians may not meet the specific requirement of this safe harbor that the agreement specify exactly the schedule of the intervals of time to be spent on the services because the nature of the services, such as speaking engagements, does not lend itself to exact scheduling and therefore meeting this element of the personal services safe harbor is impractical. Failure to meet the terms of the safe harbor does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances.
While we believe that we are in compliance with the Anti-kickback Law and Section 650, there can be no assurance that our relationships with physicians, academic institutions and other customers will not be subject to investigation or challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the Anti-kickback Law and Section 650 could have a negative effect on our business.
Other Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other health care fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the federal health care programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms "usual charge" and "substantially in excess" are ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations.
Further, the Federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly submitting a claim, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment or retaining an overpayment by the federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds 
15

in obtaining redress without the government's involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in fines, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs. California has an analogous state false claims act applicable to all payers, as do many other states; however, we may not be aware of all such rules and statutes and cannot provide assurance that we will be in compliance with all such laws and regulations.
International
Many countries in which we may offer any of our tests in the future have anti-kickback regulations prohibiting providers from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any national health care program. In situations involving physicians employed by state-funded institutions or national health care agencies, violation of the local anti-kickback law may also constitute a violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA.
The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual, business entity or employee of a U.S. business entity to offer or provide, directly or through a third party, including any potential distributors we may rely on in certain markets, anything of value to a foreign government official with corrupt intent to influence an award or continuation of business or to gain an unfair advantage, whether or not such conduct violate local laws. In addition, it is illegal for a company that reports to the SEC to have false or inaccurate books or records or to fail to maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We will also be required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors' activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
The standard of intent and knowledge in the Anti-Bribery cases is minimal-intent and knowledge are usually inferred from that fact that bribery took place. The accounting provisions do not require intent. Violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions for corporations and other business entities are subject to a fine of up to $2 million and officers, directors, stockholders, employees, and agents are subject to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Other countries, including the United Kingdom and other OECD Anti-Bribery Convention members, have similar anti-corruption regulations, such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act.
When marketing our tests outside of the United States, we may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing, prohibitions on the import of tissue necessary for us to perform our tests or restrictions on the export of tissue imposed by countries outside of the United States or the import of tissue into the United States, and marketing approval. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may in some cases require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required.
Patents and Proprietary Technology 
In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. To that end, we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contracts, such as confidentiality, invention assignment and licensing agreements. We also rely upon trade secret laws to protect unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation. In addition, we have what we consider to be reasonable security measures in place to maintain confidentiality. Our intellectual property strategy is intended to develop and maintain our competitive position.
We have thirteen issued patents that expire between 2029 and 2032 related to methods used in the Afirma diagnostic platform, in addition to fourteen pending U.S. utility patent applications and two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications. Some of these U.S. utility patent applications have pending foreign counterparts. We also exclusively licensed intellectual property, including rights to two issued patents that will expire between 2030 and 2032, and three pending U.S. utility patent applications in the thyroid space that would expire between 2030 and 2033 once issued, related to methods that are used in the Afirma diagnostic test, some of which have foreign counterparts. 
In the lung diagnostic space, we exclusively license intellectual property rights to seven pending patent applications and one issued patent in the United States and abroad. Patents issuing from the licensed portfolio will expire between 2024 and 2028. In addition, we own a PCT application and a pending U.S. application related to our Percepta test. The PCT application is currently in the process of being nationalized in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, and South Korea. We also own two applications related to other lung diseases, and a PCT application, a pending U.S. application, two ex-U.S. applications, and one provisional U.S. application related to Envisia. Any patents granted from our current lung cancer patent applications will expire no earlier than 2035 and those from the interstitial lung disease patent applications will expire no earlier than from 2034 to 2037.
16

We intend to file additional patent applications in the United States and abroad to strengthen our intellectual property rights; however, our patent applications (including the patent applications listed above) may not result in issued patents in a timely fashion or at all, and we cannot assure investors that any patents that have issued or might issue will protect our technology. We may receive notices of claims of potential infringement from third parties in the future.
We hold registered trademarks in the United States for "Veracyte," "Afirma," "Percepta," and the Afirma logo and have pending federal trademark applications for "Envisia” and the new "Veracyte" logo. We also hold registered trademarks in various jurisdictions outside of the United States.
We require all employees and technical consultants working for us to execute confidentiality agreements, which provide that all confidential information received by them during the course of the employment, consulting or business relationship be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with our research employees provide that all inventions, discoveries and other types of intellectual property, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, conceived by the individual while he or she is employed by us are assigned to us. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
Research and Development Expenses 
Research and development expenses were $15.3 million, $12.8 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Employees 
At December 31, 2016, we had 216 employees, of which 40 work in laboratory operations, 34 in research and development and clinical development, 61 in selling and marketing, and 81 in general and administrative, including 46 in billing and client services, 13 in information technology and 13 in finance. None of our employees are the subject of collective bargaining arrangements, and our management considers its relationships with employees to be good.
Environmental Matters
Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or new regulations will affect our business, operations or the cost of compliance.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We procure reagents, equipment, chips and other materials that we use to perform our tests from sole suppliers. We also purchase components used in our collection kits from sole-source suppliers. Some of these items are unique to these suppliers and vendors. In addition, we utilize a sole source to assemble and distribute our sample collection kits. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or the alternative sources will be available when we need them. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform the tests and for our collection kits, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications or are otherwise unusable, if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, or if we elect to change suppliers, an interruption in test processing could occur, we may not be able to deliver patient reports and we may incur higher one-time switching costs. Any such interruption may significantly affect our future revenue, cause us to incur higher costs, and harm our customer relationships and reputation. In addition, in order to mitigate these risks, we maintain inventories of these supplies at higher levels than would be the case if multiple sources of supply were available. If our test volume decreases or we switch suppliers, we may hold excess inventory with expiration dates that occur before use which would adversely affect our losses and cash flow position. As we introduce any new test, we may experience supply issues as we ramp test volume.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be party to lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. We are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings.
