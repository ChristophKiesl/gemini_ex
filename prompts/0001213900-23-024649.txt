 Item 1. Business.



Overview



Our Chief Executive Officer Oleg Nodelman has been the portfolio manager of EcoR1 Capital, LLC (“EcoR1”), a biotech-focused investment advisory firm that invests in companies at all stages of research and development, since he founded it in 2013. Our independent directors have extensive experience in drug discovery, preclinical research, clinical medicine, development and regulatory, operational and management leadership within the healthcare and financial industry, spanning a cumulative 100 years of experience in the biotech or pharma industry. We believe the experience of our team, strengthened by their industry network and our experienced board of directors, will enhance our management team’s ability to source viable prospective target businesses, capitalize them and ensure public-market readiness. Following the completion of our initial Business Combination, we believe our independent directors will fortify our ongoing operations by providing sound and experienced counsel on potential future acquisitions, divestitures, corporate strategy and human resources.



We are a blank check company incorporated in January 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). While we may pursue an initial Business Combination opportunity in any industry or geographical location, we intend to capitalize on our management team’s background and experience to identify innovative companies in the biotechnology sector that are domiciled in North America or Europe. Our Sponsor is EcoR1 Panacea Holdings II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of EcoR1 and Oleg Nodelman.



The registration statement for our Initial Public Offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) became effective on April 6, 2021. On April 9, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 17,250,000 Class A ordinary shares (the “Public Shares”), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 2,250,000 Public Shares, at $10.00 per Public Share, generating gross proceeds of $172,500,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 545,000 shares (the “Private Placement Shares”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Share in a private placement to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $5,450,000.



Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on April 9, 2021, an amount of $172,500,000 ($10.00 per Public Share) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Public Shares in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Shares was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), and will be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the our shareholders, as described below.

Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Shares, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The stock exchange listing rules require that the Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account). We will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.



We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Shares and the forward purchase shares, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the Initial Public Offering. We have not selected any specific Business Combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any Business Combination target. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



We will provide the holders of the Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations).



We will have until April 9, 2023 (or July 9, 2023, if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle, or definitive agreement for a Business Combination by April 9, 2023) to consummate a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”). However, if we have not completed a Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the Public Shareholders as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the our remaining Public Shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Effecting a Business Combination



Our Business Strategy



Our acquisition strategy is to identify and acquire an untapped opportunity within the biotechnology sector and build a public company. We believe our management team is well positioned to identify unique opportunities in our targeted sector based on their strong networks and experience and our core investment philosophy of identifying companies that are downside protected with outsized potential upside. Our selection process will leverage the relationships of our management team with industry captains, key opinion leaders, respected peers, and our management team’s network of investment banking executives, attorneys, and accountants. We also believe that EcoR1’s reputation, experience and track record of making investments in the biotechnology space will make us a preferred partner for these potential targets.
Business Combination Criteria



Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following criteria to evaluate prospective target businesses. We may however, decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria. We intend to seek to acquire one or more businesses that we believe have the following characteristics:

● | Risk/reward profile that is skewed to the upside. As is core to our basic investment approach, we intend to identify businesses that have an asymmetric risk/reward profile, significant competitive advantages and underexploited expansion opportunities that can benefit from access to additional capital and provide the potential for exceptional returns for our shareholders. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong management team in place. We intend to identify businesses with strong and experienced public-ready management teams, either in the form of entrepreneurs with whom we have worked in the past or seasoned industry veterans who have the experience and track record of value creation for their stockholders. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Innovative and quality science. While science is not the first place we begin our diligence, an important element in our process is to evaluate the rigor of the underlying science and understand a business’s unique value and ability to address an unmet need in the marketplace. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Multiple avenues for growth opportunities. We intend to identify businesses that have multiple shots on goal. Outside of the lead asset that may hold the underwritten downside protection, we are looking for businesses that have other areas for potential growth in their pipeline that are not necessarily reflected in the value assigned to them at acquisition, but provide multiple “ways to win.” 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential to provide significant benefits to patients. We intend to identify businesses that are developing therapies that have the potential to significantly enhance the treatment paradigm or represent first-in-class therapeutics for patients and physicians. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misunderstood by the market. We seek to find value where others do not typically look. We will seek target businesses that are attractively valued due to being overlooked, misunderstood, or undercapitalized. Our diligence process to identify these opportunities may include, among other things, a review and analysis of the business’s capital structure, potential for future earnings, preclinical or clinical data, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, existing or potential partnerships with larger pharma companies, and the industry and trends. We intend to leverage the operational experience and disciplined investment approach of our team to identify opportunities to unlock value that our experience in complex situations allows us to pursue. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management may deem relevant.

Additional Disclosures



Our Acquisition Process



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information that will be made available to us.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Management Team - Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.” In the event we seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors and if our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.



Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our securities following the Initial Public Offering, and accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Business Combination.



Our officers and directors are from time to time made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue, for a Business Combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a Business Combination transaction with us.



Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity to such entities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for one or more entities to which he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, he or she will honor these obligations and duties to present such Business Combination opportunity to such entities first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us. For more information, see the section entitled “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance - Conflicts of Interest.”



We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial Business Combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.



Initial Business Combination



The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) rules require that we must complete one or more Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial Business Combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial Business Combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.

We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our Public Shareholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target business, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial Business Combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.



Competition



We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire.



Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for Business Combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing Business Combinations. While we believe there will be numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Shares, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. Our Sponsor or any of its affiliates may make additional investments in us, although, other than the forward purchase agreement, our Sponsor and its affiliates has no obligation or other duty to do so. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our Public Shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our issued and outstanding alignment shares and the forward shares, and the dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing an initial Business Combination. If we have not completed our initial Business Combination within the required time period, our Public Shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account.



Human Capital



We currently have five officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our Company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the current stage of the Business Combination process.
