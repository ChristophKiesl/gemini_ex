ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
  GENERAL
  We were incorporated as Plandel Resources, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 19, 2010. On March 24, 2014, we changed our name to Sports Asylum, Inc. and on September 30, 2014, we changed our name to Cell MedX Corp. to reflect our new business direction.  On November 25, 2014, we completed the acquisition of a proprietary method for the application of bioelectric signaling to treat diabetes and related ailments (the eBalance Technology). With our acquisition of the eBalance Technology, we have shifted our business direction to the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic and non-therapeutic products that promote general wellness and alleviate complications associated with medical conditions including, but not limited to, diabetes, Parkinsons disease, and high blood pressure.  On November 26, 2014, we formed a subsidiary, Avyonce Cosmedics Inc., (the Avyonce) under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Avyonces main business activity was channelled towards the resale and marketing of spa technology and equipment to the worldwide beauty and wellness industry. On January 23, 2017, our board of directors approved the divestiture of Avyonce. To complete the divestiture, the Company agreed to transfer Avyonce to Ms. Jean Arnett for nominal consideration.   1   For accounting purposes, the divestiture was made effective as of December 31, 2016. Upon transferring Avyonce to Ms. Arnett, the Company and Avyonce agreed to forgive all intercompany debt outstanding at December 31, 2016, which translated into USD$63,503 (CAD$85,265). The decision to divest Avyonce was made in order to allow the Company to better concentrate on upcoming observational clinical studies of its eBalance Technology, while simultaneously continuing the development of therapeutic and non-therapeutic devices based on the eBalance Technology  On April 26, 2016, we formed a subsidiary, Cell MedX (Canada) Corp., (the Cell MedX Canada) under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, in anticipation of increased business activity in Canada. As of the day of this Annual Report on Form 10-K Cell MedX Canada is engaged in manufacturing and further development of the eBalance Technology.  BUSINESS OF CELL MEDX
  eBalance Technology Acquisition
  We acquired our proprietary technology for the use of microcurrents for the treatment of diabetes and related ailments, which we call eBalance Technology, on November 25, 2014, when we entered into a Technology Purchase Agreement with Jean Arnett and Bradley Hargreaves (the Purchase Agreement).  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves sold to us all of their respective rights, title and interests in and to the eBalance Technology. In consideration for the sale of the eBalance Technology, we paid to Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves a total of $100,000 and issued to each of Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves options for the purchase of up to 10,000,000 shares (20,000,000 shares in total) of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $0.05 per share (the Options) of which Options to acquire up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock vested on August 26, 2015.  On September 26, 2016, we entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement) with Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves to, among other things, cancel Options to acquire up to 17,500,000 shares of our Common stock, representing unvested portion of the Options granted to Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves as at September 26, 2016.  eBalance Technology
  eBalance Technology is based on the science of bioelectric signals, their affect on epigenetic events within human body, and ability to modify and affect the behavior of cells, tissue, and organs. Based on this technology Cell MedX is developing a radically different and very promising family of devices whose core technology demarcates it from the approaches currently in use and those in the future advances pipeline as reflected in current medical literature.  Microcurrent delivery devices used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and poor wound healing in diabetics have been in the marketplace for decades. However, the eBalance Technology can be distinguished from those devices, which have a limited utility and are not designed to treat diabetes at its core - the underlying metabolic disorder that leads to hyperglycemia and its sequelae. It is hoped that devices incorporating the eBalance Technology will effect changes much further upstream in the pathophysiology or natural history of diabetes. Not a me too device, nor an incremental improvement in an established realm, devices based on the eBalance Technology could, if proven through diligent research and development, open a new category of diabetes care.  The eBalance Technology is intended to expand the traditional healthcare model of diabetes management by enabling patients to manage their symptoms using a biosignal generating device that is simple to use, causes no discomfort, and can easily be incorporated into any lifestyle.  It is expected that the eBalance Technology, currently in the research and development stage, will form the basis for a product line that will be available to aid in the management of diabetes mellitus (both Type 1 and Type 2) and its complications, both as a professional clinic-based device and as a home use device.    2    A research and development plan adopted by the Company includes a series of investigations that allow to move the product from a prototype stage through a series of refinements and enhancements to achieve the safety and efficacy objectives of the device(s) upon which a set of claims intended for FDA, Health Canada and European Medical CE approval through the rigorous Pre-Market Approval (PMA) process is being constructed. Currently ongoing clinical observational trial (the Clinical Study) and future planned clinical trials (see Clinical Trials, below) will allow us to define the final marketing claims for our eBalance products, and will become the foundation for sales & marketing efforts in subsequent phases. The preliminary results of the Clinical Study and our in-house observations of the effects of the eBalance technology on human body, suggest that our claims will not only focus on overall diabetes management, reductions in average blood sugar (HbA1C) as well as other markers that denote the degree and quality of blood sugar control, we believe that claims may extend to pain management, blood pressure control, and alleviation of symptoms associated with Parkinsons disease.  Scientific Foundations
  Ion flows and transmembrane gradients produced by ion channels and pumps are key regulators of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Instructive roles for bioelectrical gradients in embryogenesis, regeneration, and neoplasm are being revealed.  The application of electromagnetic forces to human tissues to effect biologic change has been explored since the 19th century. A good deal of that was wishful thinking or deliberate deception. However, recent advances in molecular biology and imaging technology have allowed insight into the sources and downstream consequences of ion flows in complex organisms. In complement to the current focus on molecular genetics and stem cell biology, artificial modulation of bioelectrical signals in somatic tissues is a powerful modality that might result in profound advances in understanding and augmentation of regenerative capacity. Molecular bioelectricity and its role in cell-to-cell signaling and epigenetics (altering cell behavior without altering genes) provides a new pathway to discovery of technologies that can counteract the effects of many diseases.  Many cells in the human body are electrically excitable including those involved with production of chemical signals that affect blood sugar. One example of such a cell of the endocrine type is the L cell, which resides in the gut and secretes cell glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), peptide YY (PYY) and oxyntomodulin. GLP-1 is an enteric hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and improves glycaemia in Type 2 diabetes. There is evidence that in Type 2 diabetes these cells become unsynchronized. Growing these cells in tissue culture and subjecting them to specific electrical signals can act to resynchronize their chemical activity, and alter their behavior as a dispersed metabolic organ. This serves as an illustration of how endogenous ion flows may serve as key epigenetic regulators of cell behavior, and suggests that bioelectric mechanisms might be harnessed at a whole organism level to cause functional regenerative changes. It is possible that the eBalance Technology may affect these processes, although that has yet to be established. We intend to explore this hypothesis in greater detail during our clinical trials.  Market Opportunity - Diabetes and Its Complications
  Diabetes is a severe and debilitating disease with profound consequences, both for the individual and for society. The complications of diabetes are devastating, and the economic costs of care comprise a substantial portion of health care budgets. Despite the best efforts of the scientific community to devise a cure, the incidence of diabetes is on the rise. According to the information published by International Diabetes Association (IDA) in its Diabetes Atlas[1], in 2015 there were 415 million people living with diabetes worldwide and a further 318 million people were at high risk of developing diabetes. These numbers were expected to grow to 642 million and 481 million, respectively, by 2040. It is estimated that each year 86,000 new cases of juvenile diabetes are being diagnosed.    __________________ [1]
 International Diabetes Federation. (2015). IDF Diabetes Atlas - Seventh Edition, 12 and 52.   3    Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) with impaired metabolism of carbohydrate, fat and proteins resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Diabetes is one of the worlds oldest diseases with the syndrome being discovered centuries ago. The worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetes has highlighted the need for increased research efforts into treatment options for both the disease itself and its associated complications.  Type 1 diabetes is caused by destruction of the insulin secreting (beta) cells of the pancreas. The pathogenesis involves autoimmune processes that lead to an absolute insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors that result in insulin resistance and insulin deficiency. Non-genetic factors include increasing age, high caloric intake, obesity, central adiposity, sedentary lifestyle, and low birth weight. This group comprises approximately 90-95% of cases in the diabetes syndrome.  Chronic hyperglycemia leads to various metabolic, hormonal, and physiologic alterations in the body, which further develop a number of secondary complications, resulting in the major increases in morbidity and mortality seen with all types of diabetes. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of cardiovascular problems, such as coronary artery disease, chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure.  High blood sugar over time can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish nerves, especially in the legs, causing tingling, numbness, burning or pain. Gradually, all sensation can be lost. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. In diabetics, minor wounds easily become serious infections, which may heal poorly. Severe damage might require toe, foot or leg amputation.  Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness. It also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Diabetic hypertension is a major contributor to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which often requires dialysis or a kidney transplant.  Damage to the nerves that control digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue. Diabetes may leave people more susceptible to a variety of skin disorders, including bacterial and fungal infections. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  Diabetes Care and Management
  In the absence of a cure, the goal of diabetes management is to reduce the likelihood of complications by eliminating the wide fluctuations in blood sugar that define the disease. The current toolset for managing blood sugar levels is limited.  Diabetes management entails the administration of insulin in combination with careful blood glucose monitoring (Type 1 diabetes) or involves adjustments to diet and exercise levels, use of oral anti-diabetic drugs and insulin administration to control blood sugar (Type 2 diabetes).  Blood sugars may be self-monitored using a portable, personal device that takes a small blood sample obtained with a tiny finger lancet. Using such a device, tight glycemic control becomes possible, as an adjunct to insulin therapy, either injected or delivered via a wearable insulin pump. This technology-enabled self-care model has been shown to reduce complications and improve the quality of life in Type 1 diabetes. Replicating these results in Type 2 diabetes has been challenging, largely reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the disease and the fact that it changes with increasing age and other factors. Implantable sensors that measure blood glucose continually have come into practice more recently.  The value of self-monitoring enablement using electronic devices, including the next generation of wearable health appliances, is aided by incorporating decision support algorithms and other intelligent information technology tools. The concept of the artificial pancreas combines glucose sensing technologies with automated insulin delivery by pump, with software based decision making interposed so that the former drives the latter (fully automated feedback loop). Such systems are under development but have not yet made their way to market.   4    Expansion of Disease Focus
  Cell MedX understands that even though the current eBalance Technology has significant potential of success based solely on treating complications caused by diabetes with its underlying wellness treatment technology, in order to capture a larger market share, more specialized software / treatment options will be essential to the Companys future growth and success. The Company anticipates that it will commence development of specialized software to target other ailments such as gout, hypertension, heart disease, neurological disorders, and depression among others. As at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has not determined the timeframe for rolling out such expansion, however, based on the in-house observations of the effects of the eBalance Therapy on human body, as well as positive response from the Clinical Study subjects, we feel that additional stress on research and fine-tuning of our eBalance devices to treat pain would become near-term priority.  Pain is perhaps the number one reason people seek professional medical help and take medications; it is what tells the brain that something is wrong and is caused in part by insufficient electrical charge in cells. Since eBalance therapy restores electrical charges to cells it allows for the rapid reduction or elimination of pain from many sources.  Empirical Modeling
  The first-in-human observations took place over many years and were carefully documented. The results of these observations lead to the belief that a specific device with a specific set of bioelectric signals of known waveform, frequency, amplitude, pulse, and duration, accompanied by sensing circuits that respond to fluctuations in the bodys response, in a closed feedback loop, produced cumulative effects that led to remarkable global effects in functional aspects of living in a person who had lived with Type 1 diabetes since age 10. Casual trials in another person with longstanding diabetes, Type 2 in this case, yielded findings of a similar nature in a limited time frame. These observations were followed by broader observational studies by Cell MedXs team.  Effects observed in these observational studies include subjective reports of diminished fatigue, improved cognition, diminished neuropathic limb pain, improved sleep, reduction in swelling of extremities, improved skin appearance in color and texture, and a reduction in visual disturbance. Objective measures included healing of wounds, control of blood pressure leading to discontinuation or reduction of medication, and greatly improved control of blood sugars with remarkable diminution in HbA1C (which reflects average blood sugar over months). Remarkably, in the context of Type 1 Diabetes with other potential variables remaining the same, insulin requirements diminished to a considerable degree.  Clinical Trials
  During January through March 2015, we carried out a preliminary Pilot Trial (the Pilot Trial), which was designed to examine the short term metabolic impact of a single treatment with eBalance Technology on two diabetic subjects. Pre- and post-treatment blood samples from each subject were sent for extensive metabolic pathway analysis at the University of Alberta Metabolomics Unit. From those studies we observed alterations in several pathways, which are known to be deficient in persons with diabetes. The results of the Pilot Trial were notable in that significant shifts in metabolites related to blood sugar handling and disposal occurred in a very short time frame, with the only intervening variable being a 10-minute treatment with eBalance Technology.  The findings from the Pilot Trial were then used to inform further experimentation, including selection of metabolic end points for testing during a Phase IB clinical trial, which we started preparations for in July 2015. Due to shortage in available funding, we decided to temporarily postpone the Phase IB clinical Trial.  During the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016 we engaged Nutrasource Diagnostics Inc. (Nutrasource) to commence observational clinical trial in Canada (Clinical Study) to assess and quantify eBalance technologys ability to alter key metabolic pathways while targeting improved blood sugar control.  During our Fiscal 2017, the Company, with the assistance of Nutrasource, secured the main research facility in Hamilton, Ontario, completed an investigational protocol as well as Informed Consent and Ethics Board submission documentation, in an anticipation to start in-patient phase of the Clinical Study.   5   Based on finalized investigational protocol the Clinical Study was structured to assess the impact of three months of the eBalance therapy, as an adjunct treatment, on HbA1c in thirty (30) Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics. The secondary endpoints of the Clinical Study were defined to observe changes from baseline and medical history of each Clinical Study subject in the following;  · Insulin sensitivity · Diabetic neuropathy · Diabetic foot pain and numbness · Wound healing · Blood pressure · Kidney function · Any other changes reported by patients  The Company received Health Canadas approval to commence the Clinical Study on January 12, 2017. The approval from the Ethics Review Board was received on January 30, 2017. With all required approvals in place, Dr. Richard Tytus, the Lead Investigator on the Study, and his team at Hamilton Medical Research Group commenced screening for qualified subjects in late February of 2017.  In-patient phase of the Clinical Study was completed on July 24, 2017, ahead of schedule and without any patient drop outs or patients lost to follow up. During the Clinical Study each subject received a 13.55-minute treatment with eBalance Pro twice per week for a total of 25 treatments. Following the therapy many subjects indicated various positive changes to their wellbeing including, but not limited to, noticeable reduction in neuropathies associated with diabetes, alleviated muscle pain, increased wound healing, reduced fluid retention, with no one experiencing any negative side effects of the eBalance Therapy.  The site close out is expected the week of August 28th. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Nutrasource has reviewed all case report forms for all subjects and finalized outstanding data clarification reports, allowing Nutrasource to begin compilation of the database in preparation for a white paper on the results of the Clinical Study.  Product Development
  On October 1, 2015, we entered into a development agreement with Mr. Claudio Tassi (the Development Agreement) for the development of the first eBalance Professional Series Device (the Prototype). Based on the Development Agreement we agreed to pay Bioformed Aestetic SL (Bio4Med), a company Mr. Tassi is a director of, $12,848 (EURO 12,000) and, upon successful completion of the development of the first eBalance Prototype, issue to Mr. Tassi, 100,000 shares of our common stock. We received the first Prototype in November 2015.  On December 4, 2015, we executed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) with Mr. Tassi and Bio4Med. The LOI contemplated that (i) we will enter into a technology development and license agreements with Mr. Tassi and Bio4Med to continue development of therapeutic devices based on the eBalance Technology; (ii) upon approval of the first Prototype, we will place an order for the production of 25 devises; and (iii) Mr. Tassi will provide his services for an initial term of four months commencing on December 4, 2015.  On December 15, 2015, as contemplated under the LOI, we ordered the first batch which consisted of 25 eBalance Pro devices with the same configuration as the original Prototype, which were manufactured in early 2016. These devices were designed as a stand-alone unit, controlled by proprietary software installed in an external computer specifically designed to be used with the eBalance device. Once internally tested, the devices were distributed to selected clinics and practitioners as well as used directly by the Company in our in-house observations to see the effects of the eBalance Therapy on human body.  After several months of testing, we received a feedback from the clinicians and participants, which allowed for further refinement of the devices, which were limited to aesthetics and ease of use. The Company ordered from Bio4Med 20 units of the second generation eBalance device, which were received in December 2016. These devices were also distributed to practitioners for observations and further testing.   6   In early 2017 the management decided to discontinue negotiations with Bio4Med on technology development and license agreements, as contemplated under the LOI, and chose to move manufacturing of the eBalance devices to North America. The decision to move to Canada was the outcome of further research we had done on potential markets, tax implications of manufacturing the devices in Europe versus in Canada, cross border transfer pricing, availability of raw material and the control of the production processes. As such, in the fourth quarter of its Fiscal 2017, we entered into a production agreement with an ISO 9001 certified manufacturing facility in Coquitlam, BC, and selected North American suppliers for sourcing essential components.  As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are in the process of producing our first batch of 50 eBalance devices manufactured in Canada, which is expected to be completed in early September.  In order to continue our manufacturing in Canada and move forward with further development and improvements of our devices based on the eBalance Technology, we will require additional capital. We are planning to raise this capital through debt or equity financing or through a combination of both.  Medical Device Regulations and Government Approvals
  The manufacture, packaging, marketing and importing of medical devices is heavily regulated in the United States, Canada and Europe. Further, we expect that any other countries in which we may seek to sell or market devices based on the eBalance Technology will similarly have an extensive regulatory environment.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for regulating firms that manufacture, repackage, re-label and/or import medical devices sold in the United States. Health Canadas Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate is responsible for regulating the manufacture, labeling, packaging, distribution and import of medical devices sold in Canada.  Prior to selling any devices based on the eBalance Technology for the treatment in the United States or Canada, we will be required to make applications to obtain approval from the FDA and Health Canada, respectively. The type of application and complexity of the procedures for obtaining FDA and Health Canada approval will depend upon the classification of the devices that we develop under the provisions of the United States Food and Drugs Act of 1906, as amended, and the Food and Drugs Act (Canada), as amended, respectively, and related regulations.  To assist us with the certifications we have partnered with several providers specializing in the certification process for medical devices, who are assisting us with our pre-market 510K application with FDA and Class 2 certification with Health Canada. It is expected that both certifications will be secured in the third quarter of our Fiscal 2018. Due to the globalization of medical device certification standards, the current certification work will also allow the Company to start selling its devices to Brazil, Australia, Japan and Europe.  Third Party Payers / Private Insurers
  Reimbursement for medical devices through Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., and through health protectorates in other nations, is not guaranteed. Third party private payers or private insurers typically follow the lead of government healthcare providers. A decision as to whether a device or treatment is covered involves extensive negotiations and is typically predicated on the concept of health cost savings. If the device can be shown to reduce health care costs through prevention of expensive complications of diabetes, such applications for approvals would be more favorably reviewed.  Marketing Plans
  Once approved for marketing, we intend to market eBalance devices incorporating the eBalance Technology through authorized dealers and distributors of medical equipment to professional / institutional users. With the limited number of eBalance devices currently being built, the Companys marketing team has established that leasing the devices to various clinics on per-treatment basis would provide the best return on investment, and will allow for the opportunity to collect recurring revenue.    7   As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K the Company specified several geographical zones, which will be assigned to certain distributors who are now being selected. Specifically, the Company is in negotiations with Cascadia Health 2020 Corporation, who has been selected as a representative and distributor for all of Canada. In order to secure the right for exclusive distributorship, the Cascadia Health will be required to place an order for a minimum of 50 devices at the time of entering into a definitive LOI. Cascadia Health paid the Company $5,653 (CAD$7,500) deposit for the right to finalize the letter of intent.  Competition
  The current market for treatments that assist in the control and management of diabetes and its complications is highly competitive. However, since our technology is based on the microcurrent therapy, which is not traditionally used for management of diabetes, direct competition for eBalance Technology is not well defined.  Indirect competitors include a multitude of pharmaceutical companies that produce insulin and other various drugs to maintain and prevent diabetes related complications; companies producing glucose monitoring devices.  Competitors in microcurrent therapy would include BodiHealth Systems, focusing on pain relief market in US; Electromedical Products International, Inc., the company that developed Alpha-Stim® PPM, which treats and alleviates acute, chronic or postoperative pain using microcurrent therapy.  Patents/Trade Marks/Licenses/Franchises/Concessions/Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
  Our eBalance Technology is not protected by a patent or a trademark.  As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are in the process of determining the best possible options for securing the proprietary technology represented by the eBalance Technology.  Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees
  We currently have no employees other than our executive officers, who provide their services as independent consultants. We contract for the services of medical and technical staff we require to administer our observational studies and the clinical trials, as well as other consultants on as needed basis.
