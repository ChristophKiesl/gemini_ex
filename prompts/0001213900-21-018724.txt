Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in September 2019 and formed as a special purpose acquisition company known as Healthcare Merger Corp. (“HCMC”) for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Our legacy business (“Legacy SOC Telemed”) was founded in 2004. On October 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Legacy SOC Telemed pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 29, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among us, Sabre Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of HCMC, Sabre Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of HCMC, and Specialists On Call, Inc, a Delaware corporation. We collectively refer to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as the “Merger” or the “Merger Transaction.” As part of the Merger Transaction, we changed our name from Healthcare Merger Corp. to SOC Telemed, Inc.
Our Mission
 
Our mission is to connect patients to the highest quality clinicians at the right time, regardless of proximity.
 
Overview
 
We are a leading provider of acute care telemedicine services and technology to U.S. hospitals and healthcare systems based on number of clients. We provide technology enabled clinical solutions which include acute teleNeurology, telePsychiatry, and teleICU, and we believe that we have significant opportunities to expand into other specialties, such as our telePulmonology service introduced in 2021. We support specialty care, providing time-sensitive specialty care when patients are vulnerable and may not otherwise have access. Our solution was developed to support complex workflows in the acute care setting by integrating our cloud-based software platform, Telemed IQ, with a panel of patient advocates and a network of clinical specialists to create a seamless, acute telemedicine solution. We have delivered over one million telemedicine consultations since the founding of our business in 2004.
 
Hospitals and health systems today face many challenges. Over the next decade, the U.S. is expected to continue to face a shortage of primary and specialist physicians in both urban and rural communities, which will adversely impact access to care and clinical outcomes. In addition, hospitals and health systems have difficulty efficiently staffing with unknown and unpredictable patient demand, leading to increased costs or delays in patient care. These challenges, combined with increased financial pressure, are driving hospitals and healthcare systems to seek solutions that can deliver cost-effective access to qualified clinicians and high-quality care.
 
We focus on the acute telemedicine industry. Access to timely care is essential to improved health outcomes, but the complexity in the operating environment for acute telemedicine creates significant barriers to entry. Technology enablers and network reliability are critical to connect remote specialists to patients and bedside providers within minutes. Additionally, predictive analytics, actionable data, a flexible decision engine and workflow assurance facilitate rapid clinician deployment and intelligent support in prioritizing critical patient needs. An effective telemedicine platform also must be integrated across hospitals and health systems yet work within the local system hardware and software infrastructure in order to optimize workflow and enhance clinical outcomes.
 
Our cloud-based Telemed IQ technology platform and deployment engine optimizes workflows and supports both scheduled and on-demand telemedicine evaluations via any web-enabled device, at any care location, across the care continuum. Our platform is a fully integrated and configurable technology solution that seamlessly combines voice, video, imaging, electronic medical record (EMR) integration, clinical workflow optimization, clinical resource management, analytics, predictive modeling and other reporting tools. As an enterprise offering, Telemed IQ allows hospitals, health systems and other healthcare organizations the ability to provide telemedicine programs either with their own clinical team or in conjunction with our affiliated network of established, board-certified physicians and other provider specialists. Our affiliated national provider network is comprised of more than 170 board-certified neurologists, psychiatrists and intensivists, representing a critical mass of scarce clinical resources ready for deployment and collaboration at health facilities nationwide. Telemedicine has been growing rapidly over the last several years and this growth has accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to unprecedented change in the way healthcare is delivered both in the United States and around the world.

We have experienced significant growth since the founding of our business in 2004. We derive our revenues primarily from hospitals and health systems, physician groups and government clients. Our clients generally enter into multi-year agreements where they pay us a fixed monthly fee for the availability to perform a pre-determined number of consults. If our clients exceed that fixed monthly allotment, we charge a per consult rate for any subsequent consultations during that period. In 2020, approximately 64% of our revenues were from fixed monthly fees. Clients may also choose to license the Telemed IQ platform as a stand-alone software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution for virtualizing their own clinician networks. In these instances, we receive a subscription license fee for each clinician that uses our platform. Although revenues from Telemed IQ subscription license fees have been immaterial to date, they have been increasing in recent periods and we plan to continue to invest in developing these revenue streams to address our market opportunity. Recently, our affiliated provider network began enrolling with and seeking payment from certain payers where professional services delivered are eligible for reimbursement under payer programs.
 
COVID-19 Impact on Telemedicine
 
In January 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) declared the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) a public health emergency and has renewed this determination several times, most recently in January 2021. In March 2020, the World Health Organization also declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets. In response, many countries, including the United States, have implemented business closures and restrictions, stay-at-home and social distancing ordinances and similar measures to combat and contain the spread of the pandemic. While some of these restrictions have been lifted or eased in many jurisdictions as the rates of COVID-19 infections have decreased or stabilized, a resurgence of COVID-19 and the discovery of various new COVID-19 variants in some markets has slowed, halted or reversed the reopening process altogether. Although the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is currently underway in the United States, we expect that it will take significant time before the vaccines are widely available on a significant scale.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the telemedicine market by increasing utilization, awareness and acceptance among patients and providers. In the current environment, telemedicine has been promoted at the highest levels of government as a key tool for on-going healthcare delivery while infection control and government orders require individuals to shelter in-place or remain socially distant. Telemedicine provides access to care when access to healthcare facilities are limited due to state-mandated stay-at-home orders and general patient fear of traditional in-person visits. Moreover, as the clinicians themselves were quarantined or otherwise relegated to their homes due to safety issues, telemedicine provided a solution for remote providers to continue care for patients and for hospitals to access additional specialists to augment remaining staff. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the U.S. Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) significantly reduced regulatory and reimbursement barriers for telemedicine. As a result, we believe telemedicine spending increased starting in the second quarter of 2020, and we expect this trend to continue after the public health emergency. In addition to Medicare and Medicaid, many states have issued executive orders or even permanent legislation removing or reducing the regulatory and reimbursement barriers for telemedicine.
 
Our Stakeholders
 
We deliver value to all our stakeholders — the hospital, physician and patient.
 

● | Hospitals: We provide hospitals with efficient, collaborative high-quality care at a lower cost. We enable hospitals to retain high-value capabilities benefiting their communities, such as stroke care, to avoid costly backlogs for psychiatric evaluations in emergency departments, and to improve patient quality of care, through timely access to specialized resources.

Our Telemed IQ SaaS Platform
 
Adapting the acute care workflow to telemedicine involves a complex orchestration between patient, remote physician, bedside health provider and the consult coordination experts. All of these participants are mediated by a low-code, highly configurable software platform, which features a configurable decision engine, matching patients and physicians and coordinating the various stages of the procedure and follow-up.
 

Illustrative example:
 

● | Patient presents in the emergency room with stroke symptoms. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Onsite clinician initiates a consult request to a teleNeurologist using our Telemed IQ platform. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our configurable decision engine prioritizes the consult given clinically based acuity and required response time data points. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Simultaneously, the platform scores and ranks the physicians who are eligible to handle this consult. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | After the most appropriate and available teleNeurologist is selected, contacted and engaged on our Telemed IQ platform, the physician evaluates the patient over an automated video connection. Through our platform, the physician views the same images that are available in the hospital and collaborates with the onsite clinicians for the patient’s care. Upon completion of the consultation, evaluation notes are seamlessly transferred via the Telemed IQ into the patient record of the hospital’s electronic medical record.

Our Solution
 

Acute care is a complex and heterogeneous environment within a single hospital and every hospital within a larger integrated delivery network can have its own unique workflows. To operate in this environment, we need to be flexible, adapting to these workflows and the technology infrastructure. We built our platform technology and solutions around this premise and have successfully addressed this complexity. As a result, we can enable varying provider-to-patient and provider-to-provider interactions across different specialties, provider groups, locations and technology infrastructure. Our solution supports both scheduled and on-demand telemedicine evaluations, can be deployed across our network of board-certified physicians and other provider specialists, third-party clinicians or both, and can run on any telemedicine endpoint at any location. All of these capabilities have been built into our cloud-based Telemed IQ technology platform. We leverage this platform across three different configurations that we sell to the market.

● | Core Services: We integrate the Telemed IQ SaaS platform with our own consult coordination center and provider network of neurologists, psychiatrists and intensivists to provide a complete, turnkey acute telemedicine solution. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Managed Services: We provide the combination of our Telemed IQ SaaS platform with our consult coordination center and the client integrates these services with its own or other third-party clinicians. Our platform currently enables more than 20 specialties. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Telemed IQ SaaS Platform: We provide our platform by itself to health systems and other provider groups that want to incorporate their own consult coordination center and clinician networks.

The benefits of our core services are to rapidly provide access to scarce physicians and other provider specialists to help our hospital partners increase access to specialist care, improve outcomes for their patients, retain high-value capabilities, reduce costs and enable clients to care for more clinically complex cases.
 
Managed Services: We provide the combination of our Telemed IQ SaaS platform with our consult coordination center and the client integrates these services with its own or other third-party physicians. This flexible approach enables our clients to optimize the provisioning of their valuable clinical resources across a broad geography utilizing a proven and scaled telemedicine platform that is configurable for their needs on a multi-specialty basis. We currently enable more than 20 specialties on our platform, which can support additional specialties as needed by our clients.
 
Telemed IQ SaaS Platform: We provide our Telemed IQ platform on a standalone basis as a SaaS solution to health systems and other provider groups that want to incorporate their own consult coordination center and physician resources. This subscription-based model allows clients to fully leverage their investments in transfer, call and coordination centers to manage and facilitate telemedicine interactions across their enterprise, using a technology platform that was purpose-built to support the complex and unique needs of an acute patient care setting.
 
Technology
 
Our Telemed IQ SaaS platform was purpose-built to run our acute care services business. We developed a scaled, configurable platform with sophisticated functionality to meet our clinical, financial and operational needs. Our clients benefit from our experience, data analysis, continuous enhancements and best practices. Our Telemed IQ platform helps our clients achieve their clinical, financial and operational goals by facilitating the efficient deployment of clinical resources to where it is needed most. Our platform can be extended to other specialties and service lines, based on the client’s needs, and has been utilized across more than fifteen specialties with a high degree of customization. Clients can deploy the platform with their own network of clinicians, our network of board-certified physicians and other provider specialists, third-party clinicians, or any combination thereof.
 
Our low-code development platform provides us with a significant competitive advantage. We can conceptualize, configure, and deploy new workflows and clinical service lines rapidly, adding value to our clients and facilitating growth. Our browser-based platform lets clinicians conduct telemedicine evaluations using a laptop, tablet or phone application on iOS and Android platforms. We offer two-way integration with electronic medical record systems and have received formal certification from both Epic and Cerner.
 
To optimize the assignment of clinicians to the telemedicine consult, our platform uses multiple automated decision support engines that sort incoming consults according to client-guided custom priority rules. The decision support engines determine the most appropriate clinician who can and should take the consult based on each client’s predetermined rules. Our platform also manages the structured communication between the clinician initiating the consult and the clinician accepting the consult assigned action.
 
Our Telemed IQ platform captures a significant volume of clinical, financial and operational data that is utilized on a de-identified basis to provide our clients with actionable data analytics and insights. We also enable our clients to run analyses and benchmark their performance against similar or geographically proximate organizations. We believe our data analytic tools and transparency fosters trust among our clients and helps optimize their workflow while improving quality of care, throughput, response time, and productivity.
 
Scalability and Security
 
We host our applications and serve our clients from several cloud-based data centers, including those operated by AWS, which are designed to support high levels of availability and have redundant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones. Our data center facilities employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity, including redundant power and cooling systems and advanced fire and flood prevention. We have implemented telehealth industry-standard processes, policies and tools across our software development and network administration, including regularly scheduled vulnerability scanning and third-party penetration testing in order to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in our system. We also have achieved HITRUST CSF security certification, a recommended framework trusted by many health systems and hospitals to manage risk.

We have achieved over 99.99% uptime over the 12 months ended December 31, 2020. We monitor our systems for any signs of trouble and take precautions as necessary. Systems transmit encrypted backup files and logs over secure connections to multiple storage devices.
 
Operations
 
Our implementation, training, clinical provisioning, credentialing, client service and technical teams work collaboratively to onboard new clients and efficiently execute acute care telemedicine consultation requests.
 
Implementation and Training
 
We can deploy our solution rapidly, in less than 72 hours, as we demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the ordinary course, a typical installation requires approximately 90 to 120 days, depending on client availability. We provide training for our clients to ensure a seamless transition to our telemedicine services. Prior to any implementation, we analyze our clients’ workflow and develop an implementation plan that meets their objectives and incorporates industry best practices.
Clinical Provisioning
 
Our clinical provisioning team matches clinical supply to demand by focusing on both our client’s long-term and short-term staffing needs. We analyze historical data and use our proprietary and predictive analytics and tools to evaluate each clinical service line to project consult demand in order to assess the number of specialists needed for each hour of the day and for each day of the week. We continuously monitor and analyze utilization data from across the country to identify patterns, surges and spikes and adjust coverage as necessary. We also use a variety of data sources and analytics to strategically drive our long-term staffing strategy and scale our practice in advance of demand.
Credentialing, Licensing, and Privileging
 
Acute telemedicine is different from consumer telehealth offerings because physicians must be both licensed in the state where the patient is located and be privileged at the healthcare facility where the patient is being treated. These requirements create a highly complex compliance environment, because there is significant variability in the licensing and credentialing requirements and procedures mandated by individual state licensing boards and related lead times. At the facility level, the administrative burden associated with credentialing and privileging is a resource-intensive process. We ensure that our network of board-certified physicians and other provider specialists acquire and maintain the qualifications required for their specialty and receive the licenses and privileges necessary to practice across multiple states and facilities in a timely manner. We have established rigorous processes and policies that allow us to meet the expectations of our clients and comply with applicable federal, state and accreditation standards. Every physician who applies for privileges is reviewed by a group of peers in accordance with applicable regulatory and accreditation requirements. We currently manage over 2,600 licenses and 13,700 privileges on behalf of our network physicians.
Consult Coordination Center
 
The critical nature of our work often requires physicians to make life-saving decisions shortly after interacting with a health facility or patient. Every inbound request and consultation is monitored by a team of consult coordination experts. These experts are responsible for monitoring and managing the efficient execution of our services from the initial consult request through preparation, physician assignment, and post evaluation documentation on a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week, 365-days-a-year basis. Our technology solution empowers the team managing this capability with tools to manage consult flow, prioritize by consult severity and ensure that the technology, physician, bedside provider and patient are ready for clinical interaction. All of our communications take place in real-time providing physicians and other provider specialists with immediate updates around patient status. Appropriate metrics are captured regarding telemedicine consults for quality assurance purposes and evaluation in quality care and client satisfaction.

Quality
 
We are focused on providing the highest level of clinical and operational quality. We have developed a comprehensive quality management program that supports evidence-based practices, tracks client satisfaction levels and encourages continuous improvement of telemedicine services. Our clinical leaders regularly review industry accepted standards and when appropriate, make changes to our processes, documentation standards and templates. As new practice standards are introduced, our network of board-certified physicians and other provider specialists review these standards and adapt them for national telemedicine practice. Our network physicians and other specialists are continuously trained and evaluated to appropriately integrate and utilize these updated practice standards.
 
In 2006, we were the first telemedicine organization to earn The Joint Commission’s Gold Seal of Approval for Ambulatory Health Care Accreditation, a status we have retained since that time. Similar to our hospital clients, we are evaluated for compliance with ambulatory care standards, including coordination of care, physician credentialing, monitoring of clinical quality, operational infrastructure, security and emergency procedures. Since 2019, we have been accredited for telemedicine by URAC (formerly known as the ClearHealth Quality Institute). Our processes undergo regular review by The Joint Commission and URAC as part of their ongoing accreditation processes.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We have a team of experienced sales executives who are primarily responsible for selling our core solutions and services directly to hospitals and health systems. Our team is organized into geographic territories and supported by clinical experts, technical experts, business development and lead-generation managers. In addition, we have developed channel clients who incorporate our platform as part of a model that combines on-site staffing solutions with telemedicine.
 
Our marketing program supports our growth and lead generation though content development, brand awareness, search engine optimization, field marketing events, integrated campaigns, industry relations and public media.
 
Research and Development
 
Our ability to continue to differentiate and enhance our platform depends on our capacity to continue to introduce new services, technologies and functionality. Our product development team, which as of December 31, 2020, consisted of 30 employees, is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our solution. We are a client-led organization that has invested heavily in our strategic product management team, low-code development platform, network of industry relationships and innovative infrastructure. We focus our research and development spend on delivering new products and further enhancing the functionality, performance and flexibility of our solution.
Competition
 
The telemedicine market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors and new entrants introduce new telemedicine services and software platforms or other technology to U.S. healthcare providers, particularly hospitals and healthcare systems. We currently face competition from a range of companies, including other incumbent providers of acute care telemedicine consultation services and specialized software providers that are continuing to grow and enhance their service offerings and develop more sophisticated and effective transaction and service platforms. In addition, large, well-financed healthcare providers have in some cases developed their own telemedicine services and technologies utilizing their own and third-party platforms and may provide these solutions to their patients.
 
While there are many competitors in our industry, many began from a hardware-centric focus, with the goal of extending and integrating their devices into hospitals. We approached the development of our Telemed IQ SaaS platform differently by focusing on optimizing a large network of board-certified physicians and other provider specialists across numerous complex workflows. As a result, configurability, modularity and optimization became imperative and we subsequently made these capabilities available on a low-code development platform to address the configurability needs of our clients.
 
We believe we compete favorably based on the following key competitive factors for our industry:
 

● | access to a broad network of established, board-certified physicians and other provider specialists;

Tele-Physicians Practices
 
We support and coordinate the services of our affiliated clinician network through administrative support services agreements or similar arrangements (“Administrative Agreements”) with six independent professional entities: Tele-Physicians, P.C. (d/b/a California Tele-Physicians), Tele-Physicians, P.C. (d/b/a Georgia Tele-Physicians), Tele-Physicians, P.C. (d/b/a New Jersey Tele-Physicians), Tele-Physicians, P.A. (d/b/a Texas Tele-Physicians), JSA Health California PC and JSA Health Texas PLLC (collectively, the “Tele-Physicians Practices”). The Tele-Physician Practices are 100% physician-owned and employ or contract with physicians for the clinical and professional services provided to clients of ours and the Tele-Physicians Practices. Under the Administrative Agreements, we have agreed to serve as the sole and exclusive administrator of all non-clinical, day-to-day operations and business functions required for the administrative operation of each Tele-Physicians Practice, including business support services, contracting support, accounting, billing and payables support and technology support, so that each Tele-Physicians Practice may provide to its clients professional medical diagnosis, evaluation and therapeutic intervention services in certain specialty areas through telemedicine consultations. The Administrative Agreements require the Tele-Physicians Practices to maintain the state licensure and other credentialing requirements of its physicians and professional liability insurance covering each of its physicians. We separately carry a medical professional liability insurance policy. Under each of the Administrative Agreements, the applicable Tele-Physicians Practice pays us a monthly administrative fee of a fixed dollar amount multiplied by the average number of client facilities then under contract with the Tele-Physicians Practice, plus certain direct costs incurred by us on behalf of the Tele-Physicians Practice. Typically, the Administrative Agreements have an initial five-year term and automatic annual extensions thereafter. Unless earlier terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties or unilaterally by a party following the commencement of bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings by the non-terminating party, a material breach of the applicable Administrative Agreement by the non-terminating party or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, each of the Administrative Agreements automatically renews for a one-year term, unless either party to the applicable services agreement delivers written notice of its intent not to renew at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the preceding term. The Tele-Physicians Practices are considered variable interest entities and their financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We primarily rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements and employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements and other similar measures to establish and protect our intellectual property and internally developed technology, including our Telemed IQ software platform. Our trademarks include SOC Telemed, marks for our acquired businesses, and various marketing slogans. Although we do not currently hold a patent for Telemed IQ, we continually assess the most appropriate methods of protecting our intellectual property and may decide to pursue available protections in the future. However, these intellectual property rights and procedures may not prevent others from competing with us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our solution or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, and may also attempt to develop similar technology independently. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could harm our business.

Regulatory Environment
 
Our operations are subject to comprehensive United States federal, state and local regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to expand and become more restrictive each year and are subject to frequent change, especially health regulatory requirements. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated provider network, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations.
Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Telemedicine Standards and Related Laws and Guidelines
 
The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and approvals, relating to, among other things, health provider licensure, adequacy and continuity of medical care, medical practice standards (including specific requirements when providing healthcare utilizing telemedicine technologies and consulting services among providers), medical records maintenance, personnel supervision, and prerequisites for the prescription of medication. The application of some of these laws to telemedicine is unclear and subject to differing interpretation. Further, laws and regulations specific to delivering medical services utilizing telemedicine technologies continues to evolve with some states incorporating modality and consent requirements for certain telemedicine encounters.
 
U.S. Corporate Practice of Medicine; Fee-Splitting
 
We contract with physician-owned professional associations and professional corporations to make available coordinated telemedicine services on our platform. In connection with these arrangements, we administer all non-clinical aspects of the telemedicine services to support the independent professional associations, professional corporations, and their health providers, including billing, scheduling and a wide range of other administrative and support services, and they pay us a pre-determined amount for those services. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws that prohibit fee-splitting (sharing of professional services income with nonprofessionals) or the practice of medicine by lay entities or unlicensed persons.
 
State corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws vary from state to state and are not always consistent among states. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad powers of interpretation, enforcement discretion by state regulators, and, in some cases, dated, yet still valid case law. Some of these requirements may apply to us or our affiliated provider network even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on the engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telemedicine to a resident of the state. However, regulatory authorities or other parties, including providers in our affiliated provider network, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee-splitting. In this event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our providers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, or the need to make changes to the arrangements with our affiliated provider network; each of which could interfere with our business or prompt other adverse consequences.
 
U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Federal Stark Law
 
Our affiliated provider network may be subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring beneficiaries of certain government programs to an entity providing “designated health services” if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an exception applies. The penalties for violating the Stark Law include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services, civil penalties for each violation, and possible exclusion from future participation in the federally funded healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be fined for each applicable arrangement or scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could harm our business.
 
9

 

Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 
We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, including fines per violation and damages of up to three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration, and imprisonment of up to ten years. Imposition of any of these remedies could harm our business. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.
False Claims Act
 
Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act. These investigations can be initiated not only by the government but also by a private party asserting direct knowledge of fraud. These “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits may be initiated against any person or entity alleging such person or entity has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, the improper retention of an overpayment for 60 days or more is also a basis for a False Claim Act action. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare programs. In addition, some states have adopted similar fraud, whistleblower and false claims provisions.
State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Most states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Other Healthcare Laws
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payors of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. These criminal statutes punish certain conduct resulting in the submission of claims to private payors that may also implicate the federal False Claims Act if resulting in claims to governmental health programs.

In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of co-payments and deductible amounts, that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries without appropriate justification can also be held liable under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud.
 
U.S. Federal and State Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
 
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, or PII, including health information. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, or PHI, and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Our affiliated network providers and our hospital, health system and other provider clients are all regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. Since the effective date of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule on September 23, 2013, HIPAA’s requirements are also directly applicable to the independent contractors, agents and other “business associates” of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI in connection with providing services to covered entities. SOC Telemed is a business associate under HIPAA when we are working on behalf of our affiliated medical groups and hospital, health system, and other provider clients.
 
Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. We must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to the HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate.
 
State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts.
 
HIPAA also required HHS to adopt national standards establishing electronic transaction standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically.
 
Many states in which we operate and in which patients of our clients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject.

In addition to HIPAA, state health information privacy and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting.
 
In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we enter into with our business associates, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our contractual partners following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others.
 
Reimbursement
 
Medicare
 
The Medicare program offers beneficiaries different ways to obtain medical benefits: (i) Medicare Part A, which covers, among other things, in-patient hospital, SNFs, home healthcare, and certain other types of healthcare services; (ii) Medicare Part B, which covers physicians’ services, outpatient services, durable medical equipment, and certain other types of items and healthcare services; (iii) Medicare Part C, also known as Medicare Advantage, which is a managed care option for beneficiaries who are entitled to Medicare Part A and enrolled in Medicare Part B; and (iv) Medicare Part D, which provides coverage for prescription drugs that are not otherwise covered under Medicare Part A or Part B for those beneficiaries that enroll.
 
Our affiliated provider network is reimbursed by the Part B and Part C programs for certain of the telemedicine services it provides to Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare coverage for telemedicine services is treated distinctly from other types of professional medical services and is limited by federal statute and subject to specific conditions of participation and payment pursuant to Medicare regulations, policies and guidelines, including the location of the patient, the type of service, and the modality for delivering the telemedicine service, among others.
 
Medicaid
 
Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states (or the state’s designated managed care or other similar organizations) under approved plans. Our affiliated provider network is reimbursed by certain state Medicaid programs for certain of the telemedicine services it provides to Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid coverage for telemedicine services varies by state and is subject to specific conditions of participation and payment.
 
Participation in Medicare/Medicaid Programs
 
Participation in the Medicare, including Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid programs is heavily regulated by federal and state (in the case of Medicaid) statute, regulation, policy, and guidance protocols. If a provider fails to comply substantially with the requirements for participating in the programs, the provider’s participation may be terminated and/or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed. Our affiliated network providers are enrolled with Medicare and certain Medicaid programs, and they also participate in arrangements administered by commercial payers under the Medicare Advantage program. In the ordinary course of business, we may from time to time be subject to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable government program participation. In addition to auditing compliance with program requirements, these audits can trigger, particularly when issues are identified, investigations, repayments, and requirements under certain of the U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws described above.
 
COVID-19 Waivers and Limited Statutory Changes
 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal and state governments have enacted legislation, promulgated regulations, and taken other administrative actions intended to assist healthcare providers seeking to utilize telemedicine methods in providing care to patients during the public health emergency. These measures include temporary relief from certain Medicare conditions of participation requirements for healthcare providers, temporary relaxation of licensure requirements for healthcare professionals by some states, temporary relaxation of privacy restrictions for telemedicine remote communications, and temporarily expanding the scope of services for which Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement is available during the emergency period. These changes have temporarily increased reimbursement available to our affiliated provider network for telemedicine services provided.

Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 226 employees, including 30 in research and development and 35 in sales, marketing and client success. Of these employees, all are located in the United States and approximately 53% are female and approximately 47% are male, with an average tenure across all employees of approximately 3.4 years. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We leverage a network of established, board-certified physicians and other provider specialists through our relationships with affiliated professional entities.
 
Our human capital management objective is to attract, retain and develop talent to deliver on our corporate strategy. We manage our human capital through the following programs:
 
Employee Health and Safety and COVID-19—During the COVID-19 pandemic, our primary focus has been on the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. In response to the pandemic, we mandated that our employees work from home, with limited exceptions of essential employees onsite. As the pandemic continues, the health and well-being of our workforce remains our top priority while we ensure productivity while working from home.
 
Compensation and Benefits—Our compensation and benefits program is designed to attract, retain and motivate employees. We offer competitive base salaries and a variety of short-term, long-term and commission-based incentive compensation programs to reward performance relative to key strategic and financial metrics. We also offer comprehensive benefit options, including retirement savings plans, medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, accident and critical illness insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts and legal insurance.
 
Engagement—We believe in continual improvement and use employee feedback to drive and improve processes and programs that support our clients and ensure a deep understanding of our employees’ experience. We conduct a confidential employee survey each year.
 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”)—We believe a diverse workforce and equitable and inclusive working environment are key factors in achieving better outcomes across all levels of our business. We value diverse perspectives and are proud of our diverse representation throughout the organization. To further this, we are launching a DEI Council in 2021 to generate ideas on how we can continue to create an inclusive, equitable and diverse environment and measure progress. We support employee-led efforts, and the DEI Council will be comprised of employees from across the Company. We believe it is equally important that leadership is engaged, and the DEI Council will be sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer, who have expressed commitment and support of increasing our DEI initiatives.
 
Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain qualified key personnel could harm our business” under Part I, Item 1A of this report.
