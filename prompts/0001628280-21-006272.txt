We have our finger on the pulse of outstanding travel, entertainment, and lifestyle experiences. For over 20 years we have worked in partnership with more than 5,000 top travel suppliers—our long-standing relationships give Travelzoo members access to irresistible deals.

Our Travelzoo website includes Local Deals and Getaways listings that allow our members to purchase vouchers for deals from local businesses such as spas, hotels and restaurants.

Revenues from the Travelzoo brand and business are generated primarily from advertising fees from two categories of revenue: Travel and Local. The “Travel” category consists of advertising or publishing revenues, primarily (a) listing fees paid by travel companies for the publishing of their offers on Travelzoo’s media properties and (b) commission from the sale of Getaways vouchers. Listing fees are based on audience reach, placement, number of listings, number of impressions, number of clicks, and actual sales. For publishing revenue, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the emails and delivery of the clicks, over the period of the placement of the advertising. The "Local" category consists of publishing revenue for negotiated high-quality deals from local businesses, such as restaurants, spas, shows, and other activities and includes Local Deals vouchers and entertainment offers. Jack’s Flight Club revenue is generated from paid subscriptions by members. Subscription options are quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. We recognize the revenue monthly pro rata over the subscription period.
In March 2020, Travelzoo exited its loss-making Asia Pacific business. The Company’s Asia Pacific business was classified as discontinued operations at March 31, 2020. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. On June 16, 2020, in connection with its Asia Pacific exit plan, the Company completed a sale of 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Travelzoo Japan K.K, a stock company organized under the laws of Japan (“Travelzoo Japan”), to Mr. Hajime Suzuki, the former General Manager of Travelzoo in Japan (the "Japan Buyer") for consideration of 1 Japanese Yen. The Company recorded approximately $128,000 loss upon disposal of Japan in the Consolidated Financial Statements in 2020. The parties also entered into a License Agreement, whereby Travelzoo Japan obtained a license to use the intellectual property of Travelzoo exclusively in Japan in exchange for quarterly royalty payments based on net revenue over a five (5) year term, with an option to renew. The Company recorded royalties from Travelzoo Japan on a one-quarter lag basis and did not recognize any royalties in 2020. An interest free loan was provided to the Japan Buyer for JPY 46 million (approximately $430,000) to be repaid over three (3) years which the Company recorded as other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, on August 24, 2020, the Company completed a sale of 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Travelzoo (Singapore) Pty Ltd, a limited company organized under the laws of Singapore (“Travelzoo Singapore”), to an unaffiliated entity, Finest Hotels Pty Ltd d/b/a Travelzoo, a limited company organized under the laws of Australia (“AUS Buyer”), which is fully owned by Mr. Julian Rembrandt, the former General Manager of Travelzoo in South East Asia and Australia for consideration of 1 Singapore Dollar. The parties also entered into a License Agreement, whereby the AUS Buyer obtained a license to use the intellectual property of Travelzoo exclusively in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore and non-exclusively in China and Hong Kong for quarterly royalty payments based upon net revenue over a five (5) year term, with an option to renew. There was no gain or loss from the sale of Travelzoo Singapore. The Company recorded royalties from Travelzoo Singapore on a one-quarter lag basis and did not recognize any royalties in 2020. Under the licensing agreements, Travelzoo's existing members in Australia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Singapore will continue to be owned by Travelzoo as the licensor.
The Company previously held a minority share equivalent to 33.7% in weekengo GmbH ("WeGo"), which the Company sold to trivago N.V. (“trivago”) on December 23, 2020. The original investment agreement with WeGo was executed in April 2018 (the “Original Investment Agreement”). At that time, Travelzoo invested $3.0 million in WeGo for a 25% ownership interest. In April 2019, the Company invested an additional $673,000 in WeGo, which increased the Company's ownership interest to 26.6%. In February 2020, Travelzoo signed an amended investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with WeGo, whereby the Company received additional shares (resulting in ownership of 33.7%) and in exchange, agreed to invest an additional $1.7 million if and when WeGo met certain performance targets. In connection with the Original Investment Agreement, WeGo agreed to spend approximately $2.0 million with the Company in marketing pursuant to an Insertion Order (the “Insertion Order”) and in connection with the Investment Agreement, WeGo agreed to spend an additional $1.8 million in marketing, once the additional payment was made by the Company (the “Second Insertion Order”).
The Company accounted for this private company investment using the equity method of accounting by recording its share of the results of WeGo in “Other income (expense)”, net on a one-quarter lag basis. In accounting for the initial investment, the Company allocated $1.0 million of its purchase price to tangible assets and allocated approximately $485,000 of the purchase price to technology-related intangible assets to be amortized over a 3-year life. The remaining $1.5 million of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill. 
As of the date of the transaction with trivago, WeGo had not achieved the necessary performance targets. As part of the Share Purchase Agreement, by and among Travelzoo (Europe) Limited, trivago, and the other shareholders of WeGo (the “trivago SPA”), the obligation of any additional payment by the Company was terminated. Per the trivago SPA, the Company sold all of its shares in WeGo to trivago for a total purchase price of approximately $2.9 million, of which $213,000 was placed in escrow for one year. WeGo agreed to pay in a lump sum the remaining amount outstanding pursuant to the Insertion Order of approximately $200,000. The payment was made in the first quarter of 2021. The Second Insertion Order and obligation for additional payments from WeGo for marketing were terminated. The Company acquired the domain name and trademark “weekend.com” in 2005 which was amortized over five years. Concurrently with the sale of the shares, the Company also sold the domain name and trademark “weekend.com” to trivago in exchange for a payment of $822,000.
In January 2020, Travelzoo acquired a majority stake in Jack’s Flight Club, which operates Jack’s Flight Club, a subscription service that provides members with information about exceptional airfares. As of December 31, 2020, Jack’s Flight Club had 1.7 million subscribers. Jack’s Flight Club’s revenues are generated by subscription fees paid by members. In June 2020, the Company renegotiated certain aspects of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 13, 2020 (the “SPA”), by and among Travelzoo, Jack’s Flight Club and the sellers party thereto (the “Sellers”) with the Sellers and reached a settlement for the outstanding Promissory Notes, dated as of January 13, 2020, by and between Travelzoo and each Seller (the “Promissory Notes”). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
On April 24, 2020 and May 5, 2020, the Company received $3.1 million and $535,000, respectively, pursuant to loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the Small Business Association. The loans have a maturity of two (2) years from the disbursement of the funds and an annual interest rate of 1%. The Company intends to use the funds from these loans only for the purposes included in the PPP, including payroll, employee benefits, and rent, and also intends to apply for forgiveness of a portion of the loans in compliance with the CARES Act. 
Historically, the Company managed its business geographically and operated in three reportable segments including Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. In 2020, the Company classified the results of its Asia Pacific segment as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements for current and prior periods presented. On January 13, 2020, Travelzoo agreed to the SPA with the Sellers of Jack’s Flight Club to purchase 60% of the Shares. Upon acquisition, the Company's chief operating decision maker reviewed and evaluated Jack's Flight Club as a separate segment. The Company currently has three reportable operating segments: Travelzoo North America, Travelzoo Europe and Jack’s Flight Club. Travelzoo North America consists of the Company’s operations in Canada and the U.S. Travelzoo Europe consists of the Company’s operations in France, Germany, Spain, and the U.K. Jack’s Flight Club consists of subscription revenue from premium members to access and receive flight deals from Jack’s Flight Club via email or via Android or Apple mobile applications. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Travelzoo North America operations were 65% of revenues, Travelzoo Europe operations were 28% of revenues and Jack’s Flight Club operations were 7% of our total revenues. Financial information with respect to our business segments and certain financial information about geographic areas appears in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Our principal business office is located at 590 Madison Avenue, 35th Floor, New York, New York 10022. 
Ralph Bartel, who founded Travelzoo and who is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, is the sole beneficiary of the Ralph Bartel 2005 Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of Azzurro Capital Inc. ("Azzurro"). As of December 31, 2020, Azzurro is the Company's largest stockholder, holding approximately 40% of the Company's outstanding shares. 
As of December 31, 2020, there were 11,364,689 shares of common stock outstanding. 
Travelzoo is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TZOO.” 
Our Industry 
The global outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020 is having an unprecedented impact on the global travel and hospitality industries, including severely restricting travel, dining and activities (through border closures, quarantine and stay-at-home requirements, travel restrictions, limited operations of restaurants, spas, hotels, airlines and travel agencies), as well as the level of economic activity around the globe. According to the World Trade & Tourism Council (WTCC), the global Travel & Tourism industry produced $8.9 trillion in value (10.3% of GDP) for the total global economy in 2019, and the adverse impact of COVID on the Travel and Tourism industry is expected to be $1.4 trillion in 2020 based on WTCC's June 2020 report. 
As the Company and many of our advertisers are part of the global travel and hospitality industries, the measures implemented to contain COVID have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our business. Many of the Company's advertising partners paused, canceled, and/or stopped advertising with the Company. Additionally, there has been a significant level of cancellations for the Company's hotel partners and travel package partners as well as refund requests for our vouchers with the Company’s hotel, restaurant and spa partners. The Company has modified its policies, particularly with our vouchers, to extend expiration dates and to allow for full refundability and have received positive feedback from our members. The Company will continue to adopt new policies as the situation evolves.
Our mission is to provide our audience with the highest quality information about the best travel, entertainment and local deals. Our revenues are generated from advertising fees. According to Zenith Media's forecast in July 2020, global advertising expenditure will shrink 9.1% to $572 billion due to the COVID pandemic in 2020, grow 5.8% to reach $606 billion in 2021 and 
$636 billion in 2022. We believe there is a sizable travel and entertainment industry in which we participate in that provides an opportunity to find high quality deals for our members. Based upon this outlook for the travel industry, we believe that we are well positioned with our operations in Europe and North America to capture high quality deals for our members. 
Aside from the global drop of advertising spending in 2020, digital advertising is expected to grow from 2019 to 2020. According to Zenith Media, digital advertising is expected to account for 51% of global advertising spending in 2020, more than half of total global advertising spending for the first time. In addition, according to the Kelsey Group's (BIA/Kelsey) new U.S. Local Media Forecast 2021, BIA/Kelsey forecasts total local advertising spending to be $134 billion in 2020, $138 billion in 2021, and to recover to pre-COVID 19 level in 2022. Digital advertising spending continues to increase its share of total local advertising spending by 3.7 percent from 2020 to 2021, growing to $62 billion in 2021. We believe that traditional media outlets such as newspapers, television and radio continue to be another medium for travel, entertainment and local businesses to advertise their offers, though the percentage spent on advertising in these traditional media outlets is decreasing. In addition, the continued rise in smart phones has changed the business rules for online marketing, with the consumption of online advertising rapidly moving to mobile devices. 
We believe that several factors are causing and will continue to cause travel, entertainment and local businesses to increase their spending on Internet and mobile advertising of offers: 
    The Internet Is Consumers' Preferred Information Source. Market research shows that the Internet has become consumers' preferred information source for travel. 
    Benefits of Internet Advertising vs. Print, TV and Radio Advertising. Internet advertising provides advertisers advantages compared to traditional advertising. These advantages include real-time listings, real-time updates, and performance tracking. See “Benefits to Travel, Entertainment and Local Businesses” below. 
    New Advertising Opportunities. The Internet allows advertisers to advertise their sales and specials in a fast, flexible, and cost-effective manner that has not been possible before. 
    Suppliers Selling Directly. We believe that many travel suppliers prefer to sell directly to consumers through suppliers' websites versus selling through travel agents. Internet advertising attracts consumers to suppliers' websites. 
    Growth of Mobile Advertising. Mobile advertising extends our products and services by providing mobile-specific features to mobile device users. As advertisers continue to shift budgets to mobile advertising, we continue to focus on developing easy-to-use mobile applications to help advertisers extend their reach, help create revenue opportunities for our advertisers, and deliver relevant and useful ads to users on the go. We continue to invest in improving users' access to our services through such devices.
Challenges Travel, Entertainment and Local Businesses Face and Limitations of Newspaper, TV and Radio Advertising 
We believe that travel, entertainment and local businesses often face the challenge of being able to effectively and quickly market and sell their excess inventory (i.e. airline seats, hotel rooms, cruise cabins, theater seats, spa appointments or restaurant seats that are likely to be unfilled). The success of marketing excess inventory can have a substantial impact on a company's profitability. Almost all costs of these services are fixed. That is, the costs do not vary significantly with sales. A relatively small amount of unsold inventory can have a significant impact on the profitability of a company. 
We believe that travel, entertainment and local businesses need a fast, flexible, and cost-effective solution for marketing excess inventory. The solution must be fast, because services are a quickly expiring commodity. The period between the time when a company realizes that there is excess inventory and the time when the service has become worthless is very short. The solution must be flexible, because the demand for excess inventory is difficult to forecast. It is difficult for travel, entertainment and local businesses to price excess inventory and to forecast the marketing effort needed to sell excess inventory. The marketing must be cost-effective, because excess inventory is often sold at highly discounted prices, which lowers margins. 
We believe that newspaper, TV and radio advertising, with respect to advertising excess inventory, suffers from a number of limitations which do not apply to the Internet: 
•typically, ads must be submitted 2 to 5 days prior to the publication or airing date, which makes it difficult to advertise last-minute inventory; 
•once an ad is published, it cannot be updated or deleted when an offer is sold out; 
•once an ad is published, the company cannot change a price or offer; 
•in many markets, the small number of newspapers, television companies, radio stations and other print media reduces competition, resulting in high rates for traditional advertising;  
•offline advertising does not allow for detailed performance tracking; and
•creative content can be very expensive to develop. 
Our Products and Services 
We provide airlines, hotels, cruise lines, vacation packagers, other travel suppliers, entertainment and local businesses with a fast, flexible, and cost-effective way to reach millions of Internet users. Our publications include the Travelzoo website, the Travelzoo Top 20 email newsletter, the Newsflash email alert service, the Local Deals and Getaways email alert services and Jack's Flight Club newsletter.

While our products provide advertising opportunities for travel, entertainment and local businesses, they also provide Internet users with a free source of information on current sales and specials from thousands of travel, entertainment and local businesses. 
As travel, entertainment and local businesses increasingly utilize the Internet to promote their offers, we believe that our products will enable them to take advantage of the lower cost and real-time communication enabled by the Internet. Our listing management software allows our advertisers to add, update, and delete special offer listings on a real-time basis. Our software also provides our advertisers with real-time performance tracking, enabling them to optimize their marketing campaigns. Mobile advertising extends our products and services by providing mobile-specific features to mobile device users. We are focused on developing easy-to-use mobile applications to help advertisers extend their reach, help create revenue opportunities for our customers, and deliver relevant and useful ads to users on the go. We continue to invest in improving users' access to our services through such devices. In addition, we continue to develop our hotel booking platform, which enables our users to more easily book hotel stays using our hotel deals presented on our website and mobile devices.

Some of our advertisers are:

Air Tahiti Nui | Hyatt Corporation 
Alaska Airlines | Icelandair 
Cathay Pacific Airways | InterContinental Hotels Group 
Club Med | Lion World Travel 
Emirates | Myrtle Beach Area Conventions & Visitors Bureau
Etihad | Princess Cruises 
Exoticca | Singapore Airlines 
Fairmont Hotels and Resorts | Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide 
Gate 1 Travel | United Airlines 

As discussed in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we did not have any advertisers that accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The agreements with certain advertisers are in the form of multiple insertion orders and merchant agreements from groups of entities under common control. 
In 2020, Travelzoo North America operations were 65% of revenues, Travelzoo Europe operations were 28% of revenues and Jack’s Flight Club operations were 7% of our total revenues. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Sales and Marketing 
As of December 31, 2020, our advertising sales force and sales support staff consisted of 71 employees worldwide. 
We currently utilize online marketing and direct marketing to promote our brand to consumers. In addition, we utilize an online marketing program to acquire new members for our email publications. We believe that we build brand awareness by product excellence that is promoted by word-of-mouth. We utilize sponsorships at industry conferences and public relations to promote our brands. 
Technology 
We have designed our technology to serve a large volume of Web traffic and send a large volume of emails in an efficient and scalable manner. 
We co-locate our production servers with Equinix, Inc. (“Equinix”), a global provider of hosting, network, and application services. Equinix's facilities include features such as power redundancy, multiple egress and peering to other ISPs, fire suppression and access to our own separate physical space. We believe our arrangements with Equinix will allow us to grow without being limited by our own physical and technological capacity, and will also provide us with sufficient bandwidth for our anticipated needs. Because of the design of our websites, our users are not required to download or upload large files from or to our websites, which allows us to continue increasing the number of our visitors and page views without adversely affecting our performance or requiring us to make significant additional capital expenditures. 
Competition 
We compete for advertising dollars with large Internet portal sites such as MSN and Verizon Media that offer listings or other advertising opportunities to travel, entertainment and local businesses. We compete with search engines like Google and Bing that offer pay-per-click listings. We compete with travel meta-search engines like Kayak and online travel and entertainment deal publishers. We compete with large online travel agencies like Expedia, Priceline and TripAdvisor that also offer advertising placements, airline travel comparisons, hotel bookings and capture consumer interest. We compete with companies like Groupon and Gilt City that sell vouchers for deals from local businesses such as spas, hotels, restaurants and 
activity companies. We compete via Jack’s Flight Club with airfare alert services, including other companies that provide this specifically like Scott’s Cheap Flights and larger companies who offer this as one of many services like Kayak. We expect to face increased competition from other Internet and technology-based businesses such as Yelp which has launched initiatives which are directly competitive to our Local Deals and Getaways products. In addition, we compete with newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that operate websites which provide advertising opportunities. We expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies, including print media companies and travel-focused start-ups, enter our market. We believe that the primary competitive factors are price, performance and audience quality. 
Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and larger advertiser bases than we do. Others have lower overhead and appeal to a different segment of the population. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their businesses or to offer more comprehensive solutions. 
New technologies could increase the competitive pressures that we face. The development of competing technologies by market participants or the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our competitive position. Competition could result in reduced margins on our services, loss of market share or less use of our products by our advertisers and consumers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business could be materially adversely affected. 
Government Regulation and Legal Uncertainties 
There are increasing numbers of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet, including laws and regulations relating to user privacy, liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, online content regulation, and domain name registration. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement, copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, obscenity, libel and personal privacy is uncertain and developing. 
Privacy Concerns. We are subject to a number of privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve over time, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which became effective in May 2018 and has resulted in greater compliance burdens for companies, including us, with users in Europe. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act was passed and creates new data privacy rights for users, which became effective in January 2020. Additionally, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield and required that the transfer of information between the EU and the US be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Complying with these varying national and international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Violations of privacy-related laws can also result in significant penalties. We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, and increase our costs and adversely affect our business.
Anti-Spam Legislation. The CAN-SPAM Act, a federal anti-spam law, pre-empts various state anti-spam laws and establishes a single standard for email marketing and customer communications. We believe that this law, on an overall basis, benefits our business as we do not use spam techniques or practices and may benefit now that others are prohibited from doing so. We are also subject to anti-spam laws in the various jurisdictions that we operate, including Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation. We continually review our practices to ensure our continued compliance with these regulations.
Domain Names. Domain names are the user's Internet “addresses.” The current system for registering, allocating and managing domain names has been the subject of litigation and of proposed regulatory reform. We have registered travelzoo.com, travelzoo.ca, travelzoo.co.jp, travelzoo.com.au, travelzoo.com.tw, travelzoo.co.uk, travelzoo.de, travelzoo.fr, and weekends.com, among other domain names, and have registered “Travelzoo” as a trademark in the United States, Canada, the European Union and certain countries throughout Asia Pacific. Because of these protections, it is unlikely, yet possible, that third parties may bring claims for infringement against us for the use of our domain name and trademark. In the event such claims are successful, we could lose the ability to use our domain names. There can be no assurance that our domain names will not lose their value, or that we will not have to obtain entirely new domain names in addition to or in lieu of our current domain names if changes in overall Internet domain name rules result in a restructuring in the current system of using domain names which include “.com,” “.net,” “.gov,” “.edu” and other extensions. 
Jurisdictions. Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that, although our transmissions over the Internet originate primarily in California, the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate our business activities. In addition, because our service is available over the Internet in multiple states and foreign countries, these jurisdictions may require us to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of these states or foreign countries, which could subject us to additional taxes and other regulations.
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our brand names, including Travelzoo, Top 20 and Jack's Flight Club. If we were unable to protect the Travelzoo, Top 20 and Jack's Flight Club brand names, our business could be materially adversely affected. We rely upon a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We have registered the Travelzoo and Top 20 trademarks, among others, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered the Travelzoo and Travelzoo Top 20 trademarks with the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market of the European Community. We have registered the Travelzoo trademark in Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Jack’s Flight Club has registered the Jack’s Flight Club trademark in the United States and the European Union. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, however, may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information. 
We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. The laws of other countries in which we may market our services in the future are uncertain and may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 236 employees in Travelzoo North America and Travelzoo Europe and all were considered full-time. None of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
