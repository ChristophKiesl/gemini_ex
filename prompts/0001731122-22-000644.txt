ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Overview
 
TG Venture Acquisition Corp. (the “Company” or “TG Venture”) is a blank check company whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to initially focus our search on identifying a prospective target business in the technology industries in the United States and other developed countries, with a special focus within the space technology, financial technology, technology, media and telecom (“TMT”) industries and related sectors. Though our sponsor is a Hong Kong company, a majority of our management are located outside of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and we will not undertake our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
Corporate Information
 
TG Venture was incorporated in Delaware in 2021. Our principal executive offices are located at 1390 Market Street, Suite 200 San Francisco, CA 94102. Our corporate website is https://tgventureacquisition.com/
 
Recent Developments
 
On November 5, 2021, TG Venture consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 11,500,000 units (the “Units”), which included 1,500,000 Units upon a full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a “Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $115,000,000.
 
On November 5, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 5,500,000 Warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Tsangs Group Holdings Limited (the “Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $5,500,000. Each of the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share.
 
A total of $117,300,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

PROPOSED BUSINESS
 
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated on February 8, 2021 as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the IPO. Though our sponsor is a Hong Kong company, a majority of our management are located outside of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and we will not undertake our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.
 
The Company plans to take a differentiated approach compared to the recent plethora of special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) issuances by focusing its initial business combination search on the following industry segments:
 

● | Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning
--+----------------------------------------------------
● | Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”) 
● | Edge Computing 
● | Quantum Computing 
● | Virtual Reality (“VR”) 
● | Augmented Reality 
● | Blockchain 
● | Space Exploration 
● | Internet of Things 
● | 5G Data and Telecommunications 
● | Cybersecurity 
● | AI Powered Drug Discovery 
● | Hydrogen Energy 
● | Electrical Vehicle Charging Infrastructure 
● | Financial Technology 
● | Technology, media and telecom TMT 

 
We will not be limited to any particular industry, sector or geographic region in our identification and acquisition of a business combination target, except that we will not undertake our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). However, we believe that we have created a significant competitive advantage compared to other SPACs that have chosen to pursue potential business combinations with a much wider targeted mandate. With nearly 420 active SPACs as of June 11, 2021 still searching for a business combination, target companies have never had more choices nor do they necessarily know which SPACs to approach. By assembling a management team and board of directors with highly successful operating and investing track records in the industries we seek to pursue, we believe that we will be the preferred SPAC partner for the highest quality assets within our focus areas. In addition, our management team and board of directors have vast experience both investing in and leading various organizations, both public and private, and domestic and international government agencies. This experience base affords us the opportunity to leverage our robust network of contacts to execute our focused strategy across the globe.

We also intend to concentrate our efforts on identifying businesses with enterprise values less than $1.25 billion. We believe that this segment of the market is underserved and has greater valuation arbitrage opportunities and more favorable competitive dynamics compared to many SPACs that are targeting assets with enterprise values greater than $2 billion. In 2020, the average SPAC initial public offering raised gross proceeds of $336 million. Raising less capital in our IPO will enable us to offer target companies at our preferred valuation range a more compelling transaction structure versus larger SPACs that may be seeking a similar asset. In addition, we can maintain a higher degree of agility and flexibility should we choose to pursue a business with an enterprise value greater than $1.25 billion by leveraging our public stock as additional currency for the merger consideration.
 
We believe we have the right team, strategy and market opportunity to identify, acquire and manage a “best-in-class” business with the ultimate mandate of delivering an attractive return to all stakeholders.
 
Our co-Founders, Pui Lan Patrick Tsang (Chairman and CEO) and Philip Rettger (CFO and Director), are industry pioneers, visionary investors, serial entrepreneurs and deeply experienced operators with an extensive deal-making history. Over the course of their careers, Mr. Tsang and Mr. Rettger have founded, controlled, assembled and financed enterprises across various segments and industries, including cable, broadcast, cellular, fiber, satellite, communications technologies, wireless broadband, energy and technology invention and project development. As pioneering investors, they have brought value and profits to stockholders of numerous businesses through rollups, acquisitions, mergers, both independently and in partnerships with other public corporations, and private equity firms.
 
Mr. Tsang and Mr. Rettger have shown repeated foresight in identifying and investing in key trends that have shaped the global space technology, financial technology and TMT markets. In bringing vision into reality, they have consistently built cohesive executive teams and culture-led organizations to execute within competitive markets.
 
Mr. Tsang currently serves as Chairman of Tsangs Group, a fourth-generation Single-Family Office. Tsangs Group has made concentrated investments in companies, businesses and assets across multiple sectors, and currently has operations in over 50 countries spanning 6 continents. In most circumstances, Tsangs Group prefers to make investments in a project of early stage in a particular sector and subsequently seek to make complementary investments in that sector to achieve improved economies of scale, market penetration and operating efficiencies.
 
The co-Founders have proven their extensive deal-making abilities throughout their careers and created significant stockholder value across numerous high-profile transactions including:
 
Tsangs Group became the early-stage investor and strategic advisor to Pulse Evolution Group in 2018, which subsequently acquired the German listed Nexway Group, and the combined group rebranded as FaceBank Group in 2018. On April 2020, FaceBank Group completed the merger with fuboTV, the largest vMVPD streaming platform in the US with primary focus on channels that distribute live sports including NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL and international soccer. fuboTV became successfully listed on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2020 (FUBO:US). When comparing with the valuation at the time when Tsangs Group came in, the share price of fuboTV reached $62 at the end of December 2020; Tsangs Group achieved an approximately 300 times return in 2 years on this investment.
 
Under the leadership of Patrick Tsang (Chairman of our sponsor), the Original IPO Opportunities SP1 (formerly known as OX Global Fund SPC-OX Global Fund IPO Opportunities SP1), managed by Original Asset Management Limited (wholly owned by Patrick Tsang and a SFC  regulated company) has been actively involved in the sourcing and investment in the highly sought-after IPO investment opportunities in Asia, Japan, Korea and the US. The performance of the Fund in 2020 was quite promising with a return of 42.89% for the year then ended.
 
Patrick Tsang founded Vale International Group Limited, which changed its name to Fragrant Prosperity Holdings Limited. It was established to undergo acquisitions of businesses in the financial and technology sectors in Europe and Asia. It has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since September 2016. Patrick came in as GBP0.0233 per share and the share price was GBP0.07 on April 10, 2021, achieving a return of 200%.
 
Tsangs Group was an investor of Live Company Group (“LVCG”), a leading Live Events and Entertainment company. LVCG was founded in 2017 and is trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. LVCG acquired BRICKLIVE Group and the Parallel Live Group. BRICKLIVE holds events that have received widespread acclaim of partner-driven shows designed to showcase the benefits of LEGO-brand toys as an educational tool worldwide. During the very short period of 9 months, Tsangs Group achieved a total return of 33%.

Permission Required from the Chinese Authorities for a Business Combination
 
As a Delaware corporation with no operations in China, we are not required to obtain permission from any Chinese authorities to operate and we do not expect that permission will be required from the Chinese authorities in connection our business combination since we will not undertake our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
 
Industry Opportunity
 
While we may acquire a business in any industry, our focus will be on the space technology, financial technology and TMT industries in the United States and other developed countries (excluding mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau). There are a number of emerging technology sub-sections where we believe superior acquisition opportunities may be identified and secured through management’s network and connections. These include, but are not limited to:

● | Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning. Technologies that enable computers to autonomously learn, deduce and act, through utilization of large data sets. These technologies enable development of systems that collect and store massive amounts of data, and analyze that content to make decisions based on probability and statistical analysis. Applications for Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning include speech recognition, computer vision, robotic control and accelerating processes in the empirical sciences where large data sets are essential.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”). Automated or remote-controlled mechanical devices and technology. This includes machinery programmed to perform repetitive tasks such as manufacturing and loading; precision tasks such as surgery or semiconductor production; and remote-operated movement or travel, such as that provided by unmanned aerial vehicles, subsea vehicles and land vehicles. 
● | Edge Computing. Distributed IT architecture which moves computing resources from clouds and data centers as close as possible to the originating source. Edge computing reduces latency requirements while processing data and saving network costs. The edge can be the router, ISP, routing switches, integrated access devices (IADs), multiplexers, etc. Near-term applications include smart homes and the cloud gaming industry. 
● | Quantum Computing. The exploitation of collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computation. Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers. Real-world use includes artificial intelligence, cryptography, financial modelling, molecular modelling, particle physics and weather forecasting. 
● | Virtual Reality (“VR”). Hardware and software technologies providing an immersive, three-dimensional user experience in a virtual world. VR environments are provided through a computer screen augmented with wearable devices, such as head-mounted stereo-optical displays or sensor-embedded gloves. VR also includes remote communication environments, where users interact with each other through computer-generated avatars. 


● | Augmented Reality. Technology which overlays superimposed computer-generated images over a view of the real-world, thus altering and/or enhancing the current perception of reality. Companies in this space are involved with hardware and software development, content creation, and distribution related to AR products. This includes headsets, eye tracking technology, smart glasses, video games, mobile applications, training programs, advertising, and commercial and retail applications that utilize AR technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Blockchain. The blockchain refers to a digital ledger that provides a secure way of making and recording transactions, agreements and contracts. Blockchains are unique in that their ledger is distributed across a network of computers such that it cannot be controlled by a single entity and has no single point of failure. This space includes companies involved in developing blockchain applications related to smart contracts, crowd funding, supply chain auditing, cryptocurrency, identity management, intellectual property, and file storage. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Space Exploration. The provision of services, scientific research, or technology related to spaceflight, satellites, or space exploration. This includes micro-satellites, nano-satellites, ground station networks, rocket technology, payload systems, spacecraft development, satellite imagery, satellite telecommunications, space-based data, space materials, space tourism, and asteroid mining. 
● | Internet of Things. Products that are enabled with sensors and actuators embedded in physical objects and/or software that uses this sensor data to improve the user experience or allows for sharing this data with a network of other devices, often using the same Internet Protocol that connects the Internet. 
● | 5G Data and Telecommunications. In telecommunications, 5G is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, and is the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most current cellphones. Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected the networks will increasingly be used as general internet service providers for laptops and desktop computers, competing with existing ISPs such as cable internet, and also will make possible new applications in internet of things (IoT) and machine-to-machine areas. 4G cellphones are not able to use the new networks, which require 5G enabled wireless devices.
● | Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity refers to the practice of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability (ICA) of information. Cybersecurity is comprised of an evolving set of tools, risk management approaches, technologies, training, and best practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attacks or unauthorized access. Common types of cybersecurity include network security, data loss prevention, cloud security, intrusion detection/prevention systems, identity and access management and antivirus/anti-malware solutions. 
● | AI Powered Drug Discovery. AI and other innovative technologies that use data from multiple sources can enable more precise, targeted treatments that will help shift the health ecosystem toward a future where medicine is personalized, predictive, preventative, and participatory. While these solutions focus mostly on transforming the process of small-molecule research, they are also showing potential in the identification of new biologics such as therapeutic antibodies against cancer, fibrosis, and other diseases. 


● | Electrical Vehicle Charging Infrastructure. The number of charging outlets has expanded as awareness and adoption of electric vehicles has increased, and this trend is expected to continue and accelerate as large automakers continue to make investments into electric vehicle development. Includes companies building EV charging infrastructure to support the electrification of the mobility sector. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hydrogen Energy. Hydrogen is potentially promising as an energy storage and delivery system, due to its zero emissions output (other than water) and high energy density per weight unit. Companies in this space are developing methods, machines, and materials to use hydrogen for multiple purposes. Key technologies represented here include the design and manufacture of hydrogen fuel cells, new methods of hydrogen production, hydrogen storage, hydrogen fuel infrastructure, and hydrogen-powered mobility solutions. 
● | Financial Technology. FinTech is disruptive to our life every day. The power dynamics in the payments industry are changing as consumers shift from cash and checks to digital payment methods and the COVID-19 Pandemic accelerated digitization. The payments industry demonstrated its adaptability, springing quickly to serve as a crisis response co-partner for individuals and businesses, assist in distributing government stimulus payments, and help customers, merchants, and corporate clients transact in contactless ways. Favorable trends such as the shift to contactless payments, the growing adoption of digital wallets, and the more widespread use of B2B payments automation are lifting the industry’s prospects.
● | Technology, media and telecom. The TMT, sector is an industry grouping that includes the majority of companies focused on new technologies. The TMT sector is sometimes also referred to as technology, media, and communications (“TMC”).

Business Strategy
 
We believe the future success of the capital markets for space technology, financial technology and TMT, companies is dependent on new company formation, the sustainability of robust private market funding and an increased willingness of private technology companies to become publicly-traded and therefore become available to a broader universe of investors who can benefit from their disruption and growth. Our mission is to create an alternative path to a traditional IPO for disruptive and agile technology companies to achieve their long-term objectives and overcome key deterrents to becoming public. By leveraging our extensive operational experience and network, we believe we can provide a number of benefits to potential targets and public market investors that can potentially lead to attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns in the public markets. Though our sponsor is a Hong Kong company, a majority of our management are located outside of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and we will not undertake our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
 
Our strategy revolves around seeking targets in the following sectors:
 

● | Technologies including but not limited to:
--+-------------------------------------------


○ | Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Machine Learning 
--+--------------------------------------------------------
○ | Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”) 
○ | Edge Computing 
○ | Quantum Computing 
○ | Virtual Reality (“VR”) 
○ | Augmented Reality 
○ | Blockchain 
○ | Space Exploration 
○ | Internet of Things 
○ | 5G Data and Telecommunications 
○ | Cybersecurity 
○ | AI Powered Drug Discovery 
○ | Hydrogen Energy 
○ | Electrical Vehicle Charging Infrastructure 


● | Financial Technology
--+---------------------


● | Technology, media and telecom, or TMT
--+--------------------------------------

 
We also intend to concentrate our efforts on identifying businesses with enterprise values of less than $1.25 billion and may be located in the United States and other developed countries. We believe this segment of the market has greater sourcing inefficiencies, as companies of this scale and geographic “footprint” tend to be overlooked. Our core competencies and international rolodex will allow us to identify opportunities earlier, move faster, and catalyze more accretive value creation strategies compared to our competition. In addition to potential business combinations, we may identify on our own, we also anticipate that our focused mandate and pedigreed team will generate inbound leads from various sources outside of our network, including investment market participants, private equity and venture capital groups, investment banking firms, consultants, and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.

Our management team possesses the following characteristics necessary to execute on our business strategy:
 


● | Extensive leadership experience: Our management team and board of directors have held leadership positions at and invested in some of the world’s most cutting edge and forward-thinking public and private companies in our core focus areas. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Access to proprietary deal flow: As both lead investors and operators with deep relationships across the globe, we have access to specific opportunities before they become more widely available to others. 
● | Deep-pocketed network: Our network includes asset managers who collectively manage billions of dollars, allowing us to support fully the strategies we wish to implement and provide target companies with deal certainty. 
● | Focus on aligning interests: We have a deep commitment to providing win-win scenarios for all stakeholders and intend to focus on generating attractive outcomes for our investors as well as the target company’s stockholders, employees and customers.
● | Extensive investing and M&A experience: Our team has completed numerous investments and transactions with companies through their lifecycle, including seed and growth equity rounds, IPOs and integrating acquisitions. 
● | Track record of value creation: We have a long history of generating substantial risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders across public and private markets and through many business cycles over the last several decades. 

 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in the space technology, financial technology, and TMT industries in the United Stated and other developed countries, we intend to identify and acquire a business that could benefit from a hands-on owner with extensive operational experience and that presents potential for an attractive risk-adjusted return profile under our stewardship.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
We intend to leverage what we believe is a competitive advantage in sourcing potential targets that will materially benefit from our unique expertise and where we are best situated to augment the value of the business following the completion of the initial business combination.
 
We believe our management team is well positioned to identify unique opportunities across the space technology, financial technology and TMT industries, but we will not undertake our initial business combination with an entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). Our selection process will leverage our relationships with leading company founders, executives of private and public companies, venture capitalists and growth equity funds, in addition to the extensive industry and geographical reach of TG Venture’s platforms, which we believe should provide us with a key competitive advantage in sourcing potential business combination targets. Given our profile and thematic approach, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources.
 
We also believe that our founders’ reputation, experience and track record of making investments especially in the space technology, financial technology and TMT industries will make us a preferred partner for these potential targets.
 
10


We also anticipate offering the following benefits to our business combination partner:
 

● | Partnership with our management team and board of directors who have extensive and proven experiences in leading, operating and investing in world-class companies in our focus areas;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Access to our vast network of contacts and relationships across the globe to accelerate growth initiatives; 
● | Access to deep-pocketed, fundamental investors who can provide confidence with respect to deal closure and long-term support of implementing management’s strategy; 
● | A listed public currency for future acquisitions and quick access to the capital markets to support organic growth opportunities; 
● | Ability for the existing management team to retain control and accelerate their long-term vision. 

 
Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines to evaluate prospective target businesses. We may, however, decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire one or more businesses that we believe:
 

● | can be leaders or pioneers in space technology, financial technology and TMT; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | are technology first companies with strong portfolios of intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how; 
● | can benefit from the extensive networks and insights we have built. 
● | can use technology to drive meaningful operational improvements and efficiency gains; 
● | are ready to operate in the scrutiny of public markets, with strong management, corporate governance and reporting policies in place; 
● | will likely be well received by public investors and are expected to have good access to the public capital markets; 
● | are at an inflection point, such as those requiring additional management expertise, innovation to develop new products or services, improvement of financial performance or growth through a business combination; 
● | have significant embedded and/or underexploited expansion opportunities; 
● | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the market, based on our company-specific analysis and due diligence review; for a potential target company, this process will include, among other things, a review and analysis of the company’s capital structure, quality of earnings, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, material contracts, and industry background and trends; and
● | will offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our stockholders. 

 
We may use other criteria and guidelines as well. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that fact in our stockholder communications related to the acquisition. As discussed elsewhere in this Report, this would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
NASDAQ rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We expect to be able to comply with NASDAQ rules and by reason of our arrangements with ThinkEquity, there are no deferred underwriting commissions. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to NASDAQ rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
 
11


We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of NASDAQ’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
Our Business Combination Process
 
In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We will also seek to utilize the expertise of our management team in the space technology, financial technology and TMT industries and evaluating operating projections, financial projections and determining the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business.
 
Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Certain of our officers and directors presently have fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity, including Mr. Patrick Tsang, our CEO, who is also an independent director of Model, another blank check company. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
 
In addition, members of our team may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
 
12


Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
 
Our executive offices are located at 1390 Market Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, California 94102, and our telephone number is (628) 251-1369. Our executive offices are provided to us by our sponsor. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.
