Overview
 We are a microbiome therapeutics platform company developing a novel class of biological drugs, which we refer to as Ecobiotic® microbiome therapeutics. The human microbiome is an ecology of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and viruses, that, when unhealthy, or dysbiotic, can leave the body more susceptible to infections, metabolic disorders, allergies, autoimmune disease, inflammation and other serious conditions. Our drugs are designed to restore health by repairing the function of a dysbiotic microbiome. We are initially focused on implementing our microbiome therapeutics platform to develop Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics that treat dysbiosis in the colonic microbiome, one of the most diverse microbial ecologies in the human body. 
 The human microbiome is one of the richest and most diverse ecosystems on earth, with a population of more than 100 trillion microorganisms that live in our intestines, mouth, skin and elsewhere in the body. In a healthy, symbiotic state the colonic microbiome plays an important role in human health, helping the body digest food, resist pathogens, regulate the metabolic systems, develop and regulate the immune system and synthesize essential nutrients and vitamins. However, the colonic microbiome may change in composition for a variety of reasons, including in response to long-term or high-dose antibiotics or following gastrointestinal infection. These changes in composition may result in the loss of key microbes, resulting in a state of dysbiosis. Dysbiosis of the colonic microbiome is associated with a wide range of serious conditions and infections, such as gastrointestinal infection and inflammatory and metabolic diseases.
 While the study of the human microbiome is not new, the scientific community’s understanding of the microbiome, and the colonic microbiome in particular, has been significantly advanced through metagenomics, which has enabled the broader understanding of the human microbiome at the organismal, functional and community level. Scientific research has correlated dysbiosis in the colonic microbiome with numerous diseases and conditions in humans and in animal models, including: infections, metabolic disorders, allergies, autoimmune disease, inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, and neurological disorders. Information regarding the impact of the colonic microbiome on various disease states continues to grow rapidly.
 We are developing a new approach to treating disease by restoring a dysbiotic colonic microbiome to a healthy state using our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics. Our approach is premised on the hypothesis that the proximal cause of many diseases is a dysbiosis in the natural state of the colonic microbiome that perpetuates the conditions that allow disease to take hold and flourish. We believe that the restoration of a dysbiotic colonic microbiome using rationally designed therapeutics represents a paradigm shift in the approach to treating the underlying disease. Our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics, which are derived from our microbiome therapeutics platform, are rationally designed ecological compositions, consisting of discrete combinations of beneficial microorganisms with designed functional properties that provide the ability to re-establish keystone features of a functional microbiome in settings of disease. There are currently no FDA-approved therapeutics that are designed to restore the microbiome to a healthy state.
 Our approach to discovery and design is based on an iterative bedside-to-bench-to-bedside drug discovery strategy that begins with data on the human microbiome that we gather from clinical studies. From these data, we identify the microbiological and functional differences between a healthy and a diseased microbiome, which we then use to rationally design potential Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics. After further in-lab testing, selected Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic candidates are then studied in clinical trials. We apply a comparative genomic systems biology framework that leverages proprietary computational, microbiological and screening capabilities to design lead candidates targeted at these microbiological and functional deficiencies. We are able to apply this framework and experience to clinical data sets from published studies and those generated with our collaborators, as well as to the proprietary clinical data set we have generated through our SER-109 clinical trials. We believe we can utilize our knowledge and data to design Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics to treat various medical conditions, such as inflammatory and metabolic diseases. We also have advanced capabilities in the production and formulation of vegetative colonic bacteria spore forms of bacteria into therapeutics. We believe that the combination of experience, proprietary data and proprietary know-how that comprise our microbiome therapeutics platform provides us with a competitive advantage in the design and development of microbiome therapeutics. Further, our approach and platform, which enable the rational design, testing, optimization, manufacturing and formulation of Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics, provide a framework that we believe can significantly reduce the time typically required to advance therapeutics to the clinic.
 Using our microbiome therapeutics platform, we are developing our lead clinical product candidate, SER-109, which is designed to durably repair dysbiosis in the colonic microbiome in the setting of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, or CDI. CDI is most often caused by the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which induce dysbiosis of the microbiome causing susceptibility to infection by Clostridium difficile, or C. difficile, a spore forming bacterium. CDI may lead to debilitating diarrhea in infected 
 4

individuals, but can also lead to more severe outcomes, such as inflammation of the colon (colitis), toxic megacolon and death. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, has identified CDI as one of the top three most urgent antibiotic-resistant bacterial threats in the United States. It is the most common cause of hospital acquired infection in the United States and has overtaken methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA. CDI is responsible for the deaths of approximately 29,000 Americans each year. Based on an epidemiological study conducted by the CDC, the incidence of CDI in the United States, based on a positive toxin or molecular assay in patients who did not have a positive result in the previous eight weeks, was estimated to be 453,000 (95% confidence interval, 397,100 to 508,500) (Lessa et. al., Burden of Clostridium difficile Infection in the United States, New England J. of Medicine, 2015). While the epidemiological data are varied outside the United States, we believe that, due to the widespread use of antibiotics, CDI is a growing global disease. The standard of care for CDI is to treat with antibiotics. In many cases, antibiotic treatments may resolve the acute infection caused by C. difficile. However, these antibiotic treatments kill bacteria broadly, inducing a dysbiosis of the microbiome and potentially making patients more susceptible to a recurrence of CDI. For those patients who experience a recurrence of their CDI, we believe it is this dysbiosis of the microbiome, not the presence of C. difficile, which is the proximal cause of disease. Published data suggests that the risk of recurrence is approximately 25% after the primary CDI, 40% after a first recurrence and greater than 60% for those experiencing two or more recurrences. 
 SER-109 is a bacterial spore ecology consisting of an average of approximately 50 bacterial species derived from healthy donors’ fecal matter. SER-109 is designed to prevent further recurrences of CDI in patients suffering from recurrent CDI by restoring the dysbiotic microbiome to a state of health. If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, SER-109 could be a first-in-field oral microbiome drug. In our Phase 1b/2 clinical study of SER-109 in recurrent CDI patients, 97% of patients achieved a clinical cure, which we defined as the absence of CDI requiring antibiotic treatment during the eight-week period after SER-109 dosing; 87% of patients met the predefined endpoint of preventing recurrent CDI within eight weeks following administration of SER-109. A subsequent randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical study was conducted in 89 subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SER-109 in adults with recurrent CDI. In that study, 44% of subjects (26 of 59) who received SER-109 experienced a recurrence at the 8 week endpoint compared to 53% of subjects (16 of 30) who received placebo, a result that was not statically significant. SER-109 was generally safe and well-tolerated in both the Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 studies. The most common adverse events observed in the Phase 2 clinical study for SER-109 and placebo, respectively, were diarrhea (25% vs. 14%), abdominal pain (22% vs. 14%), flatulence (12% vs. 3%), and nausea (10% vs. 10%). No drug-related serious adverse events were observed. In order to understand the difference in outcome between the Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies, we conducted an analysis of the available clinical, microbiome and chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC data. This root-cause investigation looked at the clinical trial population, study conduct, and diagnostic testing used for study inclusion and endpoint analysis, assessed clinical specimens for genomic and metabolomic biomarkers that might give insight into SER-109’s efficacy and potency, reviewed manufacturing procedures and processes, performed retrospective analysis using high-resolution whole metagenomics sequencing of Phase 1b/2 clinical study stool samples, and reviewed analytical methods to identify factors that may have led to different outcomes between Phase 1b/2 clinical and Phase 2 clinical study. We have now identified specific factors that we believe contributed to the Phase 2 clinical study results, including issues related to both the accurate diagnosis of C. difficile recurrent infection, and potential suboptimal dosing of certain subjects in the study. 
 The SER-109 analyses were recently shared with the FDA. Based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study in approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection. Study participants will be randomized 1:1 between SER-109 and placebo and will receive a dose that is approximately 10-fold higher than in the first Phase 2, administered over three consecutive days. Diagnosis of C. difficile infection for both study entry and for endpoint analysis will be confirmed by C. difficile cytotoxin assay, compared to the first Phase 2, where most patients were diagnosed by PCR. The new study will evaluate patients for 24 weeks and the primary endpoint will compare the C. difficile recurrence rate in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing. The FDA has agreed that this new trial may qualify as a pivotal study with achievement of a persuasive clinical effect and addressing FDA requirements, including clinical and statistical factors, an adequately sized safety database, and certain CMC parameters. 
 
We progressed our drug discovery and development platforms with the successful initiation in July 2016 of a Phase 1b study for SER-262, a rationally designed ecology of spore forming bacteria to be used following antibiotic treatment for primary CDI to prevent an initial recurrence of CDI. We believe there are several advantages to using a synthetic approach to developing microbiome therapeutics.  Synthetically derived product candidates can be scaled up to meet global demand in a reliable and reproducible manner, with well-defined characteristics.  Based on our metagenomics expertise, proprietary in silico algorithms, extensive proprietary bacterial library, and advanced manufacturing capabilities, we believe we can design synthetically produced microbiome therapeutic candidates for specific target indications.   We believe, our capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage in developing synthetically produced microbiome therapies.  SER-262 was designed based on clinical insights from our SER-109 program and an understanding of the mechanism by which the microbiome protects against gastrointestinal infections.  The strains included in SER-262 were selected based on criteria that included analysis of human microbiome data, efficacy in animal models of CDI, and bacterial strain level characterization for safety characteristics and microbial function. We screened over 100 drug candidates in a mouse model of C. difficile and the final composition was also evaluated for manufacturability.  These data were submitted to the FDA as part of our Investigational New Drug, or IND, which was cleared in June 2016. The Phase 1b study, a randomized, placebo controlled dose 
 5

escalation study was initiated in July 2016. The study is expected to enroll up to 60 patients who have experienced a first episode of CDI. The primary endpoints of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-262 in subjects with primary CDI and to compare the CDI recurrence rate between the SER-262 and placebo groups up to 8 weeks after treatment. Top-line data from the SER-262 Phase 1b study is expected in the second half of 2017. 
 We initiated our Phase 1b clinical study for our IBD drug candidate, SER-287, in December 2015 and are enrolling subjects with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, or UC, a form of IBD, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SER-287 added to standard of care treatment. The randomized, placebo-controlled multiple dose Phase 1b study of SER-287 is expected to enroll up to 55 subjects with active mild-to-moderate UC, who are failing current therapies. The clinical development of SER-287 to treat UC is supported by preclinical studies in multiple animal models of colitis that provide evidence that SER-287 administration results in reduced pathology.  Published clinical reports furthermore suggest that modulation of the microbiome through repetitive fecal microbiota transplants may lead to meaningful clinical response in certain UC patients. The primary endpoints of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-287, compare the change in the microbiome composition versus placebo, and determine engraftment of SER-287 bacteria following SER-287 treatment. The study will also evaluate clinical response, complete remission, and endoscopic improvement, as well as metabolomic, and immunological findings. Top-line data from the SER-287 Phase 1b study is expected in the second half of 2017.
 
We are also designing and developing SER-301, a synthetic Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic candidate for the treatment of IBD.  The design is being driven by insights from successful fecal microbiota transplants for UC conducted by our academic collaborators and will leverage microbiome and metabolomic data gained from the ongoing Phase 1b study of SER-287.  The SER-301 program also benefits from what we have and will learn about synthetic Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic development in our SER-262 program. 
 In addition to our CDI and IBD product candidates, we are utilizing our microbiome therapeutics platform to develop SER-155 for the prevention of transplant-related mortality (due to infection and graft versus host disease, or, GvHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or allo-HSCT, recipients. Published clinical evidence from our collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center shows that allo-HSCT patients with reduced microbiome diversity primarily due to antibiotic exposure are far more likely to die due to infection and/or lethal GvHD (Taur et al., Blood, 2014; Jenq et al, Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 2015).  Notably, in one patient who participated in the SER-109 Phase 1b/2 clinical study, drug-resistant organisms and other potentially pathogenic species were eliminated from the patient’s gastrointestinal tract (Khanna et al., Journal of Infectious Disease, 2016).  The potential role of the microbiome in immuno-oncology therapies has also been reported on in recent publications on studies conducted in humans and animal models (Dublin K. et al., Nature, 2016; Vetizou M. et al., Science 2015; Sivan A. et al., Science 2015). We are also applying our platform to potentially develop Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics to enhance the safety and efficacy of immune-oncology agents including checkpoint inhibitors used in cancer treatments.  We are also researching Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as early-stage, non-insulin dependent diabetes, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), obesity and metabolic syndrome. Research in these indications is focused on developing Ecobiotic drugs that address specific functional defects in the microbiome, including the specific metabolic products made by the microbes.  We believe this approach may enable pursuit of a range of disorders including various forms of liver disease and rare genetic diseases of metabolism.

We have assembled a world class group of scientists, clinicians, directors and investors, who have established our leadership in the field of microbiome therapeutics. We were co-founded by Drs. Noubar Afeyan, David Berry and Geoffrey von Maltzahn of Flagship Pioneering, the innovation foundry of Flagship Ventures, which has founded over 25 life sciences companies. Through Flagship Pioneering’s contribution of foundational scientific concepts and intellectual property, assembly of our management team and critical early-stage support, we launched as the first company focused on the ecological nature of the microbiome. Led by Dr. Roger Pomerantz, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, our experienced management team possesses core capabilities in microbiome therapeutics, infectious disease, drug development, commercialization, CMC, public company management and finance. Dr. Pomerantz, an infectious disease physician-scientist, has extensive experience in infectious disease drug development and commercialization, licensing and acquisitions gained over a 10-year career in senior executive positions at Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson and Tibotec Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Pomerantz led the development and commercialization of ten FDA-approved infectious disease drugs in his career. Collectively, our management team has successfully developed 18 approved pharmaceutical drugs in infectious disease and other indications. Our management team has extensive experience in microbial ecology, microbiology and live biologicals, with over 25 years’ experience studying the microbiome and over 60 published papers on the science of the microbiome. Additionally, our team has extensive experience in building out commercial capabilities in specialty diseases and has a track record for success in the commercialization of vaccine products, which have analogous manufacturing processes to that of Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics.
 In January 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the License Agreement, with Nestec Ltd., or NHS, for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates in development for the treatment and management of CDI and IBD, including UC and Crohn’s disease. The License Agreement will support the development of our portfolio of products for CDI and IBD in markets outside of the United States and Canada, or the Licensed Territory, and is expected to provide substantial financial support for our ongoing worldwide research and development. We have retained full commercial rights to our entire portfolio of product candidates with respect to the United States and Canada, where we plan to build our own commercial organization. 
 Under the License Agreement, we granted to NHS an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize, in the Licensed Territory, certain products based on our microbiome technology that are being developed for the treatment of CDI and IBD, including SER-109, SER-262, SER-287 and SER-301, or, collectively, the NHS Collaboration Products. Upon mutual agreement, one or more other products based on our microbiome technology for CDI or IBD may be added to the License Agreement in lieu of or in addition to the then-existing NHS Collaboration Products. NHS’ exclusive license in the Licensed Territory to develop and commercialize NHS Collaboration Products extends to any indications for which the parties agree to develop such products. We also granted to NHS a non-exclusive license to export, develop and make NHS Collaboration Products in the licensed fields worldwide solely for commercialization in the licensed fields and in the Licensed Territory. Additionally, the rights to develop and commercialize a given Collaboration Product in certain non-EU countries within the Licensed Territory may revert to us if NHS either elects not to pursue commercialization of such Collaboration Product in such country, or fails to meet certain agreed upon milestones for commercialization of such Collaboration Product in such country. If the licensed rights in any country revert to us in this way, then we would pay to NHS a royalty in the mid-single digits on net sales of such Collaboration Product in such country.
 The License Agreement sets forth our and NHS’ respective obligations for development, commercialization, regulatory and manufacturing and supply activities for the NHS Collaboration Products with respect to the licensed fields and the Licensed Territory. Under the License Agreement, our and NHS’ development activities will be governed by global and regional development plans, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. We agreed to manufacture and supply NHS Collaboration Products to support development and commercialization of NHS Collaboration Products in the licensed fields and in the Licensed Territory. We also agreed to use diligent efforts to develop NHS Collaboration Products under a global development plan and to obtain approval for such NHS Collaboration Products in the European Union, or EU. 
 In exchange for the license, NHS made an upfront cash payment of $120 million in February 2016. NHS has also agreed to pay us tiered royalties, at percentages ranging from the high single digits to high teens, of net sales of NHS Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory. Additionally, NHS has agreed to pay us up to $660 million for the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and up to an aggregate of $1.125 billion for the achievement of certain commercial milestones related to the sales of NHS Collaboration Products. We received a $10 million milestone payment in 2016 associated with the initiation of our Phase 1b study for SER-262 in CDI.
 For the development of NHS Collaboration Products for IBD under a global development plan, we are obligated to pay the costs of clinical trials of such products up to and including Phase 2 clinical trials, and 67% of the costs for Phase 3 and other clinical trials of such products, with NHS bearing the remaining 33% of such costs. For other clinical development of NHS Collaboration Products for IBD, we will pay the costs of such activities to support approval in the United States and Canada, and NHS will bear the cost of such activities to support approval of NHS Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory. 
 7

With respect to development of NHS Collaboration Products for CDI under a global development plan, we agreed to pay all costs of Phase 2 clinical trials for SER-109 and of Phase 3 clinical trials for SER-109. We agreed to bear all costs of conducting any Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials under a global development plan for NHS Collaboration Products other than SER-109 for CDI. We agreed to pay 67% and NHS agreed to pay 33% of other costs of Phase 3 clinical trials conducted for NHS Collaboration Products other than SER-109 for CDI under a global development plan. For other clinical development of NHS Collaboration Products for CDI, we agreed to pay costs of such development activities to support approval in the United States and Canada, and NHS agreed to bear the cost of such activities to support approval of NHS Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory. 
 The License Agreement continues in effect until terminated by either us or NHS on the following bases: (i) NHS may terminate the License Agreement in the event of serious safety issues related to any of the NHS Collaboration Products; (ii) we may terminate the License Agreement if NHS challenges the validity or enforceability of any of our licensed patents; and (iii) either we or NHS may terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency. Upon termination of the License Agreement, all licenses granted to NHS by us will terminate, and all rights in and to the NHS Collaboration Products in the Licensed Territory will revert to us. If we commit a material breach of the License Agreement, NHS may elect not to terminate the License Agreement but instead apply specified adjustments to its payment obligations and other terms and conditions of the License Agreement. 
 The License Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, intellectual property protection provisions, certain indemnification rights in favor of each party and customary confidentiality provisions and limitations of liability.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leading biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing microbiome therapeutics to address significant unmet medical needs. The critical components of our strategy include:

• | Rapidly advancing the development of our lead product candidate, SER-109, for the prevention of further recurrences of CDI in patients with recurrent CDI. SER-109 has been granted both Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of CDI. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides for intensive guidance from the FDA in an effort to expedite the drug development process. In our randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical study, 44% of subjects (26 of 59) who received SER-109 experienced a recurrence at the 8 week endpoint compared to 53% of subjects (16 of 30) who received placebo, a result that was not statistically significant. Based on a detailed analysis of clinical, microbiome and CMC factors that may have contributed to the outcome of this study, as well as a comparison to our earlier Phase 1b/2 clinical study, we are involved in ongoing discussion with the FDA. Based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study in approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection. Study participants will be randomized 1:1 between SER-109 and placebo and will receive a dose that is approximately 10-fold higher than in the first Phase 2, administered over three consecutive days. The FDA has agreed that this new trial may qualify as a pivotal study with achievement of a persuasive clinical effect and addressing FDA requirements, including clinical and statistical factors, an adequately sized safety database, and certain CMC parameters.

• | Advancing the clinical development of SER-262 to be used following antibiotic treatment of primary CDI to prevent an initial recurrence of CDI. We are developing SER-262 as a therapeutic to be used following antibiotic treatment of primary CDI to prevent an initial recurrence of CDI. SER-262 contains bacteria that are a subset of the bacterial ecology comprising SER-109, however, SER-262 is not derived from human stool and, in contrast, is rationally designed based on in vitro and in vivo screening data and made in bacterial fermenters. Pre-clinical studies of SER-262 have demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model of CDI, similar to pre-clinical studies of SER-109. In July 2016, we initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation Phase 1b study. The study is expected to enroll up to 60 patients who have experienced a first episode of CDI. The primary endpoints of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-262 in subjects with primary CDI and compare the CDI recurrence rate between the SER-262 and placebo groups at up to 8 weeks after dosing. Top-line data from the SER-262 Phase 1b study is expected in the second half of 2017.

• | Continuing clinical development of SER-287 for the treatment of IBD, including ulcerative colitis. The clinical development of SER-287 to treat UC is supported by preclinical studies in multiple animal models of colitis that provide evidence that SER-287 administration results in reduced pathology. Published clinical reports furthermore suggest that modulation of the microbiome through repetitive fecal microbiota transplants may lead to meaningful clinical response in certain UC patients. In December 2015, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating SER‐287 in patients with mild‐to‐moderate UC. The randomized, placebo-controlled multiple dose Phase 1b study of SER-287 is expected to enroll up to 55 subjects with active mild-to-moderate UC who are failing current therapies. The primary endpoint of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-287 and the change in the microbiome composition and engraftment of SER-287 bacteria following SER-287 treatment. The study will also evaluate clinical response, complete remission, and endoscopic improvement, as well as metabolomic and immunological findings. Top-line data from the SER-287 Phase 1b study is expected in the second half of 2017.

• | Developing SER-301 for the treatment of IBD. We are designing and developing SER-301, a synthetic Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic candidate for the treatment of IBD. The design is being driven by insights from fecal microbiota transplants and will leverage information from SER-287, including changes to the microbiome in patients with UC, a form of IBD.

• | Developing SER-155 for the prevention of transplant-related mortality. We are designing and developing SER-155, a synthetic Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic candidate for the prevention of transplant-related mortality (due to infection and GvHD) in allo-HSCT recipients. The design is being driven by insights from our collaborators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center into the microbiome composition of patients following allo-HSCT.

• | Leveraging our leading microbiome therapeutics platform to develop additional innovative and novel Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics across a range of serious medical conditions with high unmet need including infectious disease, metabolic disease, inflammatory disease, rare genetic disease, and applications in immuno-oncology. We believe that the combination of experience, proprietary data and proprietary know-how related to the microbiome and of the production of microbial strains provides us a competitive advantage in the design and development of microbiome therapeutics. Our platform enables us to build upon our existing and growing clinical experience to rationally design treatments for acute and complex chronic diseases. We intend to leverage this advantage to develop additional innovative Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics.

• | Commercializing our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics, including SER-109, if approved, directly in the United States and Canada and with collaborators outside of North America. In January 2016, we entered into a strategic collaboration with NHS for microbiome-based CDI and IBD therapies in markets outside the United States and Canada. We have retained the worldwide rights for therapies developed outside of these indications. We believe the market for recurrent CDI is sufficiently concentrated to permit us to effectively commercialize SER-109 in the United States with a highly focused and specialized sales force of less than 100 individuals. To the extent we are able to commercialize SER-109 in the United States, we will leverage that experience to further build our direct sales force to address the larger patient population to be addressed by SER-262.

• | Developing manufacturing capabilities sufficient to support commercialization of any approved Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic candidates. Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic manufacturing will require capabilities that are distinct from other biologic drugs. We have made strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities to help ensure that we maintain control of our know-how and also because we believe these capabilities will be necessary and highly advantageous for the development of future Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics such as SER-109, SER-287, SER-262, SER-301 and SER-155. Our bioprocess and manufacturing personnel are focused on creating a platform of manufacturing expertise that will set the stage for further advances in the emerging field of microbiome therapeutics.

Understanding the Microbiome and Its Impact on Disease
 The human microbiome is one of the richest and most diverse ecosystems on earth with a population of approximately 40 trillion microorganisms that live in our intestines, mouth, skin and elsewhere in the body. These microbial ecologies have numerous beneficial functions necessary to supporting health, such as digesting food, preventing disease-causing bacteria from invading the body, regulating our immune system and synthesizing essential nutrients and vitamins. Among the various microbial ecologies in the human body, the colonic microbiome is one of the most diverse microbial communities with up to 100 billion to one trillion cells per milliliter. In a healthy, symbiotic state the colonic microbiome enables the body to function normally. However, the colonic microbiome can change in composition, such as in response to long-term or high-dose exposure to antibiotics or following a gastrointestinal infection. As a result, there can be a loss of key microbes that results in a state of dysbiosis. Dysbiosis of the microbiome is associated with a wide range of disease and infections.
 Although bacteria are often associated with infection and disease, much of the bacteria that colonize the human body are essential for life. Until recently, few scientific studies focused on the benefits of the bacteria comprising the microbiome. In 2005, the National Institutes of Health funded the Human Microbiome Project, or HMP, which had as one of its goals the characterization of the microbiome with enough specificity to enable the study of variations in the microbiome and their influence on disease.
 Historically, researchers studied microbes in patients by isolating pathogens and growing them in culture. This process typically identifies only a limited diversity of microbial species. The HMP used metagenomic sequencing technologies to analyze 5,000 samples, representing more than 3.5 terabases of genome sequence data, to identify specific genetic sequences found only in bacteria. HMP researchers estimate that 500 to 1,000 unique bacterial species occupy the human ecosystem, and these researchers believe they have characterized the normal range of microbial variation in the U.S. population. Importantly, HMP researchers have discovered that different consortia of microbes may accomplish the same metabolic activity, and the presence of those metabolic activities is more important than the exact species of microbe providing the function. Results from the HMP have provided a robust baseline microbiome against which disease states can be compared.
 9

Compared to the baseline data developed by the HMP, numerous scientific studies are emerging in both animals and humans, suggesting that many human diseases can be correlated with dysbiosis of the microbiome. These include infections, such as CDI or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, or VRE; metabolic disorders, such as early-stage, non-insulin dependent diabetes, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD/NASH; allergies; autoimmune disease; inflammatory diseases, such as UC, Crohn’s disease and pouchitis; and cancer, including immune-oncology related applications. Examples of some studies include:
  
• | A study published in PLOS Pathogens in 2012 suggested that a mixture of six different bacteria found naturally in the gastrointestinal system of mice, when isolated from stool and reintroduced into the infected mice, was effective at suppressing CDI (Lawley et al., PLOS Pathogens, 2012). Researchers in the study found that a single treatment of the bacteria was sufficient and that the suppression lasted for months.

• | A placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded clinical study published in Gastroenterology in 2015 showed that repetitive fecal microbiota transplant, or FMT, delivered via enema weekly for 6 weeks could induce clinical remissions in patients with active UC (Moayyedi et al., Gastroenterology, 2015). This study used an established measure of colonic mucosal healing to assess the efficacy of FMT compared to placebo, thus demonstrating the role of the microbiome in treating active UC. A subsequent randomized, placebo controlled, blinded study of FMT delivered 5 days per week for 8 weeks demonstrated similar clinical and endoscopic response rates (Paramsothy et al., Lancet, 2017).

• | Data from cancer patients undergoing allo-HSCT show the influence of the microbiome on patient survival. An observational study of allo-HSCT patients following allo-HSCT demonstrated that 3-year survival in patients with a low diversity microbiome was 36% whereas survival in patients with a medium to high diversity microbiome was ≥60%. Excess mortality in the low diversity subset was driven by deaths due to infection and GvHD, not the underlying cancer itself (Taur et al, Blood, 2014). A follow up from the same researchers looked at allo-HSCT patients receiving transplants who are at highest risk of GvHD and showed a greater than 5-fold increase in mortality was correlated with microbiome composition. (Jenq et al., Biol of Blood and Marrow Transplant, 2015).

• | A placebo-controlled, randomized, blinded clinical study published in Gastroenterology in 2012 showed that administration of FMT derived from lean donors to obese subjects with metabolic syndrome could transiently increase insulin sensitivity (Vrieze et al, Gastro, 2012). This study furthermore identified changes in the microbiome of the small intestine that might have caused the effect. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Two studies in mouse cancer models, both published in Science in 2015, demonstrated that the anti-tumor response to immunological checkpoint inhibitors could be enhanced by altering the microbiome (Velizou et al., Science 2015; Slvan et al., Science 2015). In addition, a prospective study in melanoma patients receiving anti-CTLA4 therapy for their cancer showed that a difference in the microbiome prior to treatment correlated with the subsequent development of colitis, a major side-effect of anti-CTLA4 treatment (Dubin et al., Nature, 2016). Most recently, researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center have reported that the diversity and content of the microbiome may determine the efficacy of treatment with checkpoint inhibitors (Gopalakrishnan, et al., 2017 ASCO-SITC Clinical Immuno-Oncology Symposium). Taken together, these results suggest that microbiome therapies might improve the safety and efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in immuno-oncology treatments.

• | A study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in 2015 demonstrated that the microbiome of mice could be engineered to treat hyperammonemia, a clinical consequence of a set of rare genetic diseases known as Urea Cycle Disorders (Shen et al., JCI, 2015). In this preclinical model, gut microbes that lack a functional urease gene were able to alter ammonia balance in the blood, suggesting a new route to novel therapeutics.

 There are currently no microbiome therapeutics approved by the FDA. We believe that the ability to develop drugs that are able to modulate the microbiome and return a dysbiotic microbiome to its healthy state presents a significant opportunity to improve human health.
 Our Microbiome Therapeutics Platform
 We are developing a new approach to restoring health in settings of microbiome dysbiosis by using our microbiome therapeutics platform to develop Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics. Our microbiome therapeutics platform is premised on the hypothesis that the proximal cause or significant contributor to multifactorial diseases is a dysbiosis of the colonic microbiome. We believe this represents a paradigm shift in approaching the way the underlying disease is defined and can be treated. Our microbiome therapeutics are a novel class of biological drugs designed to treat disease by restoring a dysbiotic microbiome to a state of health. They represent rationally defined ecological compositions, consisting of discrete combinations of beneficial microorganisms with designed functional properties that provide the ability to re-establish keystone features of a functional microbiome in settings of disease.
 10

Our microbiome therapeutics platform integrates genomic and related functional data sets, proprietary algorithms and computational analysis, an extensive library of screened and characterized human commensal bacteria, clinical and mechanistic insights into diseases of interest, and advanced manufacturing capability. This platform allows us to rationally design, test, optimize, formulate and manufacture Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics. Our microbiome therapeutics platform provides a framework that we believe can significantly reduce the time typically required to advance therapeutics to the clinic. 
 Clinical Trials and Cohort Studies
 Our discovery process begins with human data derived from clinical trials and cohort studies, which we use as a basis for designing our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics. This allows us to compare the colonic microbiome of healthy normal individuals to those in a dysbiotic state, revealing the ecological and functional signatures of microbiome differences that we target using our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics. Additionally, our experience with SER-109 and clinical data generated with collaborators serves as a critical dataset for humans, instructing us on how the introduction of certain keystone microbes can facilitate and augment the restoration of a dysbiotic colonic microbiome for other indications. Using these insights generated by our proprietary design, we test therapeutic lead candidates. By using our genomic data sets and our proprietary tools combined with our experience with SER-109, we integrate clinical results into bench research to design our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics.
Ecobiotic Candidate Design
 We have developed a candidate design program to assist us in identifying the keystone structural and functional elements of healthy microbiomes, the deficiencies present in disease states and the functional profile of a microbial ecological network that can return the microbiome to a healthy state. The following diagram depicts the steps in our candidate design program:

Our candidate design program applies computational comparative genomics and systems biology methods to analyze existing clinical data sets, such as those derived from SER-109 clinical studies and from studies with collaborators, to elucidate the structure and function of a healthy microbiome relative to a microbiome in a disease state. The structure is defined in terms of the organisms that comprise the ecology of the microbiome while the function is defined in terms of the genes and metabolic pathways inherent to the organisms that comprise that ecology. Structural and functional properties of a microbiome are determined using our proprietary algorithms that derive actual ecological networks that characterize the microbiome of subjects with a particular disease or that are in a state of health. Our algorithms define those organisms that impact the structure of the microbial communities and the health of the microbiome, which we refer to as keystone organisms, and their associated critical, functional biological pathways. Keystone organisms and their associated critical, functional biological pathways may exist in low, moderate, or high abundance in an ecology of microbes, but are often missing or at reduced levels in an individual with disease. By comparing the ecologies in healthy and disease states, we are able to identify the ecological deficiencies and missing keystone components that characterize the disease state and are the target of our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics.
 Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics are rationally designed to solve for the microbiome ecological deficiencies identified between disease and health states. Rational design involves the determination, prioritization and optimization of microbial network ecologies with the greatest therapeutic potential based on critical factors, such as the evolutionary relationships of the microbes, theoretical and empirically defined functional capabilities, safety profile of strains and various bioprocessing parameters. We maintain a proprietary design and discovery database that captures and integrates key information about microbial strains. Our design algorithms in combination with our functional screening capabilities enable us to identify lead candidate compositions that possess the necessary functional profile to restore the ecological deficiency that causes the dysbiosis.
 11

Strain Library Screening and Lead Optimization and Ecobiotic Candidate Nomination
 To facilitate the screening of network ecologies and individual strains, we have developed and maintain proprietary know-how on the isolation, cultivation and fermentation of microbial strains. Our proprietary library comprises over 14,000 strains isolated from healthy donors. Using information from our strain library, we develop and execute moderate- to high-throughput in vitro and ex vivo screens that evaluate the efficacy and functional properties of candidates and individual microbial strains that comprise the lead candidate ecologies. Once we have a lead candidate we optimize its efficacy and functional properties by screening variants in disease relevant models, including in vivo models on a reduced set of candidates that are relevant to the disease indications we are investigating. The final candidate that meets our predefined safety and efficacy criteria is nominated for clinical development.
Metabolomics
 In addition to genomic analysis, we integrate metabolomic methods to identify the small molecules made by the microbiome.  Integration of genomic and metabolomic data enable an understanding of which organisms are responsible for particular changes in the gut that may affect health and disease.  These functional data can be further studied in vitro and in animal models to assist in the design of novel microbiome drugs.
 Bioprocess and Formulation
 Our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics in development consist of combinations of bacteria and/or bacterial spores rather than single strains. As a result, we must be able to produce, purify and formulate multiple strains of bacteria economically and be able to test the composition of a combination product for quality control. Our bioprocess development and manufacturing processes are designed to address each of these elements.

• | Fermentation: We employ platform fermentation processes as starting conditions for current good manufacturing processes, or cGMP, production schemes and, when required, develop strain specific process parameters.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Purification: Similar to fermentation, we use small-scale purification operations to complete bench-scale manufacturing and quickly assess the final process yield, quality and robustness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Formulation: Our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics are combinations of bacteria and/or bacterial spores and can be administered orally to effect the primary goal of delivering viable bacteria or spores to the intended location in a condition where they are able to replicate and correct dysbiosis.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analytical: We address quality control requirements for our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics using proprietary microbiological and sequence-based testing schemes, including high-throughput quantitative analytics to assess the identity, potency and purity of the final product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-clinical and Clinical Testing
 One of the key competitive advantages of microbiome therapeutics is that we believe they will not need to undergo the same pre-clinical testing that other modalities such as small molecules require. Because the components of our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics are found naturally in the body, we do not expect to need carcinogenicity studies or studies designed to evaluate how our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics interact with other drugs. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies are performed to examine the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a drug under investigation typically in healthy volunteers. Because our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics are not absorbed and, therefore, remain in the colonic microbiome, we believe such trials will not be necessary and we expect to proceed directly to patients with the disease that we are studying. These pre-clinical and clinical studies are costly and time- consuming and the ability to proceed in development without them provides an advantage as compared to traditional drug development. For example, based on our correspondence with the FDA, further pre-clinical studies will not be needed for SER-109. We were also not required to perform traditional pre-clinical toxicology studies on SER-287, our investigational product for UC, or for SER-262, our Ecobiotic drug candidate for primary CDI. We believe many of the same requirements may apply across our future product candidates.
Our Product Pipeline
 We believe our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics represent a novel approach with potential application across a broad range of human diseases.  Our most advanced drug development program, SER-109, focuses on recurrent CDI. SER-109 has been designated as a Breakthrough Therapy and an Orphan Drug by the FDA. Based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study in approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection. Study participants will be randomized 1:1 between SER-109 and placebo and will receive a dose that is approximately 10-fold higher than in the first Phase 2, administered over three consecutive days. The FDA has agreed that this new trial may qualify as a pivotal study with achievement of a 
 12

persuasive clinical effect and addressing FDA requirements, including clinical and statistical factors, an adequately sized safety database, and certain CMC parameters. SER-262 is an Ecobiotic drug candidate under development for treatment of dysbiosis following primary CDI, in order to prevent recurrence, and is currently in a Phase 1b study in the United States. SER-287 is under development for the treatment of active mild-to-moderate UC and is also in a Phase 1b study in the United States. We expect to report top-line data for the Phase 1b studies of SER-262 and SER-287 in the second half of 2017. We are designing SER-301, a designed Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic candidate, for the treatment of  IBD, and SER-155, a designed Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic candidate, for the prevention of transplant-related mortality (due to infection and GvHD) following allo-HSCT. We are also researching potential Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic disorders, such as early-stage, non-insulin dependent diabetes non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), obesity and metabolic syndrome, and for enhancing the safety and efficacy of immuno-oncology agents including checkpoint inhibitors used in cancer treatment. Research in these indications is focused on developing Ecobiotic drugs that address specific functional defects in the microbiome, including the specific metabolic products made by the microbes.  We believe this approach may enable pursuit of a range of disorders including various forms of liver disease and rare genetic diseases of metabolism. 
 Our CDI Product Candidates
 SER-109 is a bacterial spore ecology consisting of an average of approximately 50 bacterial species derived from healthy donors’ fecal matter. SER-109 is designed to prevent further recurrences of CDI in patients suffering from recurrent CDI by restoring the dysbiotic microbiome to a state of health. In our open label Phase 1b/2 clinical study, results demonstrated that 87% of patients (26 of 30) met the predefined endpoint of preventing recurrent CDI within eight weeks following administration of SER-109.  97% of patients (29 of 30), achieved a clinical cure, which we defined as the absence of CDI requiring antibiotic treatment during the eight-week period after SER-109 dosing. SER-109, our lead product candidate, is designed to reduce the recurrences of CDI, a debilitating infection of the colon and, if approved by the FDA could be a first-in-field oral microbiome drug. A subsequent randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical study was conducted in 89 subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SER-109 in adults with recurrent CDI. In that study, 44% of subjects (26 of 59) who received SER-109 experienced a recurrence at the 8-week endpoint compared to 53% of subjects (16 of 30) who received placebo, a result that was not statically significant. SER-109 was generally safe and well-tolerated in both the Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies. The most common adverse events for SER-109 and placebo, respectively, were diarrhea (25% vs. 14%), abdominal pain (22% vs. 14%), flatulence (12% vs. 3%), and nausea (10% vs. 10%). No drug-related serious adverse events were observed. 
 In order to understand the difference in outcome between the Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies, we conducted an analysis of the available clinical, microbiome and CMC data. This root-cause investigation looked at the clinical trial population, study conduct, and diagnostic testing used for study inclusion and endpoint analysis, assessed clinical specimens for genomic and metabolomic biomarkers that might give insight into SER-109 efficacy and potency, reviewed manufacturing procedures and processes, performed retrospective analysis using high-resolution whole metagenomics sequencing of the Phase 1b/2 clinical study stool samples, and analytical methods that may have differed between Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies. We have now identified specific factors that we believe contributed to the Phase 2 clinical study results, including issues related to both the accurate diagnosis of C. difficile recurrent infection, and potential suboptimal dosing of certain subjects in the study. The SER-109 analyses were recently shared with the FDA, and we are actively discussing the design of a new clinical trial for SER-109.
 SER-109 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of recurrent CDI. Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs or biologics that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the drug candidate may be a substantial improvement over existing therapies. In addition, SER-109 has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of recurrent CDI. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
 We are also developing SER-262, a rationally designed ecology of spore forming bacteria, to be used following antibiotic treatment of primary CDI to prevent an initial recurrence of CDI. Pre-clinical studies of SER-262 have demonstrated efficacy similar to SER-109 in mouse models of CDI.  The Phase 1b study, a randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation study was initiated in July 2016. The study is expected to enroll up to 60 patients who have experienced a first episode of CDI. The primary endpoints of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-262 in subjects with primary CDI and to compare the CDI recurrence rate between the SER-262 and placebo groups up to 8 weeks after dosing. The subjects will be followed for 24 weeks after treatment.  If approved, we believe these two product candidates will enable us to provide an alternative and safer treatment for preventing the recurrence of CDI than the current standard of care.

Clostridium difficile Infection, or CDI
 C. difficile is a Gram-positive, toxin-producing, spore forming bacterium may cause debilitating diarrhea in infected individuals, but can also lead to more severe outcomes, such as inflammation of the colon (colitis), toxic megacolon and death. C. difficile bacteria express toxins that disrupt the structural architecture of cells causing leakage of fluids through the gastrointestinal epithelium. The cells disrupted by these toxins eventually undergo apoptosis and die, releasing their contents into the colon, resulting in inflammation of the colon, severe and persistent diarrhea and, in the most serious cases, death.
 CDI is most often associated with the prior use of antibiotics, although age and poor immune status are important risk factors as well. Antibiotics are thought to decrease resistance to CDI by causing dysbiosis in the microbiome. Since C. difficile spores are able to survive for long periods of time outside the body, and because healthcare settings are often sites of significant antibiotic use, CDI transmission rates in hospitals, long-term acute care facilities and nursing homes have been increasing. CDI is also a cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized cancer patients and bone marrow transplant patients as their immune systems are suppressed by cytotoxic drugs, which are drugs that inhibit or prevent the function of cells including cells of the immune system, and they may be heavily treated with antibiotics to prevent or treat infections. More recently, the rise of community-acquired CDI has been recognized as a growing problem.
 The CDC has identified C. difficile as one of the top three most urgent antibiotic-resistant bacterial threats in the United States. It is the most common cause of hospital acquired infection in the United States, having overtaken MRSA. CDI is responsible for the deaths of approximately 29,000 Americans each year. CDI is also costly to the healthcare system. According to a study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, the economic burden of CDI in 2008 in U.S. acute care facilities alone was estimated to be as much as $4.8 billion. In addition, a summary of studies published in 2009 in The Journal of Hospital Infection, calculated that the treatment cost per episode of primary CDI was as much as $5,000 and as much as $18,000 per recurrence of CDI (Ghantoji et al., 2010).  Further, according to a 2014 article in the American Journal of Infection Control, from 2001 to 2010, incidence of CDI per 1,000 patients discharged increased from 4.5 to 8.2 with an average hospital stay of eight days.  Research suggests that the risk of recurrence is approximately 25% after primary CDI, 40% after a first recurrence and greater than 60% for those experiencing two or more recurrences (Higa & Kelly, New Drugs and Strategies for Management of Clostridium difficile Colitis, J. of Intensive Care Medicine, 2013). Based on an epidemiological study conducted by the CDC, the incidence of C. difficile infection in the United States, based on a positive toxin or molecular assay in patients who did not have a positive result in the previous 8 weeks, was estimated to be 453,000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 397,100 to 508,500) (Lessa et. al., Burden of Clostridium difficile Infection in the United States, New England J. of Medicine, 2015).
 Current and developing treatment alternatives and their limitations
 Patients with CDI utilize antibiotics, FMT, and unapproved over-the-counter probiotics. Several therapeutic antibodies and vaccines are also being developed.
 Antibiotics.  According to the Infectious Disease Society of America, or IDSA, guidelines, the current standard of care for CDI is to treat with antibiotics, such as metronidazole or vancomycin. Metronidazole has been found to be effective for primary CDI, but approximately 29% of patients experience recurrence (Louie, et. al., Fidaxomicin versus Vancomycin for Clostridium difficile Infection, N. Engl. J. Med 364;5, February 3, 2011). Vancomycin is recommended for severe disease, but is more expensive. In addition, fidaxomicin, an approved antibiotic for CDI, may have higher initial efficacy compared to metronidazole, but it does not have a label claim to reduce or prevent CDI recurrence. No antibiotic therapeutics are currently approved for treatment of recurrent CDI.
 Recurrent CDI, defined as the presence of diarrhea and a positive C. difficile stool assay within two to eight weeks following the initial episode, is not well addressed by any of the available antibiotics. When a patient has recurred two or more times after the initial occurrence, CDI recurrence rates are greater than 60% and the probability of additional recurrences increases with successive cycles. Some physicians resort to pulse-taper regimens of vancomycin lasting six weeks or more, but there are no well-controlled clinical studies that show such regimens are effective. In extreme cases, patients are treated continuously for years with vancomycin, even while they continue to experience gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea and abdominal discomfort.
 The primary limitation of antibiotics is that their use appears to exacerbate dysbiosis, resulting in increased risk of future CDI. Recent research in animal models has shown that antibiotic use not only eliminates many healthy bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, but also leads to the release of nutrients that facilitate the growth of C. difficile. Antibiotics have also been shown to change the ratio of primary versus secondary bile acids in the colon by killing bacteria required to metabolize bile acids. This shift to a predominance of primary bile acids further facilitates the growth of C. difficile, as it requires primary bile acids for germination of its spores. As a result, antibiotic use may induce a lasting dysbiosis that makes it possible for C. difficile to colonize a person and then cause, or further perpetuate, disease.
 14

Fecal microbiota transplantation.  FMT, also known as a stool transplantation, is a procedure during which donated stool, including fecal microbes, is typically instilled via colonoscopy into a patient with CDI. We believe that the efficacy of FMT, which has resulted in cure rates for recurrent CDI of 81% in a randomized controlled study reported in 2013 in the New England Journal of Medicine, supports the role of dysbiosis as a cause of CDI recurrence. However, FMT presents several challenges for effective treatment of the disease. FMT has the potential to transmit infectious or allergenic agents between hosts, involves the transmission of potentially hundreds of unknown strains of bacteria, fungi and viruses from donor to subject, and is difficult to perform on a mass scale. Additionally, FMT is inherently non-standardized so that different desired and/or undesired material may be transmitted in any given donation. FMT is not approved by the FDA and we believe that, as currently practiced by clinical centers in the U.S., it may be unable to gain such approval since the product, to our knowledge, cannot be characterized according to current regulatory requirements for identity, potency, purity and safety and has not been tested in rigorous, placebo controlled, randomized and blinded clinical studies. Commercial providers of FMT must meet FDA regulatory requirements for a biologics license and must produce FMT material using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).
 Probiotic therapies.  Probiotics represent a group of products typically available over the counter in supplements and in some foods, which contain a small number of species of bacteria. However, to date there have been no clinical studies that have established the ability of probiotics to repair a dysbiosis of the microbiome. Further, there is neither a legally recognized definition of, nor a standard of identity for, the term probiotic in the United States or Europe. The European Food Safety Authority has rejected many of the claims of health benefits associated with probiotics because the microbes had not been sufficiently characterized, the claimed effect was not considered beneficial and human studies in support of the claims had not been made available. As a result, after December 14, 2012, food and nutritional supplements companies were no longer allowed to communicate health benefits for their products on account of probiotic content in the EU.
 Antibodies. Bezlotoxumab a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against C. difficile toxin B was approved in the United States in October, 2016 and in Europe in 2017 for the treatment of CDI. The antibody demonstrated 10% absolute risk reduction in preventing recurrence of CDI. Antibodies bind toxins to alleviate the symptoms of CDI, but they do not address the underlying dysbiosis of the microbiome, which we believe is the cause of recurrent CDI. Bezlotoxumab requires intravenous infusion. 
 Vaccines. The efficacy of vaccines in treating CDI in humans currently remains under investigation. In addition, it is difficult to define and access a target population for a CDI vaccine, given that the at-risk patient population is largely elderly individuals who typically respond less robustly to vaccination therapies.
 SER-109
 SER-109 is an ecology of bacteria in spore form enriched from fecal donations obtained from healthy screened donors. SER-109 consists of an average of approximately 50 bacterial species and is designed to reduce recurrences of CDI in patients suffering from recurrent CDI by restoring a dysbiotic microbiome to a state of health. In our open label Phase 1b/2 clinical study of SER-109, we evaluated the effect of treatment with SER-109 in patients with three or more occurrences of CDI in a 12-month period. Of the 30 patients enrolled in the trial, 87% of patients (26 of 30) met the predefined endpoint and 97% (29 of 30), achieved a clinical cure, which we defined as the absence of CDI requiring antibiotic treatment during the eight-week period after SER-109 dosing. A subsequent randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical study was conducted in 89 subjects to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SER-109 in adults with recurrent CDI.  In that study, 44% of subjects (26 out of 59) who received SER-109 experienced a recurrence at the 8-week endpoint compared to 53% of subjects (16 out of 30) who received placebo, a result that did not show a statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms.  SER-109 was generally safe and well tolerated in both the Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies. In each study we also performed an analysis of the microbiome using next-generation sequencing technology and microbiological analysis. These studies demonstrated a re-establishment of keystone organisms and a rapid increase in bacterial diversity, which enable the restoration of the microbiome to a healthy state.
 
SER-109 is formulated as oral capsules for administration after completion of antibiotics. Four capsules of SER-109 is comprised of about 30 million Colony-Forming Units that are delivered in four oral capsules. The spores in SER-109 are intended to germinate in the gastrointestinal tract and compete for the same nutrients required by C. difficile. 
 15

Phase 1b/2 clinical study design. The Phase 1b/2 clinical study was a two-part trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SER-109 in 30 patients with recurrent CDI, defined as three or more occurrences of CDI in the previous 12 months. Part 1 of the study evaluated a single dose of SER-109 administered orally in 30 capsules over two days, with the dose derived from approximately 75 grams of stool. Part 2 of the study evaluated a single dose of SER-109 administered orally in a range of one to 7 capsules over one day. The target dose in Part 2 was 1x108 spores per dose, which was approximately 17-fold lower than the mean dose in Part 1.
 
 
Cohort | Mean Dose (spore units) | Male/Female | Age Median (Range) | Number of CDI Recurrences in Prior 12 months Median (Range)
-------+-------------------------+-------------+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------
1 | 1.7x109 | 5 / 10 | 71 years (22 – 88) | 3 (2 – 6) 
2 | 1.0x108 | 5 / 10 | 58 years (39 – 83) | 3 (2 – 5) 

 
Phase 1b/2 clinical study results.  The primary efficacy measure was the absence of CDI (defined in this study as more than three unformed bowel movements in a 24-hour period with laboratory confirmation of a positive C. difficile stool test) during the eight weeks after initiating therapy. Twenty-six of 30 patients, or 87% of patients, in the Phase 1b/2 clinical study achieved the primary efficacy endpoint, consisting of 13 patients in each of Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. Among the 26 patients was one patient who experienced an initial recurrence on Day 26 and was re-treated, per protocol, with a dose from the same donor. Following re-treatment, this patient also achieved the primary efficacy endpoint. Of the patients who did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint, one had a recurrence of CDI on Day 5 and did not receive a second treatment with SER-109 and the three other patients were determined by their attending investigator to be recovering from their diarrheal episode by the time they submitted their stool sample for CDI testing. The three patients were determined to be clinically CDI free at eight weeks. As a result, the clinical cure rate for the study, which we defined as the absence of CDI requiring antibiotic treatment during the eight-week period after SER-109 dosing, was 97%, or 29 of 30 patients.
 The primary safety measures were an evaluation of adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs and physical examination findings prior to and after dosing with SER-109 over a 24-week time period. In Part 1 of the study, 80% of the patients experienced at least one adverse event, all of which were treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs. A TEAE was defined as an adverse event that started or worsened at or during the time of or after the date of the first dose of SER-109 through the final follow-up visit. Five, or 33%, of the patients were judged by the investigator to have a TEAE attributable to SER-109 and all were mild or moderate. In Part 2, 100% of the patients experienced at least one adverse event, all of which were TEAEs. Nine, or 60%, of the patients were judged by the investigator to have a TEAE attributable to SER-109 and all were mild or moderate. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders and diarrhea. The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity and consistent with post-antibiotic recovery from CDI. One patient in Part 2 had a severe adverse event of chest pain, which was not considered related to SER-109. Two patients each in Part 1 and Part 2 had more than one serious adverse event, none of which was considered related to SER-109. There were no deaths in Part 1 or Part 2.
 Phase 2 clinical study design. The Phase 2 clinical study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group two arm trial that enrolled a total of 89 patients with a history of multiply-recurrent CDI, defined as 3 or more CDI episodes within 9 months. The Phase 2 clinical study enrolled 89 subjects with multiply recurrent CDI, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week study conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SER-109. Subjects were randomized at a 2:1 ratio with 59 subjects receiving SER-109 and 30 subjects receiving placebo. SER-109 was administered orally as a single dose of 1x108 bacterial spores, following the completion of antibiotic treatment for CDI. The study was conducted at 36 centers across the United States. The primary endpoint was the absence of recurrence of C. difficile positive diarrhea requiring antibiotic treatment up to 8 weeks following treatment with SER-109 or placebo. 
 Phase 2 clinical study results. The predefined study primary efficacy endpoint was the relative risk of CDI recurrence up to 8 weeks after treatment with SER-109 compared to treatment with placebo.  CDI recurrence was defined as diarrhea for 2 or more consecutive days, a positive CDI test, and the requirement for antibiotic treatment. Based on 8-week data, CDI recurrence occurred in 44% of subjects (26 of 59) who received SER-109, compared to 53% of subjects (16 of 30) who received placebo. The relative risk of CDI recurrence for the placebo population compared to the SER-109 population was not statistically significant. As part of the prespecified design, subjects were stratified into two groups: less than 65 years old and 65 years old and older . In subjects less than 65 years old, CDI recurrence occurred in 43% of subjects who received SER-109 (12 of 28) and in 27% of subjects who received placebo (4 of 15). In subjects 65 years and older, CDI recurrence occurred in 45% of subjects who received SER-109 (14 of 31), and in 80% of those who received placebo (12 of 15). 
 The most commonly reported adverse events in both the SER-109 and placebo arms were in the gastrointestinal category, and were diarrhea (25% vs 14%), abdominal pain (22% vs 14%), flatulence (12% vs 3%), and nausea (10% vs 10%), for SER-109 and Placebo, respectively. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed. The SER-109 analyses were recently shared with the FDA. Based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study in approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection. Study participants will be randomized 1:1 between SER-109 and placebo and will receive a dose that is approximately 10-fold higher than in the first Phase 2, administered over 
 16

three consecutive days. Diagnosis of C. difficile infection for both study entry and for endpoint analysis will be confirmed by C. difficile cytotoxin assay, compared to the first Phase 2, where most patients were diagnosed by PCR. The new study will evaluate patients for 24 weeks and the primary endpoint will compare the C. difficile recurrence rate in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing. The FDA has agreed that this new trial may qualify as a pivotal study with achievement of a persuasive clinical effect and addressing FDA requirements, including clinical and statistical factors, an adequately sized safety database, and certain CMC parameters.
 Based on the eight-week data, we did not observe any difference in the adverse event frequency or type in the subjects receiving SER-109 compared to those receiving placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events in both the SER-109 and placebo arms were in the gastrointestinal category. The most common adverse events reported in the SER-109 arm were diarrhea, abdominal pain and flatulence. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed. 
 Analysis of Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical study results. 
 In our Phase 2 clinical study, the study’s primary endpoint of reducing the relative risk of CDI recurrence at up to 8 weeks after treatment was not achieved. In order to understand the difference in outcome between Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies, we conducted an analysis of the available clinical, microbiome and CMC data. This root-cause investigation looked at the clinical trial population, study conduct, and diagnostic testing used for study inclusion and endpoint analysis, assessed clinical specimens for genomic and metabolomic biomarkers that might give insight into SER-109 efficacy and potency, reviewed manufacturing procedures and processes, performed retrospective analysis using high-resolution whole metagenomics sequencing of Phase 1b/2 clinical study stool samples, and reviewed analytical methods, that may have differed between the Phase 1b/2 and Phase 2 clinical studies. We have now identified key factors that we believe contributed to the Phase 2 clinical study results, including issues related to both the accurate diagnosis of C. difficile recurrent infection, and potential suboptimal dosing of certain subjects in the trial. 
 The key factors include:
  
• | The diagnostic test for entry may not have differentiated subjects with active CDI disease from those with other disease but who had C. difficile carriage (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The diagnostic test for CDI recurrence during the study (the primary endpoint) overestimated recurrences, as PCR was the most common test performed
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The difference in recurrence rates by age in the placebo arm was confounded by the small number of placebo subjects (30) and the likely inclusion of subjects with irritable bowel syndrome rather than recurrent CDI, or RCDI
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The safety profile of SER-109, which includes diarrhea in the first week following dosing, led to SER-109 subjects presenting for evaluation of recurrence at a time when they were likely to be colonized with C. difficile leading to mistaken diagnosis of RCDI
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The dose and dosing regimen used in the study may not have been optimal in the Phase 2 clinical study based upon an assessment of the microbiome response, which was less robust then that observed in a retrospective analysis of the Phase 1b/2 clinical study subjects (a dose range of 700-fold).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We performed an analysis of the microbiome of our Phase 2 clinical study and a reanalysis of our Phase 1b/2 clinical study using whole metagenomics shotgun sequencing and microbiological analysis to evaluate long-term changes in the microbiome, including the restoration of bacterial diversity in the colon of patients. This demonstrated a rapid increase in bacterial diversity and a restructuring of the microbiome towards a healthy state. Upon introduction, SER-109 appears to engraft its bacterial species into the microbiome, with some of these species persisting in the patient’s gastrointestinal tract for at least 24 weeks after dosing. In addition, in some patients we noted the repopulation of organisms that were not in SER-109 and had not been detected in the patient prior to treatment. We believe this phenomenon, which we refer to as augmentation, is an important element for restoration of bacterial diversity and repair of dysbiosis. We did not observe any dose-dependent effect on engraftment, augmentation, or the clinical resolution of CDI in the Phase 1b/2 clinical study.
 The SER-109 analyses were recently shared with the FDA, and based on feedback received from the FDA, we plan to initiate a new Phase 2 SER-109 clinical study in approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection. Study participants will be randomized 1:1 between SER-109 and placebo and will receive a dose that is approximately 10-fold higher than in the first Phase 2, administered over three consecutive days. The FDA has agreed that this new trial may qualify as a pivotal study with achievement of a persuasive clinical effect and addressing FDA requirements, including clinical and statistical factors, an adequately sized safety database, and certain CMC parameters.
 Manufacturing.  SER-109 is a purified ecology of spores produced through a process of extraction from a natural human stool source, obtained from qualified, highly screened donors. The donor raw material is collected in a controlled setting, under a protocol that ensures that donors meet appropriate qualification criteria.
 17

Donors are required to be in good health, and to possess a medical history that minimizes the risk of exposure to and transmission of an infectious disease. Donors are tested for infectious agents and screened for gastrointestinal and other health factors. After initial qualification, the donor is eligible to donate for a defined period of time. Donors are monitored for health status changes during the donation period. At the end of the donation period, the qualification assessment is repeated to help ensure the donor has maintained their health status. After successful completion of an exit screening, donations are released for use in manufacturing.
 We initially process the donor material in our Cambridge manufacturing facility, and then transfer the process intermediate to a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, to isolate and concentrate SER-109 for finishing to the oral capsule dosage form. The purified drug substance is tested for identity, potency and purity, and subsequently formulated into drug product where it is again tested for identity, potency, purity, and pharmaceutical properties in our Cambridge facility. The final drug product dosage form is four hard capsules for oral administration. Steps are specifically built into the process to remove and kill non-spore microbes. We have conducted validation studies demonstrating the ability of the process to inactivate and clear hypothetical extraneous pathogens of concern, and we believe we have sufficient data from these studies to support ongoing and proposed clinical trials.
 Raw materials, intermediates, drug substance and drug product are tested using cGMP assays developed with our know-how to assess the key quality attributes of identity, potency and purity of the product.  Identity testing has been developed to assure the presence of specific live spore forms in the product. Potency assays assure the intended dose of spores, and assess stability of the spores during storage.  Stability of the dosage form is also confirmed. Proprietary microbiological purity assays have been developed to enable testing for microbial contaminants in the presence of the live spore product.
 We believe we can address market demand with a relatively small-scale manufacturing process. If approved, we anticipate that we will be able to produce a sufficient commercial supply of SER-109 to meet estimated demand in the United States using donations from a modest number of donors.
 SER-262
 We are developing SER-262, which is a synthetic fermented, multi-strain Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic intended to be used following antibiotic treatment of primary CDI to prevent an initial recurrence of CDI. We have designed SER-262 to increase and improve diversity in the colonic microbiome after antibiotics treatment of primary CDI. The results of our Phase 1b/2 clinical study of SER-109 provided multiple insights in designing the spore ecology used in SER-262, which consists of a subset of bacteria found in SER-109. Pre-clinical studies of SER-262 have demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of CDI similar to those observed in pre-clinical studies of SER-109.
 As part of our selection of SER-262 we screened multiple candidates for efficacy in animal models using SER-109 as a reference compound. SER-262 provided significant protection against CDI with reduced mortality, minimum weight loss and clinical score measures of efficacy. Strains in SER-262 have met initial bioprocess specifications for spore titer and yield, and each organism has been characterized by whole genome sequencing and a battery of in vitro tests and characterizations.  
 The result of testing in a pre-clinical mouse model of CDI are depicted in the diagrams below.
 

18

We filed an IND to initiate clinical trials with SER-262 in May 2016. The Phase 1b clinical study, a randomized, placebo controlled dose escalation study was initiated in July 2016. The study is expected to enroll up to 60 patients who have experienced a first episode of CDI. The primary endpoints of the study will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-262 in subjects with primary CDI and to compare the CDI recurrence rate between the SER-262 and placebo groups up to 8 weeks after treatment. Top-line data from the SER-262 Phase 1b clinical study is expected in the second half of 2017.
SER-262 represents the continued evolution of our platform and capabilities, validating our ability to extend our technology to new indications. SER-262, unlike SER-109, is made in bacterial fermenters and in a rational in vitro design similar to a fixed dose combination of small or large molecules. We intend to use this approach going forward for future Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics, which may eliminate the need for ongoing human donors in the CMC process. There are several advantages to using a synthetic approach to developing microbiome therapeutics. Synthetically derived product candidates can be manufactured in a reliable and reproducible manner, with extremely well-defined characteristics.  Based on our metagenomics expertise, proprietary in silico algorithms, extensive proprietary bacterial library, and advanced manufacturing capabilities, we believe we can design synthetically produced microbiome therapeutic candidates for specific target indications.  We believe , our capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage in developing synthetically produced microbiome therapies.
 Manufacturing. To manufacture SER-262, bacterial components for formulation are fermented and purified as spores. The bacteria originate from cell banks that have been manufactured starting from proprietary research strain banks. Research strain banks have been made by clonal isolation and multiple rounds of streaking for purity from stool originating from healthy, medically screened donors, followed by banking and testing for identity and purity. The strains are cultured in controlled fermentations to meet clinical study needs. cGMP material has been produced for the SER-262 Phase 1b clinical study. cGMP drug product processing is similar to SER-109 for initial proof-of-concept clinical trial materials, with the addition of a blending step to combine the individually fermented drug substances. Drug substance and drug product are tested for identity, purity, and potency, and the material is placed on stability studies to support clinical storage and use.  Optimization of the fermentation and purification processes, and the dosage form are ongoing to refine manufacturing processes for future studies and commercial needs.
 SER-287
 Recently published third-party research reported changes in the microbiome in a cohort of patients with IBD, including UC, compared to healthy individuals. The changes include higher levels of Enterobacteriaceae and lower levels of Clostridiales. The changes in these organisms are a form of dysbiosis, and we believe that if we can repopulate keystone organisms and functional pathways we could restore the microbiome thereby treating UC. UC is a serious chronic condition affecting approximately 700,000 individuals in the United States. The disease results in inflammation of the colon and rectum and can result in debilitating symptoms, including abdominal pain, bowel urgency and diarrhea.
 Based on this research and our experience with SER-109, we believe that we can use a complex spore ecology to restore the underlying dysbiosis of UC. SER-109 is comprised of organisms in the class of Clostridiales, which engraft after treatment with SER-109. SER-109 has also been shown to reduce the colonization of Enterobacteriaceae in CDI patients. 
 We initiated our Phase 1b clinical study in December 2015 and are enrolling subjects with mild-to-moderate UC to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SER-287 added to standard of care treatment. The primary endpoints of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-287, compare the change in the microbiome composition versus placebo and determine engraftment of SER-287 bacteria following SER-287 treatment. The study will also evaluate clinical response, complete remission, and endoscopic improvement, as well as metabolomic and immunological findings. Top-line data from the SER-287 Phase 1b clinical study is expected in the second half of 2017.
 Phase 1b clinical study design. 
 The broad objectives of the SER-287 Phase 1b clinical study are to determine the safety and tolerability of SER-287, and microbiome dynamics, in patients with active mild-to-moderate UC. 
 The Phase 1b clinical study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study utilizing weekly or daily dosing with SER-287. We plan to enroll eligible subjects at approximately 20 sites in the United States. The Phase 1b clinical study is designed to enroll adults 18 years of age and older who have mild-to-moderate UC as defined by a total modified Mayo score between 4 and 10, inclusive, with a modified Mayo endoscopic subscore ≥ 1.
 19

Patients will be randomized to one of four study arms: 
  
• | Pre-treatment with placebo for 6 days, followed by weekly dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pre-treatment with placebo for 6 days, followed by daily dosing with placebo for 8 weeks
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pre-treatment with vancomycin for 6 days, followed by daily dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pre-treatment with vancomycin for 6 days, followed by weekly dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER-287 compared to placebo; to compare the baseline composition of the intestinal microbiome to the composition at 8 weeks post-initiation of SER-287 or placebo; and to determine the engraftment of SER-287 bacteria into the intestinal microbial community in each of the SER-287 arms compared to the placebo arm.
 The secondary objectives of the study are to determine the proportion of subjects in each of the treatment arms who at eight weeks post-initiation of treatment achieve a clinical response, complete remission, and endoscopic improvement; to assess changes in serum and fecal biomarkers from baseline throughout treatment; to determine the complement of metabolic pathways; and to compare the changes in exploratory biomarkers from mucosal biopsies and stool in each of the treatment arms from baseline through eight weeks.
 This study will provide a safety profile of SER-287 compared to placebo for the UC population, describe the changes in the microbiome as a result of treatment with SER-287 and provide potential predictive biomarkers for future studies. UC is characterized by a decrease in microbial diversity and richness, with a lower prevalence of spore-forming organisms within the phylum Firmicutes. Preliminary data using FMT suggest that microbial interventions can affect clinical outcomes in UC, and this study will evaluate whether the ecology of bacterial spores in SER-287 can correct the dysbiosis in UC, increase microbial diversity and safely lead to a clinical response in UC patients with mild-to-moderate disease.
 SER-301
 We are designing and developing SER-301, a synthetic Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic candidate for the treatment of IBD.  The design is being driven by insights from successful fecal microbiota transplants for UC conducted by our academic collaborators and will leverage microbiome and metabolomic data gained from the ongoing Phase 1b study of SER-287.  The SER-301 program also benefits from what we have and will learn about synthetic Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic development in our SER-262 program.
 SER-155
 We have an active pre-clinical program to discover and develop Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics for other infectious diseases. The Phase 1b/2 clinical study of SER-109 provided initial evidence suggesting that Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics have the potential to eliminate colonization by potential microbial pathogens, such as VRE and Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella, Morganella and Proteus.  These may be present at low levels in the healthy colon, and like C. difficile, can overgrow after antibiotic use. Enterobacteriaceae can include multidrug resistant organisms, or MDROs, that represent significant public health concerns. For example, carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, is a significant problem in the United States and has been identified as an urgent priority by the CDC. VRE, CRE and other MDROs colonize the gastrointestinal tract after antibiotic use and can spread through contact with patients and healthcare workers both in institutional and in community settings.
 We are currently designing and developing SER-155, an Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic that may have activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative enteric bacterial pathogens. We expect to develop SER-155 for the prevention of transplant-related mortality in allo-HSCT recipients due to GvHD and infection.  The selection of the patient population will be based on pre-clinical data, and the assessment of our clinical development plan, regulatory path and market opportunities. We plan to conduct studies in animal models as well as conduct further in vitro characterization of individual strains, in order to define and nominate a composition for clinical development.

Research and Development
 A significant portion of our operating expenses consists of research and development activities related to SER-109, SER-262, SER-287, SER-155, SER-301 and the development of new Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our research and development expense was $83.2 million, $38.1 million, and $10.7 million, respectively. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition─Operating Expenses─Research and Development Expenses” for more information.  
 Sales and Marketing
 In January 2016, we hired Wael Hashad as Chief Commercial Officer and Executive Vice President. Mr. Hashad is responsible for all activities related to the anticipated commercialization of our products in development. If SER-109 is approved in the United States, we plan to commercialize it with our own focused specialty sales force. We believe we can effectively commercialize SER-109 with a commercial team of 100 or fewer sales representatives that will target gastrointestinal and infectious disease physicians, which are the two primary groups of physicians who treat multiply recurrent CDI patients.
 In January 2016, we entered into an agreement with NHS for the development and commercialization outside of the United States and Canada of our product candidates in development for CDI and IBD, including UC and Crohn’s disease. The agreement will support the development of our portfolio of products for CDI and IBD in markets outside of the United States and Canada and provide financial support for our ongoing research and development.
 Manufacturing
 The production of live bacterial products is highly specialized. Owing to their hardiness and environmental persistence, production of spore-forming organisms poses unique considerations for product, personnel, and facility protection. Manufacturing activities with spores are subject to specialized regulations. We expect that a typical commercial fermentation will yield on the order of hundreds or thousands of doses per liter depending on the product and its composition. Additionally, because a given total dose is split between several strains, the per-strain requirements for production may be even lower. As a result, we believe the high productivity relative to the dose level will enable production scales for both clinical and commercial supply to be modest.
 We have developed supply chains for producing and testing materials to ensure the availability of future clinical trial supplies. Our development processes are designed to ensure that the raw materials, process technologies and analytical tests we use are scalable and transferable to a cGMP manufacturing environment. These include the following core elements:
  
• | Fermentation. We are using microscale screening to optimize culture of the bacterial strains of interest in our current and foreseeable product candidates. These screens can identify the fermentation platform that is best-suited for optimization and scale- up of the strains. Small-scale fermentation systems (0.1 L to 50 L) enable the optimization of a wide variety of culture conditions and have been demonstrated to be scalable to larger fermentation processes and enable technology transfer to clinical and final manufacturing sites. We employ platform fermentation processes as starting points for cGMP production processes, and develop strain specific processes as required. To develop master cell banks, working cell banks, and bulk drug substance for commercial product, we are using bacterial strains originating from a unique research cell bank precursor, so we expect the research cell banks and final drug product should be genetically and physiologically similar.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Purification. Similar to fermentation, we believe small-scale purification operations are available for assessing large-scale cGMP manufacturing of live cells, and to quickly assess downstream process yield, quality and robustness. For our oral products, purification is typically less complex than for parenteral biologics such as monoclonal antibodies that must purify away very similar components from the culturing process. Separation of viable microbes from soluble fermentation broth components is typically much simpler. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Formulation. Our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics are combinations of live bacteria and can be administered by a number of methods and by different routes. The primary goal in developing a formulation is to deliver live bacteria to the intended location in a condition where they are able to replicate and correct dysbiosis. Formulation development generally uses approved excipients and preservatives, and will include screening of liquid, solid, and suspension formulations to maximize the opportunity for extended stability with minimal cold-chain requirements. Dosage forms for oral products may be capsules, tablets, sachets, or liquid containers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21

 
• | Analytical. We are addressing quality control requirements for our Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics using proprietary microbiological, chemical, biochemical, and molecular sequence-based testing schemes. We have available and are further developing quality control and in-process analytical tools that can quantitatively measure the composition of spore, vegetative microbe and spore/vegetative combinations, which we believe enable a wide variety of drug products to be manufactured. Throughout the bioprocess and formulation development platform we use and will expand on high- throughput quantitative analytics to assess the identity, potency and purity of the final product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We currently have two manufacturing facilities internal to Seres; a small-scale 7,000 ft2 unit at our Kendall Square location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where we conduct cGMP manufacture of Ecobiotic therapeutic candidates to support drug substance and drug product for early phase and small-scale clinical supplies, and a larger 10,000 ft2 cGMP manufacturing facility at our headquarters, with the ability to perform both drug substance and drug product manufacturing for early and late-phase clinical development and at larger scales of operation. We may establish further manufacturing facilities that will serve late-phase clinical and commercial supply for our product candidates. We may do this by expanding our current and planned facilities, or by purchasing or building additional facilities.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that is important to our business, including seeking and, if granted, maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also utilize regulatory exclusivity as well as trade secrets to protect aspects of our business.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of treatment, methods of manufacture and methods for patient selection created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce any patents that we may obtain, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position and, in the future, may rely on or leverage in-licensing opportunities. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent may be challenged in courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or at all, whether the claims of any patent applications, should they issue, will cover our product candidates, or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors or otherwise provide any competitive advantage.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries and patent application filings, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Accordingly, we may not have been the first to invent the subject matter disclosed in some of our patent applications or the first to file patent applications covering such subject matter, and we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention.
 Our patent portfolio includes patent applications in the early stages of prosecution and seven issued U.S. patents. For our pending Patent Cooperation, or PCT, applications, we anticipate determining, in advance of the applicable deadlines, whether to pursue these applications and if so will pursue them in the United States and selected ex-U.S. jurisdictions. We believe that issued claims will provide protection for SER-109, SER-262, SER-287 and SER-155.
 22

Our patent estate leverages both offensive and defensive strategies. As of March 8, 2017, we owned a total of sixteen patent application families that include Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications and/or U.S. patent applications and ex-US patent applications. Some of these families are briefly described below. Five of the patent application families that include only U.S. provisional applications that will not themselves be examined and for which the deadline to file PCT applications and/or U.S. non-provisional applications have not yet expired. Issued patents and pending patent applications as of March 8, 2017 in six of the patent application families in our portfolio are described briefly below. We expect to pursue additional applications in these families over time.
  
• | A family related to binary combinations of microbes that includes the following issued and pending applications: (i) an issued U.S. patent, which claims therapeutic compositions that include selected binary combinations of microbes; (ii) two issued U.S. patents, which claim methods of using such compositions to treat or prevent CDI; (iii) a continuation U.S. patent application and (iv) national stage applications based on the PCT application in 14 ex-U.S. jurisdictions. Patents issuing from or based on these applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2033, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment. We expect this patent application family to provide patent protection for SER-109, SER-262, SER-287 and SER-155.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A family related to combinations of bacterial spores that includes the following issued and pending applications: (i) three issued U.S. patents that claim certain methods of treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, including Crohn’s disease and colitis, using combinations of bacterial spores and (ii) one issued U.S. patent that claims compositions and a pending continuation application and (iii) national stage applications based on the PCT application in 12 ex-U.S. jurisdictions claiming similar methods, as well as related compositions. Patents issuing from or based on these applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2034, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment. We expect this patent application family to provide patent protection for SER-109, SER-262, SER-287 and SER-155.

• | A family that includes a pending U.S. and a European national stage application based on a PCT application related to compositions of matter and methods for new combinations of microbes for treating gastrointestinal diseases. Patents based on these applications, if granted, are expected to expire in 2034, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A family that includes pending national stage applications in the U.S. and Europe, related to quality control of Ecobiotic products and characterization methods. Patents based on these applications, if granted, are expected to expire in 2034, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A family that includes pending national stage applications in the U.S. and six ex-U.S. jurisdictions, related to methods of restructuring of a host microbiome using microbial populations identified using our network-based discovery platforms. Patents based on these applications, if granted, are expected to expire in 2034, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid, and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A family that includes pending national stage applications in the U.S. and ten ex-U.S. jurisdictions related to compositions of matter and methods of treating disorders with compositions that include, for example, ternary combinations of microbes. Patents based on this application, if granted, are expected to expire in 2034, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment.

 Patent term
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional, patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
 The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of such an FDA-approved drug, an FDA- approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or fourteen years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug, and a patent cannot be extended more than once or for more than a single product. During the period of extension, if granted, the scope of exclusivity is limited to the approved product for approved uses. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply, if appropriate, for patent term extension on patents covering those product candidates, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture.

Trade secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically utilize trade secrets to protect aspects of our business. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities’ relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
 Competition
 The development and commercialization of new drug and biologic products is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. We are aware of a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as smaller, early-stage companies, that are pursuing the development of products, including microbiome therapeutics, for the prevention of CDI, IBD and other disease indications we are targeting. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are similar to our approach, and others may be based on entirely different approaches. For example, FMT is a procedure that is currently used for recurrent CDI and has resulted in high cure rates for recurrent CDI and our competitors and physicians may continue to seek to standardize and implement this procedure. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.
 These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing sales and marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of SER-109, SER-287, SER-262, SER-301 and SER-155 and any other product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market, especially for any competitor developing a microbiome therapeutic which will likely share our same regulatory approval requirements. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of lower cost products.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various pre-clinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval for our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 24

In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. None of our product candidates has been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States, and we currently have no BLAs pending. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during product development, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The process required by the FDA before our biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication, conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials
 Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which must be conducted in accordance with GLP requirements. The results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each investigator site proposing to participate in a clinical trial must also review and approve the clinical trial before it can begin at that site, and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including requirements for informed consent.
 For purposes of BLA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1 — Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25

 
• | Phase 2 — Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 — Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 Although most clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA, under the IND regulations and procedures described above, there are certain circumstances under which clinical trials can be conducted without submission of an IND. For example, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. Similarly, the FDA may exercise enforcement discretion to permit sponsors to conduct certain types of clinical investigations without an IND. Pursuant to the FDA guidance document “Enforcement Policy Regarding Investigational New Drug Requirements for Use of Fecal Microbiota for Transplantation to Treat Clostridium difficile Infection Not Responsive to Standard Therapies” (July 2013), the FDA announced its intention to exercise enforcement discretion and not apply the IND requirements for the use of FMT to treat CDI not responsive to standard therapies, provided that the treating physician obtains adequate informed consent from the patient or his or her legally authorized representative for the use of FMT products. In March 2014, the FDA issued a draft guidance document to clarify its Enforcement Policy in the July 2013 guidance.  In the March 2014 draft guidance, the FDA noted that since the issuance of its Enforcement Policy in July 2013, it has continued to review its policies in this area and it intends to continue to exercise enforcement discretion in more narrow circumstances than previously identified.  Specifically, the March 2014 draft guidance indicated the FDA’s intent to limit enforcement discretion in circumstances where the licensed health care professional treating the patient obtains adequate informed consent from the patient or his or her legally authorized representative for the use of FMT products; the FMT product is obtained from a donor known to either the patient or the licensed health care provider; and the stool donor and stool are qualified by screening and testing performed under the discretion of the licensed health care provider for the purposes of providing the FMT product.  Following receipt of public comments on the March 2014 draft guidance proposing to modify the July 2013 Enforcement Policy, the FDA issued a new draft guidance in March 2016 announcing its intention to further modify its approach to enforcement discretion for INDs for the use of FMT products.  In this draft guidance, the FDA indicated that it intends to continue to exercise enforcement discretion, provided that the licensed health care professional treating the patient obtains adequate informed consent for use of the FMT product; the FMT product is not obtained from a stool bank; and the stool donor and stool are qualified by screening and testing performed under the direction of the licensed health care provider for purposes of providing the FMT product to treat his or her patient.   The FDA further clarified in the March 2016 that, when finalized, the policy would supersede the final Enforcement Policy espoused in the July 2013 Guidance.  However, to date, the FDA has not finalized the March 2014 draft guidance.  The FDA provided confirmation to us that it intended to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to our Phase 1b/2 clinical study of SER-109, and accordingly, we did not conduct this trial under an IND. However, we have conducted and will continue to conduct all subsequent clinical studies of SER-109 under an IND. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the biologic in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Submission and FDA Review
 The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the biologic, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee unless a waiver is granted. However, an orphan-designated product, such as our SER-109, is not subject to an application user fee unless the human drug application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. Each BLA submitted to the FDA is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days of the FDA’s receipt of the application. If the BLA is found to be complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission.
 26

Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to review the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of reviewing BLAs within ten months of the 60-day filing date for standard review or six months for priority review, but the overall timeframe is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the biological product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility or facilities in which it is manufactured meet standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance with GCP requirements, and will not approve the biologic unless compliance with such requirements is satisfactory.
 The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional pre-clinical or clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than sponsors. Once the FDA approves a BLA, such approval defines the indicated uses for which the biologic may be marketed. The FDA may also require implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which can include a medication guide, communication plan, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, physician training, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling claims or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 The biologic testing and approval processes encompasses significant risk, and requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our product candidates for the treatment of a disease or condition, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Pre-clinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of our products. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life- threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 A new drug or biologic is eligible for fast track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor meetings with the FDA during pre-clinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. In addition, a new drug or biologic may be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
 27

Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. The FDA aims to review applications for new products designated for priority review within six months, compared to ten months under standard review. Additionally, products are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of all promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval, which could adversely impact the timing of commercial launch of the product.
 Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or review process. We have received Breakthrough Therapy designation for SER-109, and we may apply for one or more of the FDA’s expedited programs for our other product candidates. The FDA may disagree that our product candidates satisfy the criteria for such programs, such programs may fail to result in expedited development or review timelines, or the FDA may ultimately refuse to approve our product candidates despite their inclusion in any expedited programs. In addition, if the Breakthrough Therapy designation for SER-109 is no longer supported by subsequent data, FDA may rescind the designation.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Approved biologics that are manufactured or distributed in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications.
 Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our contract manufactures pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that product.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 28

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 Biosimilars and Regulatory Exclusivity
 We believe that any of our product candidates approved under a BLA should qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity against biosimilar competition currently permitted by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA. Specifically, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act, the BPCIA established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway provides legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics based on their similarity to an existing brand product, referred to as a reference product, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable with a brand product. Under the BPCIA the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological drug products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. The BPCIA is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning is subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes that operate to limit the scope or length of exclusivity afforded by the BPCIA could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products. In addition, the period of exclusivity provided by the BPCIA only operates against third parties seeking approval via the abbreviated pathway, but would not prevent third parties from pursuing approval via the traditional approval pathway. In addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products. For example, biological products in the EU may be eligible for at least a ten-year period of exclusivity.
Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. Further, if a designated orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan designation, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.
 In August 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to SER-109 for the treatment of recurrent CDI.
 We may seek orphan designation for one or more of our product candidates, but the FDA may disagree with our analysis of the prevalence of a disease or condition or other criteria for designation and refuse to grant orphan status. We cannot guarantee that we will obtain designation or approval for any product candidate, or that we will be able to secure orphan product exclusivity if we do obtain approval.
 29

Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. 
 For instance, in the EEA (comprised of the 28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
 Centralized procedure—Under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or, CHMP, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops. 
 National authorization procedures—There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
  
• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EEA a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.  Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten year orphan market exclusivity period, no marketing authorization application shall be accepted and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies.  The ten year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.

Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the biotechnology industry, which include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment and pricing transparency and data privacy and security laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts and free or reduced price items and services. The government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act (discussed below). Many states have similar laws that apply to their state healthcare programs as well as private payors.
 The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the False Claims Act, or FCA, impose liability on persons who, among other things, knowingly present or cause to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly make, use, or cause to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly make a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi–billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act on certain drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technologyfor Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.

To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit, or hinder, coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products, as well as provide rebates and discounts which may impact the net selling price of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of pharmaceutical and biological products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. Conducting such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. Recent budgetary pressures in many countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system. It is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payors for medical goods and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect medical or healthcare reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for pharmaceutical and biological products under government health care programs. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act:
  
• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of ‘‘average manufacturer price,’’ or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service utilization, to Medicaid managed care utilization, and created an alternate rebate formula for new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program that mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers and other qualifying providers. With the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, because 340B pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discounts to increase; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future, particularly in light of the new Presidential administration and U.S. Congress. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biological products. Adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, including our product candidates if approved.
