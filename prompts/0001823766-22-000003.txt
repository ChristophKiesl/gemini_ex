ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Archaea Energy Inc. (“Archaea” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation (formerly named Rice Acquisition Corp.) initially formed in September 2020, is one of the largest RNG producers in the U.S., with an industry-leading RNG platform primarily focused on capturing and converting waste emissions from landfills and anaerobic digesters into low-carbon RNG and electricity. We own, through wholly-owned entities or joint ventures, a diversified portfolio of 29 LFG recovery and processing facilities across 18 states, including 11 operated facilities that produce pipeline-quality RNG and 18 LFG to renewable electricity production facilities, including one non-operated facility and one facility that is not operational, as of December 31, 2021.
We produce and sell RNG and renewable electricity, primarily under long-term off-take agreements, along with the Environmental Attributes that we are able to derive from these products. RNG has the same chemical composition as traditional natural gas from fossil sources, and the RNG we produce and sell is pipeline quality and can be used interchangeably with natural gas in any application. Additionally, RNG and renewable electricity generate valuable Environmental Attributes that can be monetized under foreign, federal, and state initiatives. The Environmental Attributes we are able to derive and sell include RINs and state low-carbon fuel credits, which are generated from the conversion of biogas to RNG which is used as a transportation fuel; RTCs generated from the conversion of biogas to any thermal application (including power generation, heating or otherwise); and RECs generated from the conversion of biogas to renewable electricity.
We have entered into long-term agreements with biogas site hosts which give us the rights to utilize gas produced at their sites and to construct and operate facilities on their sites to produce RNG and renewable electricity. Payments to biogas site hosts under these agreements are typically in the form of royalties based on realized revenues, or, in some select cases, based on production volumes, and may also include upfront payments and advance royalty payments. We have long-term agreements in place which grant us gas rights for our full development backlog of 35 projects as of December 31, 2021. Our development backlog includes planned upgrades of certain operating RNG facilities over time, opportunities to convert most of our renewable electricity facilities into RNG facilities, and greenfield RNG development opportunities. 
We are planning to procure additional RNG development opportunities by securing gas rights agreements for additional landfill sites, and we may explore development of other biogas sources. We are also pursuing carbon capture and sequestration opportunities, including the development of wells for carbon sequestration, and we are pursuing the use of on-site solar-generated electricity to meet energy needs for RNG production, lower the carbon intensity of future biogas projects and reduce the carbon footprint of our partners, including our biogas host and commercial customers. Lowering the carbon intensity of our RNG is a key initiative that can enhance the value of our Environmental Attributes in certain markets. In addition to our carbon capture and sequestration and solar initiatives, we are pursuing the development and production of renewable hydrogen utilizing our landfill gas sources, which we would intend to sell under long-term fixed-price agreements into the emerging hydrogen economy.
We also provide other landfill energy operations and maintenance (“O&M”) services to certain of our JV production facilities and biogas site partners and sell gas processing equipment through our GCES subsidiary.
The Business Combinations and Related Transactions
On April 7, 2021, RAC entered into the Business Combination Agreements. On September 15, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), RAC completed the Business Combinations to acquire Legacy Archaea and Aria. Following the closing of the Business Combinations, RAC changed its name from “Rice Acquisition Corp.” to “Archaea Energy Inc.,” also referred to herein as the “Company.” Rice Acquisitions Holdings LLC was renamed “LFG Acquisition Holdings LLC,” also referred to herein as “Opco.” In connection with the Business Combinations closing, the Company completed a private placement of 29,166,667 shares of Class A Common Stock and 250,000 warrants (each warrant exercisable for one share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50) for gross proceeds of $300 million. 
The Company and Opco issued 33.4 million Class A Opco Units and 33.4 million shares of Class B Common Stock at the Closing Date to Legacy Archaea Holders to acquire Legacy Archaea. Aria was acquired for total initial consideration of $863.1 million, subject to certain future adjustments set forth in the Aria Merger Agreement (the “Aria Closing Merger Consideration”). The Aria Closing Merger Consideration consisted of cash consideration of $377.1 million paid to Aria 
Table of Contents

Holders, equity consideration in the form of 23.0 million newly issued Class A Opco Units and 23.0 million newly issued shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and $91.1 million for repayment of Aria debt. 
Archaea has retained its “up-C” structure, whereby all of the equity interests in Aria and Legacy Archaea are indirectly held by Opco and the Company’s only assets are its equity interests in Opco. 
The up-C structure allows the Legacy Archaea Holders, the Aria Holders and the Sponsor to retain their equity ownership through Opco, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of Class A Opco Units, and provides potential future tax benefits for Archaea when those holders of Class A Opco Units ultimately exchange their Class A Opco Units and shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock in the Company. Opco is considered a VIE for accounting purposes, and the Company, as the sole managing member of Opco, is considered the primary beneficiary. As such, the Company consolidates Opco, and the unitholders that hold economic interests directly in Opco are presented as redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s financial statements.
Holders of Class A Opco Units, other than Archaea, have the right (a “redemption right”), subject to certain limitations, to redeem Class A Opco Units and a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock for, at Opco’s option, (i) shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, or (ii) a corresponding amount of cash. The Aria Holders were subject to a 180-day lock-up period on transferring their Class A Opco Units which expired early in November 2021 due to Class A Common Stock trading prices as set forth in the Stockholders Agreement. The Legacy Archaea Holders are subject to a lock-up period ranging from one to two years following the Closing. Additional details and discussion of the lock-up period are provided in “Note 4 - Business Combinations and Reverse Recapitalization” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Principal Products and Services
RNG Production and Power Generation
We produce RNG by operating 11 RNG facilities through wholly-owned entities or operating joint ventures, and we produce Power by operating 16 LFG to renewable electricity facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Legacy Archaea and Aria produced and sold, on an aggregate basis including our proportionate share from our equity method investments, 5.72 million MMBtu of RNG and 872 thousand MWh of electricity (including approximately 203 thousand MWh from LES Project Holdings LLC assets that were sold by Aria in June 2021).
Generation of Environmental Attributes
We generate Environmental Attributes including RINs, LCFS credits, and RTCs in the RNG market and RECs in the power market.
Commercial Activities – Monetizing our RNG, Power and Environmental Attributes
Our differentiated commercial strategy is focused on selling the majority of our RNG volumes under long-term, fixed-price contracts with creditworthy partners including utilities, corporations, and universities, which helps these entities reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve decarbonization goals while utilizing their existing gas infrastructure. Whenever possible, we seek to mitigate our exposure to commodity and Environmental Attribute pricing volatility by selling our RNG and Environmental Attributes under long-term contracts which are designed to provide revenue certainty. As of March 15, 2022, we have $5.2 billion in cumulative fixed-price value under our existing long-term, fixed-price contracts, based on maximum annual volumes over the term of the contracts (weighted average contract term is 18.7 years). All of these contracts are with investment grade counterparties, except for one counterparty, which does not have a credit rating, to a contract constituting less than 1% of our total cumulative fixed-price value as of March 15, 2022.
We enter into bundled contracts, where RNG and Environmental Attributes are sold together, and at times, enter into agreements to sell Environmental Attributes on their own. Many of our agreements have minimum sales volumes, and some also allow us the optionality to sell additional volumes up to a maximum amount under the contract. We also sell a portion of our volumes under short-term agreements, and many of these volumes generate Environmental Attributes that we also monetize.
Table of Contents

In November 2021, the Company entered into a 21-year, fixed-price RNG purchase and sale agreement with Northwest Natural Gas Company, a subsidiary of NW Natural Holdings, for the sale of Environmental Attributes related to up to one million MMBtu of RNG annually, beginning in 2022 and ramping up to the full annual quantity in 2025.
In January 2022, the Company entered into a 20-year, fixed-price RNG purchase and sale agreement with FortisBC Energy Inc., a subsidiary of Fortis Inc., for the sale of up to approximately 7.6 million MMBtu of RNG and associated Environmental Attributes annually, with sales expected to begin in 2022 and ramping up to the full annual quantity in 2025.
In February 2022 and through March 15, 2022, we entered into fixed-price agreements to forward sell 15.9 million of our RINs expected to be generated in 2022 to provide price certainty over the short-term.
These recent commercial wins have moved us closer to our target of selling 70% of our expected production under long-term, fixed-price agreements with creditworthy counterparties. As of March 15, 2022, 7 MMBtu of RNG is contracted for 2022 based on maximum volumes under our existing long-term contracts. Once volumes under these contracts ramp up to full contractual levels in the mid-2020s, based on maximum volumes under our existing long-term contracts, we expect to sell up to 16 MMBtu of RNG under these existing off-take agreements on a post-development, long-term basis (i.e., once projects in our development backlog have been built out). 
O&M Services
We perform operating and maintenance services for certain of our JV production facilities and biogas site partners.
Our Production Facilities and Projects
We have a base of production facilities today and a robust pipeline of RNG development opportunities. As of December 31, 2021, we own, through wholly-owned entities or joint ventures, a diversified portfolio of 29 LFG recovery and processing facilities, including 11 operated facilities that produce pipeline-quality RNG and 18 LFG to renewable electricity production facilities, including one non-operated facility and one facility that is not operational. Prior to the consummation of the Business Combinations, the RNG facilities were included in Archaea’s or Aria’s RNG operating segment, and the renewable electricity facilities were included in Aria’s Power operating segment, except for the PEI Power facility in Archbald, PA, which was included in Archaea’s Power operating segment. Excluding our O&M projects owned by third parties, the gas rights associated with our 29 production facilities that are not evergreen are due to expire at varying points over the next 23 years, with gas rights to 5 landfills due to expire by the end of 2031.
Over the next several years, we intend to upgrade certain existing RNG production facilities and convert certain current LFG to renewable electricity facilities to RNG production facilities. These facilities targeted for conversion or upgrade already have gas development agreements in place in addition to site leases, zoning, air permits, and much of the critical infrastructure that is needed to develop RNG projects. We also plan to develop and construct our portfolio of greenfield development opportunities, for which we also already have gas rights agreements in place with biogas site hosts. Our development backlog as of March 15, 2022 includes 38 projects (35 as of December 31, 2021) for which we already have gas right agreements in place, including 10 optimizations and 28 new builds, and we are planning to secure additional RNG development opportunities through new long-term agreements with biogas site hosts. Our gas rights agreements generally require that we achieve commercial operations for a project as of a specified date or the agreement terminates, and the contracts with respect to our greenfield development backlog have a remaining term of approximately one to three years.
One of our key priorities for 2022 is the implementation of our Archaea V1 plant design, a standardized and modularized plant design. We are currently developing four standard plants, to be built on skids and with interchangeable subcomponents, in sizes ranging from 2,000 to 9,600 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) of capacity. Throughout 2021, our focus was primarily on system design and procurement, and our focus this year will be on implementation. We currently have orders in place for the major components for 22 plants. Deliveries of components have begun, and we expect to install our first V1 plant in the second half of this year. We believe these preorders have significantly minimized our near-term supply chain and inflation risks. Our end goal is to build our supply chain and fabrication capabilities to be able to pull Archaea V1 plants “off the shelf” in the future, and our plan is for all new build projects in our 2022 and forward development plan to implement the Archaea V1 design, which we believe will enable us to reduce project development and construction time to 18 months and lower project development costs by about 40% compared to industry averages.

On December 30, 2021, we announced the successful start-up of Project Assai (“Assai”), an RNG facility located at the Keystone Sanitary Landfill in Dunmore, Pennsylvania. Commercial operations were achieved on December 30, 2021, with the introduction of pipeline-quality RNG into the pipeline interconnect located adjacent to the production facility site. Assai is the highest capacity operational RNG facility in the United States.
As of March 15, 2022, we have 12 RNG and 19 LFG to electricity facilities (including three RNG facilities completed and seven electricity facilities acquired since we announced the Business Combinations in April 2021). We currently have 20 projects in our 2022 development plans; however, the timing and ultimate number of projects completed in 2022 is subject to change due to various factors, some of which are outside our control.

Market Opportunity
Increasing Demand for RNG
The demand for RNG produced from biogas has grown significantly over the past several years and is expected to continue to grow for the foreseeable future due to increases in (i) regulatory-driven focus on cleaner energy sources and reduced GHG emissions such as methane, (ii) broad-based corporate support for voluntary renewable energy and sustainability initiatives, and (iii) public sector demand to diversify energy sources from fossil fuel-based alternatives. 
According to the EPA, methane is a significant GHG which accounted for approximately 10% of all U.S. GHG emissions from human activities in 2019 and which has a comparative impact on the atmosphere that is 25 times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. Biogas processing facilities could substantially reduce methane emissions at landfills and livestock farms, which together accounted for approximately 26% of U.S. methane emissions in 2019 according to the EPA.
RNG has traditionally been sold primarily into the transportation sector, where RNG is used in vehicles as CNG or LNG and as a replacement for natural gas from fossil sources. Growth in this market has largely been driven by environmental subsidies to support the production of renewable transportation fuels. We expect demand for RNG as a transportation fuel to continue, and multiple corporations have recently announced they are testing or incorporating sustainable transportation solutions into their fleets using RNG as CNG and LNG.
There is also growing demand for RNG in sectors other than transportation, including as a feedstock for electricity generation, heating and cooking for residential and commercial use, hydrogen production, biomethanol, sustainable aviation fuel. ammonia and other fertilizes, and renewable LNG. We have successfully secured long-term fixed-price off-take agreements with multiple investment-grade counterparties who expect to utilize RNG in these sectors and anticipate that an increased focus on sustainability initiatives and GHG reductions will continue to drive demand growth in these sectors. Numerous utilities, corporations, and universities have recently announced RNG targets or mandates and emphasized the role they expect RNG to play in their decarbonization initiatives. Importantly, our long-term fixed-price RNG off-take agreements are not dependent on the continuation or ratification of any underlying local, state or federal government renewable fuel programs (e.g. RFS, LCFS). RNG can be transported via the existing natural gas pipeline network that spans millions of miles across the United States and Canada, enabling Archaea to deliver RNG to current and prospective customers nearly anywhere in North America.
Availability of Long-Term Feedstock Supply
Biogas is collected and processed to remove impurities for use as RNG, which has the same chemical composition as and can be used interchangeably with traditional natural gas from fossil sources. Common sources of biogas include landfills, livestock farms, wastewater resource recovery facilities, organic waste management operations, and forest and wood products.
We are primarily focused on landfill-sourced biogas and believe there is a significant opportunity for growth in RNG production from landfill gas. The EPA Landfill Methane Outreach Program (“LMOP”) reports approximately 2,600 landfills in the U.S., of which approximately 500 landfills have operational LFG to energy facilities. Some landfills have more than one operational facility, for a total of approximately 550 LFG to energy facilities, of which only 72 are RNG facilities and the remainder are LFG to electricity facilities. We believe we are well-positioned to help convert these LFG to electricity facilities into RNG production facilities. Of the remaining approximately 2,100 landfills that have no form of landfill gas to RNG or electricity generation, the EPA has identified approximately 500 landfills as candidates for future project development.
We have identified actionable growth opportunities and expect to be uniquely positioned and qualified to work with landfill owners to develop new greenfield RNG projects and convert existing renewable electricity facilities to RNG.
The availability of additional biogas sources such as organic waste management, wastewater resource recovery facilities, and livestock farms also have the potential to support the growth of our business.

Government Programs Promoting RNG Growth
RNG generates Environmental Attributes which can be monetized to generate additional revenue. These Environmental Attributes are provided for under several different programs, including RFS and LCFS programs.
The RFS program was authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and expanded through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. At its most basic level, it requires the use of specific volumes of biofuel in the U.S. and is aimed at (i) increasing energy security by reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and establishing domestic green fuel related industries and (ii) improving the environment through the reduction of GHG emissions.
Under the RFS program, transportation fuel sold in the U.S. must contain a certain minimum volume of renewable fuel. To enforce compliance, the EPA began using RINs as a means to track the production, use, and trading of renewable fuels. A RIN is generated when an EPA-registered renewable fuel producer produces renewable fuel that is then dispensed as transportation fuel. The type of RIN a renewable fuel producer can generate is determined by the reduction in GHG emissions compared to the gasoline or diesel baseline. Fuels are categorized by “D-code” depending on these GHG emission reductions. Each type of renewable fuel also carries an EV that determines how many RINs a renewable fuel producer can generate with each gallon of renewable fuel produced. Finally, the EPA regulates the amount of RINs the industry as a whole must obtain and retire on an annual basis.
Our LFG-to-RNG production facilities generate D3, or cellulosic biofuels, RINs for which there is high demand due to supply constraints and the ability of D3 RINs to fulfill obligations in other D-Code categories. For example, a D3 RIN can be used to fulfill obligations in both the D5 and D6 categories, as well as in the D3 category. The EPA refers to this concept as “nesting.” Moreover, the most restrictive standards apply to the cellulosic biofuel category, including a 60% GHG reduction and a 1.0 to 1.5 EV, resulting in a limited number of qualifying fuels which meet the corresponding standards.
On the state level, the economics of RNG are enhanced by low-carbon fuel initiatives, particularly well-established programs in California and Oregon, a program in Washington expected to begin in 2023 or 2024, and several other states also actively considering LCFS initiatives. LCFS regulations are aimed at reducing the CI of transportation fuel sold and purchased in the applicable state. A CI score is calculated as grams of CO2-equivalent per megajoule of energy of the fuel. The CI score is dependent upon a full lifecycle analysis that evaluates the GHG emissions associated with producing, transporting, and consuming the fuel. LCFS credits can be generated in three ways: (i) fuel pathway crediting that provides low carbon fuels used in California transportation; (ii) project-based crediting that reduces GHG emissions in the petroleum supply chain; and (iii) zero emission vehicle crediting that supports the buildout of infrastructure. These credits are awarded to RNG projects based on each project’s CI score relative to the targeted CI score for both gasoline and diesel fuels. The number of monetizable LCFS credits per unit of fuel increases with a lower CI score. 
We believe credits generated under the RFS and LCFS programs can provide meaningful revenue upside but also note that their pricing has historically been volatile and remains difficult to forecast. While we intend to sell a portion of our RNG production and associated Environmental Attributes at market prices and thus capture the value of prevailing RIN and LCFS credits, we aim to cap our merchant (variable) exposure to approximately 30% of RNG volumes, with the remaining approximately 70% contracted under long-term fixed price off-take agreements in which the customer retains the value of the Environmental Attributes. This strategy of locking in the majority of volumes under take-or-pay contracts with no Environmental Attribute pricing risk differentiates us from most of our competitors in the RNG space today. 
Customers
We seek to be a reliable long-term provider of lower-carbon energy to help our off-take partners decarbonize and achieve their sustainability goals. Our customers include utilities, corporations, universities, municipalities, and marketers. We sell RNG and related Environmental Attributes primarily to municipalities, corporations, and marketers. We sell electricity and RECs primarily to utilities and ISOs.
Because our projects depend on sales of RNG, electricity, and Environmental Attributes to certain key purchasers, our projects are highly dependent upon these customers fulfilling their contractual obligations under their respective PPAs or GSAs. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.

Competition
There are many other companies operating in the renewable energy and RNG production space, and we face competition both on rights to manage or develop LFG projects and the prices we receive for our RNG and renewable electricity. In the LFG industry, we believe our primary competitors are other LFG companies with existing projects and landfill owners that either operate their own LFG projects or may do so in the future. We compete with these companies to acquire LFG rights for additional project development, existing LFG projects, or in some cases to renew or extend existing gas rights. Increased competition for such projects may increase the price we pay for gas rights, the acquisition costs for existing projects or the royalties or other payments we have to pay landfill owners, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may also find ourselves competing more frequently with landfill owners to the extent they decide to exercise their purchase rights that exist under certain of our gas rights agreements or otherwise develop their own LFG projects, which would also reduce the number of opportunities for us to develop new LFG projects. We also compete with other RNG developers for long-term fixed-price off-take agreements with existing and potential buyers of RNG.
Evolving consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, ongoing waste industry trends, and project economics have a strong effect on the competitive landscape. The biogas and RNG markets are heavily fragmented. We believe we are in a strong position to compete for new project development and supply opportunities, as well as additional off-take agreements, due to our technical expertise, relationships across the industry, scale, breadth of our operating platform, and capital structure. However, competition for such opportunities, including the prices being offered for fuel supply, may impact profitability of opportunities to us and may make opportunities unsuitable to pursue.
Seasonality
To some extent, we experience seasonality in our results of operations. Short-term sales of RNG may be impacted by higher consumption of vehicle fuels by some of our customers in the summer months, when buses and other fleet vehicles use more fuel to power their air conditioning systems, which typically translate to an increased volume of fuel delivered in the summer months. In addition, natural gas commodity prices tend to be higher in the fall and winter months, due to increased overall demand for natural gas for heating during these periods.
Revenues generated from our renewable electricity production facilities in the northeast U.S., all of which sell electricity at market prices, are affected by warmer and colder weather, and therefore a portion of our quarterly operating results and cash flows are affected by pricing changes due to regional temperatures. These seasonal variances are managed in part by certain off-take agreements at fixed prices.
Cold weather can cause our plants to experience freeze-offs and power outages, resulting in more downtime than under warm weather conditions. Shipping delays for replacement parts and construction materials may also be more frequent during the winter months leading to incremental downtime or construction delays. In addition, lower ambient temperatures result in lower biogas production from our anaerobic digesters and may result in changes to landfill gas composition during the winter months which have the potential to cause incremental downtime. Our energy production can also be affected during the summer months, as very warm temperatures can dry out a landfill if the landfill owner is unable to keep the landfill covered, which in turn reduces the LFG generated at the site.
Human Capital 
We have a total of 292 full time employees as of December 31, 2021. None of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining agreements.
The success and growth of our business is significantly correlated with our ability to recruit, train, promote and retain talented individuals at all levels of our organization. To succeed in a competitive labor market, we have developed and maintain key recruitment and retention strategies. These include competitive salary structures, including bonus and equity compensation programs, competitive benefits policies, including paid time off for vacations, sick leave and holidays, short-term disability coverage, group term life insurance, and retirement savings plans. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee well-being, health and safety.

Governmental Regulation
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, zoning and land use, public reporting and taxation, among others. These regulations and policies are subject to amendment, which could result in a significant future reduction in the potential demand or incentives available for renewable energy (including Environmental Attributes that certain forms of renewable energy may generate), renewable energy project development and investments. Any new government regulations applicable to our renewable energy projects or markets for renewable energy may result in significant additional expenses or related development costs and, as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our renewable energy. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in the disconnection and/or shutdown of the non-complying facility, our inability to sell electricity or RNG from the non-complying facility, the voiding or disqualification of Environmental Attributes generated in association with our operations, the default of any contracts that we have for the sales that were to be made from the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and penalties, forfeiture of certain payments we have made, refunds and interest, or civil or criminal liability.
On the state level, the economics of RNG are enhanced by low-carbon fuel initiatives, particularly well-established programs in California and Oregon, with several other states also actively considering similar LCFS initiatives.
Our market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules established by FERC, and if any of our generating companies are deemed to have violated those rules, we will be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation, penalties, refunds of unlawfully collected amounts with interest, suspension or revocation of MBR authority. If such generating companies were to lose their MBR authority, they would be required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a cost of service rate schedule and could become subject to the significant accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are typically imposed on vertically-integrated utilities with cost based rate schedules. This could have a material adverse effect on the rates we are able to charge for power from our facilities. The regulatory environment for electric generation has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to state and federal policies affecting wholesale competition and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable generation and, in some cases, transmission assets. These changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on our business. 
Environmental Regulation
Our operations, as well as our feedstock suppliers, are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge or release of materials into the environment, environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of various substances, including hazardous substances and waste and as a result of any spills, releases, discharges and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that our facilities, sites and other properties be operated, maintained, decommissioned and restored to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Occupational health and safety regulations establish standards protective of workers. These laws, as amended from time to time, include, for example: 
•the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), which regulates air emission pollutants, GHG emissions and reciprocating engines subject to Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards;
•the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), which establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and serves to regulate the discharge of wastewater from our facilities into state and federal waters;
•the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, which regulates the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent hazardous substances for disposal;
•the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct”), which, among other things, establishes requirements for minimum volumes of renewable fuels in transportation fuel;
•the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances and appropriate control measures; 
Table of Contents

•the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), which imposes requirements for the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes at or from our facilities; and
•various state and local laws, which may include analogs to the above or other or more stringent requirements.
An accidental release from one of our facilities could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury, natural resource and property damages and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Moreover, under certain environmental laws such as CERCLA and RCRA, we could incur strict joint and several liability for remediating hazardous substances or wastes disposed of or released by us or prior owners or operators. We also could incur costs related to the clean-up of third-party sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal or to which we sent equipment for cleaning. Failure to comply with these federal, state and local laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of delays, denials or cancellations in permitting or the development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in affected areas. For more information, see our risk factor titled “Our operations, as well as those of our feedstock suppliers, are subject to numerous stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.”
