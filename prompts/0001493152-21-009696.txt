ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
Business Overview
 
Alliance Bioenergy Plus, Inc., was incorporated in Nevada on March 28, 2012, as Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. Since December 2013, Alliance Bioenergy Plus, Inc dba Blue Biofuels (the “Company”) has been a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy, biofuels, and bioplastics technology sectors. For a number of years, the Company attempted to commercialize a technology it had licensed, through a partially owned subsidiary, that converted cellulosic materials into sugars for use in the biofuels industry. That technology proved to be inefficient and not economic.
 
In January 2018, the Company’s technology experts developed a technology system it calls Cellulose-to-Sugar or CTS 2.0, and a process patent application was filed. The patent is still pending but with notice of allowance granted. The same patent was filed in all major jurisdictions of the world including the European Patent Organization, Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization, and the Russian Federation. The Company is working on filing additional patents.
 
CTS 2.0 is a mechanical/chemical dry process for converting cellulose material into sugar for use in the biofuels industry. The 100% owned CTS 2.0 system can convert virtually any cellulosic material – like grasses, wood, paper, farm waste, yard waste, forestry products, energy crops like hemp or King Grass, and the cellulosic portion of municipal solid waste – into sugars and subsequently into biofuels and bioplastics. CTS 2.0 has a near zero carbon footprint, recycles the water and catalyst, and uses no enzymes, expensive chemicals, or strong acids.

At commercial scale, management expects to be able to produce ethanol at a lower cost than any competitor due to the fact that the CTS 2.0 process is uncomplicated and efficient, and that it uses low cost feedstock as compared to corn. The ethanol industry is highly competitive with over 200 ethanol plants in the United States alone. Currently, the vast majority use corn as the feedstock. Their profitability depends highly on the fluctuations between the price of corn and the price of ethanol. The Company plans on using King Grass as its initial feedstock, which is significantly less expensive per dry ton than corn.
 
The perceived value of the new technology made it worthwhile to financially restructure the company through the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy process. Beginning in 2015 (while the Company was still under the control of prior management) the Company obtained working capital loans through the issuance of a series of short-term, high-interest “toxic” notes to fund expenses. In late 2017, after the prior licensed technology proved to be noneconomic, the Company found itself with insufficient available cash to repay the toxic loans that then were then coming due. As a result, the lenders converted their notes into equity at 35-50% rolling discounts to the market price, thereby driving the stock price from $.20 cents to $.03 per share. At this time, certain major shareholders invested additional amounts in the Company in an effort to prevent further decline in the stock price. In January 2018, these major shareholders also paid off what they were led to believe was the remaining toxic debt that was not yet eligible to be converted into equity. In April 2018, the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 was filed revealing recent events that the then Company management not only incurred more toxic debt in late 2017 and early 2018, but that $612,556.00 of such debt required approximately $1.0 million cash to retire. Following these disclosures, new directors were appointed who proceeded to remove prior management. In June, 2018, the Company took actions to prevent further conversions of toxic debt, which resulted in the toxic debt lenders commencing breach of note/collection actions in New York and California, with the Company seeking to dismiss those claims on grounds of usury. In the meantime, in March, 2018, an engineering firm (Process Engineering Associates, LLC) that had done work on the non-economically viable older technology, obtained a default final judgment against the Company entered by a Tennessee state court in the principal amount of $134,318.26 plus statutory post-judgment interest, which final judgment was subsequently domesticated in Florida. In July 2018, the Company’s former controller sued the Company in Florida state court for several million dollars for various claims arising from the Company’s termination of his employment contract. Finally, at around the same time, various other creditors had sued, threatened to sue, or were demanding a payment plan from the Debtor. Between the judgments and lawsuits, as of October, 2018, the Debtor had four legal proceedings pending against it in four separate courts throughout the country with no available cash to fund the defense of these actions after its bank accounts were frozen by the Process Engineering garnishment in or around September, 2018.
 
As a result, the Company’s new board and management determined that a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing was its only plausible alternative to save the company as a going concern for the benefit of creditors and stockholders. The Company voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 on October 22, 2018, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida. Management fought, eliminated, and restructured millions in debts and disputed debts, and exited Chapter 11 on September 18, 2019, while keeping all classes, including the shareholders, unimpaired. The above mentioned debts were either voided, renegotiated down and paid off, or renegotiated to be paid out of future revenues ($1,820,630) or renegotiated to be paid out of future profits ($917,502). These are reflected on the Company’s financial statements. A complete copy of the Plan of Reorganization is filed as Exhibit 2(a). Having paid all debts that needed to be paid, the bankruptcy case was closed on October 25, 2019.
 
The Company’s goal is to further develop and commercialize its 100% owned CTS 2.0 technology that was discovered and developed in house. In July 2020, the Company began testing a 4th generation prototype to further optimize various parameters towards the engineering of a commercial size reactor. The 4th generation has 30 times the capacity as the 3rd generation. It is in the process of being upgraded to handle higher volumes of feedstock. The Company expects to build a 5th generation semi-commercial scale system in 2021 that should be of sufficient size – at least a ton of sugar per day production rate – to prove the commercial viability of the technology. Due to its mechanical nature and modularity, it is anticipated that one plant would have multiple modular CTS systems. After the system is commercially ready, the Company will either form a joint venture with an ethanol producer or acquire an existing ethanol plant and retrofit it with the CTS 2.0 technology to more rapidly achieve revenue.

The biofuels industry is highly regulated. Any new plant that is built would require various government permits.
 
The Company has a strategy that includes using its low-cost high-purity lignin co-product to produce biodegradable bioplastics. The plastics industry is highly competitive. The Company would need various government permits before commercializing products in this space, and it is too preliminary to discuss more details.
 
The Company has also licensed the Vertimass Process to convert ethanol (from the CTS 2.0 process) into bio-jet fuel. There is no up-front or annual fee until we are converting ethanol into bio-jet fuel. The license agreement with Vertimass is the subject of a confidentiality agreement between the parties. Since we are not yet producing ethanol on a commercial scale, it is too preliminary to discuss details.
 
The Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the development of technologies from concept to commercialization. As of this date, the Company has not generated any material revenues from its business.
 
Description of the Company’s Securities
 
The Company is currently authorized to issue 500,000,000 Shares of Common Stock par value $0.001 and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock par value $0.001. Each share of Company Common Stock is entitled to one (1) vote per share.
 
Employees
 
The company currently employs four full-time employees, five part-time employee and six consultants. The Company is in the process of hiring additional employees to more rapidly commercialize its technology.
