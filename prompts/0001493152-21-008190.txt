ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Adhera Therapeutics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, MDRNA Research, Inc. (“MDRNA”), Cequent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Cequent”), Atossa Healthcare, Inc. (“Atossa”), and IThenaPharma, Inc. (“IThena”) (collectively “Adhera,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), is an emerging specialty biotech company that, to the extent that resources and opportunities become available, is strategically evaluating its focus including a return to a drug discovery and development company.
 
As a result, as of the date of this report, we are not engaged in any research, development or commercialization activities, and we are not generating any revenues from operations. Moreover, as of the date of this report, we do not have any personnel other than a contracted Chief Executive Officer.
 
Since the end of 2019, to the extent that resources have been available, we have been working with our advisors to restructure our company and to identify potential strategic transactions to enhance the value of our company as such opportunities arise, including potential transactions and capital raising initiatives involving the assets relating to our legacy RNA interference programs, as well as business combination transactions with operating companies. There can be no assurance that we will be successful at identifying any such transactions, that we will continue to have sufficient resources to actively attempt to identify such transactions, or that such transactions will be available upon terms acceptable to us or at all. If we do not complete any significant strategic transactions, or raise substantial additional capital, in the immediate future, it is likely that we will discontinue all operations and seek bankruptcy protection.
 
Background
 
On November 15, 2016, Adhera entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with IThenaPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation, IThena Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of IThena (“Merger Sub”), and a representative of the stockholders of IThena (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into IThena, with IThena surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adhera (such transaction, the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, the former holders of IThena common stock immediately prior to the completion of the Merger owned approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of Adhera common stock immediately following the completion of the Merger.
 
Adhera was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name Nastech Pharmaceutical Company on September 23, 1983, and IThena was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 3, 2014. IThena is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger, and thus the historical financial statements of IThena will be treated as the historical financial statements of our company and will be reflected in our quarterly and annual reports for periods ending after the effective time of the Merger. Accordingly, beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we started to report the results of IThena and Adhera and their respective subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
 
Subsequent to the Merger, we executed on our strategy to become a commercial stage pharmaceutical company by acquiring Prestalia from Symplmed Pharmaceuticals LLC in June 2017. Prestalia is an FDA-approved and marketed anti-hypertensive drug. Prestalia is an FDC of perindopril arginine, which is an ACE inhibitor, and amlodipine besylate, which is a calcium-channel blocker and is indicated as a first line therapy for hypertension control. The acquisition of Prestalia transitioned our company from a clinical stage company to a commercial organization. We re-introduced Prestalia into the U.S. market in June 2018, with continued promotion through December 2019, at which time we terminated our business operations, including the commercialization of Prestalia.
 
Prestalia was developed in coordination with Les Laboratories, Servier, a French pharmaceutical conglomerate, that sells the formulation outside the United States under the brand names Coveram® and/or Viacoram®. Prestalia was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in January 2015, and was distributed through our patented DyrctAxess platform.

On January 4, 2021, Servier terminated its licensing agreement with us and all rights related to future commercialization activities related to the product.
 
Need for Future Financing
 
We will require substantial additional funds on an immediate basis to continue our business operations. We have, in the past, raised additional capital to supplement our commercialization, clinical and pre-clinical development and operational expenses. We will need to raise additional funds through equity financing, debt financing, strategic alliances, or other sources, which may result in significant further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares or result in further encumbrances being placed on our assets. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or that it will be sufficient for us to successfully engage in any of our planned business operations, including re-starting the drug development and discovery programs relating to our legacy RNA interference assets. If we are not able to obtain additional financing on a timely basis as required or generate significant capital from the out-licensing and/or divestiture of existing assets, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and will be forced to scale down or even cease our operations altogether.
Partnering and Licensing Agreements
 
Les Laboratoires Servier
 
As a result of the Asset Purchase Agreement that we entered into with Symplmed Pharmaceuticals LLC in June 2017, Symplmed Pharmaceuticals assigned to us all of its rights and obligations under that certain Amended and Restated License and Commercialization Agreement by and between Symplmed Pharmaceuticals and Les Laboratoires Servier (“Servier”) dated January 2012. Pursuant to the License Agreement, we have an exclusive license from Servier to manufacture, have manufactured, develop, promote, market, distribute and sell Prestalia in the U.S. (and its territories and possessions) in consideration of the regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, and royalty payments based on net sales, described therein. As per the License Agreement, as amended, Servier has the right to terminate the License Agreement in various circumstances, including, without limitation, if net sales of Prestalia are below $1 million for two successive calendar quarters beginning after June 30, 2020. On January 4, 2021, Servier terminated the agreement for the marketing and commercialization of Prestalia.
 
Autotelic LLC
 
On November 15, 2016, we entered into a License Agreement with Autotelic LLC pursuant to which (A) we licensed to Autotelic LLC certain patent rights, data and know-how relating to FAP and nasal insulin, for human therapeutics other than for oncology-related therapies and indications, and (B) Autotelic LLC licensed to us certain patent rights, data and know-how relating to IT-102 and IT-103, in connection with individualized therapy of pain using a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and an anti-hypertensive without inducing intolerable edema, and treatment of certain aspects of proliferative disease, but not including rights to IT-102/IT-103 for TDM guided dosing for all indications using an Autotelic Inc. TDM Device. We also granted a right of first refusal to Autotelic LLC with respect to any license by us of the rights licensed by or to us under the License Agreement in any cancer indication outside of gastrointestinal cancers. As per the Omnibus Settlement Agreement that we entered into on October 1, 2018 with Dr. Trieu, Autotelic LLC and certain other parties affiliated with Dr. Trieu, the License Agreement shall continue, provided that Autotelic LLC shall be licensee and have a license to, without representation or warranty, nasal apomorphine and nasal scopolamine and related intellectual property in addition to nasal insulin, and Autotelic LLC shall not be a licensee or have a license to FAP or CEQ508 and related intellectual property.
 
Hongene Biotechnology
 
In September 2015, Adhera entered into a license agreement with Hongene, a leader in process development and analytical method development of oligonucleotide therapeutics, regarding the development and supply of certain oligonucleotide constructs using our CRN technology. To date, there has been minimal activity under this agreement. However, as per the terms of the agreement, we could receive double digit percentage royalties on the sales of research reagents using our CRN technology.

Rosetta
 
On April 1, 2014, we entered into a strategic alliance with Rosetta to identify and develop microRNA- (“miRNA”) based products designed to diagnose and treat various neuromuscular diseases and dystrophies. Under the terms of the alliance, Rosetta will apply its industry leading miRNA discovery expertise for the identification of miRNAs involved in the various dystrophy diseases. If the miRNA is determined to be correlative to the disease, Rosetta may further develop the miRNA into a diagnostic for patient identification and stratification. If the miRNA is determined to be involved in the disease pathology and represents a potential therapeutic target, Adhera may develop the resulting miRNA-based therapeutic for clinical development. The alliance is exclusive as it relates to neuromuscular diseases and dystrophies, with both companies free to develop and collaborate outside this field both during and after the terms of the alliance.
Novartis
 
On August 2, 2012, we and Novartis entered into a worldwide, non-exclusive License Agreement for the CRN technology for the development of both single and double-stranded oligonucleotide therapeutics. Novartis made a $1.0 million one-time payment for the non-exclusive license. In addition, in March 2009, we granted to Novartis a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to the DiLA2-based siRNA delivery platform in consideration of a one-time, non-refundable fee of $7.25 million. Novartis may terminate this agreement immediately upon written notice.
Novosom
 
On July 27, 2010, we acquired the intellectual property of Novosom for SMARTICLES. As per the terms of the acquisition agreement (the “Original Purchase Agreement”), we were required to pay to Novosom an amount equal to 30% of the value of each upfront (or combined) payment actually received in respect of the license of liposomal-based delivery technology or related product or disposition of the liposomal-based delivery technology by us, up to $3.3 million, which amount was to be paid in shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our discretion. On September 8, 2017, we entered into an Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement (the “IP Purchase Agreement”) with Novosom pursuant to which we sold to Novosom substantially all of our intellectual property estate relating to SMARTICLES (the “Smarticles IP”), including that acquired pursuant to the Original Purchase Agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.00. As per an amendment to the IP Purchase Agreement, we assigned to Novosom those agreements that we entered into with third parties pursuant to which we provided to such third parties certain licenses and rights with respect to the Smarticles IP, including the right to receive milestone and royalty payments, if any. Novosom made to us a cash payment in the amount of $45,000 in connection with the amendment to the IP Purchase Agreement.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals
 
On March 23, 2010, we acquired intellectual property related to the CRN chemistry from Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America (“Valeant”). Subject to meeting certain milestones triggering the obligation to make any such payments, we may be obligated to make a product development milestone payment of $5.0 million and $2.0 million within 180 days of FDA approval of an NDA for our first and second CRN related product, respectively. To date, we have not made any such milestone payments but have milestone obligations of $0.1 million based on CRN licenses to date. Valeant is entitled to receive earn-outs based upon a percentage in the low single digits of future commercial sales and earn-outs based upon a percentage in the low double digits of future revenue from sublicensing. We are required to pay Valeant an annual amount equal to $50,000 per assigned patent which shall be creditable against other payment obligations. The term of our financial obligations under the agreement shall end, on a country-by-country basis, when there no longer exists any valid claim in such country. We may terminate the agreement upon 30-day notice, or upon 10-day notice in the event of adverse results from clinical studies.

Proprietary Rights and Intellectual Property
 
We have relied primarily on patents and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought, and, to the extent that we continue our business operations, intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. To date, the U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications that we have filed, and the patents that have been granted to us, relate to our legacy intranasal and RNA interference programs. As noted elsewhere in this report, we are in the process of evaluating the path forward for such programs, including seeking options to continue certain programs or to divest assets. There can be no assurance that any of our patents will be guaranteed protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates, and to the extent that we do not properly maintain (including paying any required fees) such patents, it is possible that any protection provided to us will be impaired or lost altogether.
 
We also use license agreements both to access external technologies and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. To the extent that we continue our business operations, our financial success will be dependent in part on our ability to obtain (and maintain) commercially valuable patent claims and to protect our intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.
 
Further, as discussed elsewhere in this report, we had licensed rights to our FDA-approved product, Prestalia, from Les Laboratoires Servier as a result of our acquisition of assets from Symplmed Pharmaceuticals in June 2017. The patents listed in the FDA Orange Book as having claims covering Prestalia, U.S. Patent No. 6,696,481 and 7,846,961, expire in 2023 and 2029, respectively. On January 4, 2021, the Servier terminated the licensing for the preceeding patents. We also hold a patent to our DyrctAxess technology platform (U.S. Patent No. 8,738,398).
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We terminated our commercial activities related to Prestalia in 2019. Sales and marketing activities in 2020, were primarily related to regulatory activities to maintain the Prestalia NDA.
 
Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of any products and product candidates that we may develop or acquire, to the extent that we may continue to engage in the biopharmaceutical industry, are their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. While we believe that our technology, knowledge and experience provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major and minor pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Our products, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and/or acquire, and later commercialize, will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
We anticipate that many of the companies against which we may compete in the future will have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, product acquisition, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete, or may compete, with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and products complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.
 
The commercial opportunity for any product candidates that we may acquire and/or develop could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs or therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may acquire or develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drugs and pharmaceutical products. To the extent that we continue to engage in the biopharmaceutical industry, of which there can be no assurance, all of the products that we anticipate seeking to develop and/or commercialize are expected to be regulated as drug products.
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and other laws within the Public Health Service Act. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecutions. Before any drug products that we may develop and/or acquire are marketed, they must be approved by the FDA. The steps required before a drug product is approved by the FDA include: (1) pre-clinical laboratory, animal, and formulation tests; (2) submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; (3) adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product for each indication for which approval is sought; (4) submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”); (5) satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and FDA review; and finally (6) approval of an NDA.
 
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions, such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. There can be no assurance that submission of an IND will result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. Once an IND is in effect, each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified physician-investigators and healthcare personnel. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 usually involves the initial administration of the investigational drug or biologic product to healthy individuals to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacodynamics. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, with the disease or condition for which the test material is being developed, to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks; and preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate effectiveness and test further for safety by administering the drug or biologic candidate in its final form in an expanded patient population. To the extent that we engage in any product development activities, our product development partners, the FDA, or we may suspend clinical trials, if any, at any time on various grounds, including any situation where we or our partners believe that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or are obtaining no medical benefit from the test material.
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical trials and the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Before approving an application, the FDA will usually inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA determines the NDA is not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the NDA and often will request additional information. If the FDA approves the NDA, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any approval of any products that we develop and/or acquire will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA granted orphan drug designation to CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP in December 2010. We are evaluating the best path forward to re-start development activities regarding CEQ508, and evaluating options for our other programs relating to RNA interference.
 
In addition, regardless of the type of approval, to the extent that we continue to engage in the biopharmaceutical industry, we and our partners will be required to comply with a number of FDA requirements both before and after approval with respect to any products that we may develop, acquire or commercialize. For example, we and our partners will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for products. In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including production and quality control to comply with cGMP. In addition, discovery of problems, such as safety problems, may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or NDA holder, including removal of the product from the market.
 
In addition to FDA regulations for the marketing of pharmaceutical products, there are various other state and federal laws that may restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These include the following:
 

● | The federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback laws, which prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment; 
● | The federal False Claims Act which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government; 
● | The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government officials; 
● | State and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations; 
● | The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which among other things changes access to healthcare products and services; creates new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries; changes rebates and prices for health care products and services; and requires additional reporting and disclosure; and 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which imposes requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;

 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 
To the extent that any of the products that we develop and/or acquire are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. None of our products were ever sold outside the United States.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 
To the extent that we continue to engage in the biopharmaceutical industry, the commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. In the United States, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage, attempting to limit reimbursement levels or regulate the price of drugs and other medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. For example, in the United States, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and Tricare. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. Moreover, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payers and other governmental payers develop their coverage and reimbursement policies.
 
In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which, to the extent that we are commercializing products, may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved products. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for any products that we may acquire and/or develop.
 
Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“the MMA”) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription, pharmacy drugs pursuant to federal regulations. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. In general, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors have flexibility regarding coverage of Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class, with certain exceptions. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products that we commercialize. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be discounted, thereby lowering the net price realized on our sales to pharmacies. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.
 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of any product candidates that we may acquire and/or develop. If third-party payers do not consider the product candidates that we may acquire and/or develop to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.

The United States is considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to profitably sell any products that we may acquire and/or develop. Among policy makers and payers in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, the Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), which became law in March 2010 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the ACA establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; expansion of Medicaid benefits and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and expansion of the 340B drug discount program that mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers and other qualifying providers. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for any product candidates that we acquire and/or develop once they are approved.
 
For example, members of Congress and the current presidential administration have expressed an intent to pass legislation or adopt executive orders to fundamentally change or repeal parts of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation to date, several actions have been taken that revise and/or impact the ACA, including, without limitation, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 that, among other things, amended the ACA to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” Congress may consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA. The implications of the ACA, its possible repeal, any legislation that may be proposed to replace the ACA, or the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation for our future business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear.
 
The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the U.S. recently has also been the subject of considerable discussion in the U.S., and members of Congress and the current presidential administration have stated that they will address such costs through new legislative and administrative measures. To date, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the current presidential administration have each indicated that it will continue to pursue new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
 
Individual state legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing. Some of these measures include price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for any products we may acquire and/or develop, once approved, or put pressure on the pricing of such products.
 
Additionally, the continued consolidation in healthcare of insurers, providers, large healthcare delivery systems and clinical research organizations is an additional source of change and resource constraint which may impact our ability to acquire, develop and commercialize product candidates.
 
We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal and state legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives in the U.S. to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from any products that we may acquire and/or develop, and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to realize the full value of our product(s), if any, as they are developed and ultimately commercialized.

Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products Hatch-Waxman Patent Exclusivity
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or 505(b)(2) NDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication.
 
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA in the product application concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

● | the required patent information has not been filed; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the listed patent has expired; 
● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product. 

 
Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent or if the listed patent is a patented method of use for which approval is not being sought. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant or other period determined by a court.
 
Hatch-Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity
 
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.

The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Product Liability
 
We currently have no product liability insurance. We believe this is appropriate for our stage of development as we currently have no commercial products. Any product liability insurance we have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Environmental Compliance
 
To the extent that we begin to re-engage in research and development activities, which activities are not currently being actively pursued by us, such activities may involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specific waste products. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant and may adversely affect capital expenditures to the extent we are required to procure expensive capital equipment to meet regulatory requirements.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021, we had no employees. Our current Chief Executive Officer and services related to our accounting and financial management are being performed by independent contractors.
