ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General



We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Form 10-K as our initial business combination.



To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the initial public offering and the search of a target company for a Business Combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.



We have established strategic relationships with selected leading investors and financing providers, which we refer to as the “Strategic Partners.” Our advisors (“Advisors”) are former Department of Homeland Security, FBI, U.S Cyber Command, CYBERCOM, and Crowdstrike cybersecurity experts. We also have venture capitalist and cyber technology company founders. Such Strategic Partners and Advisors may invest in and hold positions in our sponsor, including Betsy Z. Cohen who is a member of the Sponsor, thereby sharing in the appreciation of founder shares and/or private placement units, and assist us in sourcing and evaluating potential acquisition targets and creating long-term value in the business combination.



Phyllis Newhouse who serves as our Chief Executive Officer, Grace Vandecruze, who serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Janice Bryant Howroyd, who serves as one of our directors, also served as directors and/or officers of Athena Technology Acquisition Corp., a blank check company that consummated its initial public offering in March 2021. In conjunction with a successful PIPE raise of $165,000,000, in July 2021, Athena Technology Acquisition Corp. entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination with Heliogen, Inc, a provider of AI-enabled concentrated solar power, which closed on December 30, 2021.



We may pursue an initial business combination in any business or industry but expect to focus on a target in an industry where we believe the expertise of our management team and Advisors will provide us with a competitive advantage. Our expertise lends itself well to pursuing technology, and cybersecurity platforms, but we are not required to complete our initial business combination with a business in these industries, and as a result, we may pursue a business combination outside of these industries. We do not intend to acquire companies that have speculative business plans or carry excessive leverage.

Business Strategy



Our business strategy is to leverage well-known investment platforms to identify, evaluate and complete an initial business combination with a company that we believe exhibits unrecognized value with platform for a consolidation. Although we intend to acquire a company that has sufficient scale to be a successful public company on its own, we believe that many consolidation opportunities exist in the technology and cybersecurity sectors.



For example, we believe that corporate customers are increasingly seeking diversified cybersecurity platforms that can provide multiple services across the security ecosystem. We do not intend to limit our search to one segment of the technology and cybersecurity industries but will instead target a wide variety of companies that provide an array of business technical support. We believe that our management team’s extensive experience and demonstrated success in both investing and operating businesses in this industry has culminated in a unique set of capabilities that will be utilized in generating stockholder returns.



Following completion of the initial public offering, our management and advisors have been communicating with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination and begin the process of evaluating potential opportunities.



Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in assessing potential acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:




● | have a strong, experienced management team, or have a platform to assemble an effective management team with a track record of driving growth and profitability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have a defensible market position, with demonstrated advantages when compared to their competitors and create barriers to entry against new competitors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise to drive improved financial performance and will benefit from innovative operational techniques;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are fundamentally sound companies that may be underperforming their potential;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exhibit unrecognized value or other favorable characteristics, generate desirable return on capital, and need the capital injection to further accelerate the growth;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | will offer an attractive risk adjusted returns for our stockholders, potential upside from growth in the target markets and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | can benefit from being a publicly traded company, are prepared to be a publicly traded company, and can utilize access to broader capital markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Form 10-K, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.

In addition to any potential acquisition targets, we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target businesses will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including our Advisors, Strategic Partners, private equity funds, investment banks, and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.



Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets



We believe our management team’s significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses through their relationships with sellers, financing sources and target companies’ management teams and through executing a number of transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.



We believe this network will provide our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which are proprietary or where a limited group of investors were invited to participate in the sale process. In addition, we anticipate that potential acquisition targets will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, directors or officers. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.



As more fully discussed in “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our directors and officers currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.



Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company:




● | in an industry that complements the experience and expertise of our management team and our Advisors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | was founded with the clear vision of having powerful and differentiated relationships with their customers and that has market-leading insight into how their consumers live, what they need, and how to communicate with them effectively; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creates, produces, owns, distributes and/or markets the content, products and services or facilitates the sharing economy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe there are many potential targets that meet these criteria that could become attractive public companies with long-term growth potential and attractive competitive positioning.



We will seek to:




● | leverage the strategic and transaction experience of our management team and Advisors to bring advice and attention to potential targets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | deliver creative, multi-faceted approaches to transaction sourcing; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------






5








● | utilize an understanding of global financial markets and events, capital markets and overall corporate strategy options, including experience in evaluating company’s readiness for public markets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our strategy is to leverage broad expertise, unique networks and the strategic and transaction experience of our management team and Advisors to identify and execute an initial business combination, which we believe will result in an acquisition and overall value enhancement of our target.



Our selection process will leverage our network of industry professionals, the contacts of our management and Advisors, as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, restructuring advisers, attorneys and accountants, which we believe will provide us with a number of business combination opportunities.



We intend to deploy a proactive, thematic sourcing strategy and to focus on companies where we believe the combination of our management and operational experience, relationships and capital markets expertise can be catalysts to transform a target company and can help accelerate the target’s growth and performance. Following completion of the initial public offering, members of our management team and our Advisors have been communicating with their network of relationships to articulate our initial business combination criteria, including the parameters of our search for a target, and will begin the disciplined process of pursuing and reviewing promising leads.



Our management team has experience in sourcing, structuring, acquiring and selling businesses; fostering relationships with sellers, capital providers and target management teams; negotiating transactions with terms favorable for investors; executing transactions in multiple geographies and under varying economic and financial market conditions; and accessing the capital markets, including financing businesses and helping companies transition to public ownership.



Our Advisors have experience in operating companies, setting and changing strategies, and identifying, monitoring and recruiting world-class talent; acquiring and integrating companies; and developing and growing companies, both organically and through acquisitions, and strategic transactions and through expanding the product range and geographic footprint of a number of target businesses.



We further believe that our unique perspective as a vision driven company ourselves will enhance our attractiveness to potential target companies aligned with our vision. We believe that target companies will see the value in working with us as they embark on the path toward public ownership. To those companies, we are a like-minded partner with a broad support network that enhances our marketability to them.



Competitive Strengths



We believe reputation, sourcing, valuation, diligence and execution capabilities of our management team and our Advisors will provide us with a significant pipeline of opportunities from which to evaluate and select a business that will benefit from our expertise and create value for our stockholders.



Our competitive strengths include the following:



Strong Motivation to Fulfill our Purpose and our Vision. The team we have assembled to execute on capital formation and on an initial business combination, including our management, Advisors, underwriters, legal advisors, auditors and accountants, have all expressed dedication to our vision and therefore understand the wider significance and impact of successfully fulfilling it.



Deep Experience of Advisors. We believe that our ability to leverage the experience of our Advisors, who comprise operating executives of companies across multiple sectors and industries, will provide us a distinct advantage in being able to source, evaluate and consummate an attractive transaction.
Unique Strength of Relationships with Company Founders. Our management and Advisors have been co-founders, early-stage investors and board members of companies we intend to target.





6







Proprietary Sourcing Channels and Leading Industry Relationships. We believe that the connections and capabilities of our management team, in combination with those of our Advisors, will provide us with a differentiated pipeline of acquisition opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the market to replicate. We expect these sourcing capabilities will be further bolstered by the reputation and deep industry relationships of our management team and our Advisors.
Investing and Transaction Experience. We believe that our management’s track record of identifying and sourcing transactions coupled with our Advisors’ platform that includes professionals with deep expertise across corporate strategy, investing and transaction execution positions us well to appropriately evaluate potential business combinations and select one that will be well received by the public markets.
Execution and Structuring Capability. We believe that the combined expertise and reputation of our management and our Advisors will allow us to source and complete transactions possessing structural attributes that create an attractive investment thesis. These types of transactions are typically complex and require creativity, industry knowledge and expertise, rigorous due diligence, and extensive negotiations and documentation. We believe that by focusing our investment activities on these types of transactions, we are able to generate investment opportunities that have attractive risk/reward profiles based on their valuations and structural characteristics.
Investment Criteria



We are focused on identifying companies that would benefit from becoming publicly-traded entities. We believe that our business strategy creates a compelling alternative for a growing company in a traditionally underfunded area to become a public entity and thus gain liquidity, diversify funding sources, and benefit from public market participation.



We have developed the following high-level, non-exclusive investment criteria that we will use to screen for and evaluate target businesses.



We will seek to acquire a business that have strong business fundamentals and that:



Would Benefit Uniquely from our Capabilities—a business where the collective capabilities of our management and Advisors can be leveraged to tangibly improve the operations and market position of the target.



Is Sourced Through our Proprietary Channels. We do not expect to participate in broadly marketed processes, but rather will aim to leverage our extensive network to source potential targets.



Has a Committed and Capable Management Team—a business with a professional management team whose interests are aligned with those of our investors and complement the expertise of our founders. Where necessary, we may also look to complement and enhance the capabilities of the target business’s management team by recruiting additional talent through our network of contacts.
Has the Potential to Grow Through Further Acquisition Opportunities—a business that has the platform to grow inorganically through acquisitions.



Offers an Attractive Potential Return for our Stockholders, weighing potential growth opportunities and operational improvements in the target business against any identified downside risks.



These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as on other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Form 10-K, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.





7







Our Acquisition Process



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, code reviews, security audits, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry.



Each of our directors and officers own founder shares following the completion of the initial public offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.



Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties. Subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law, none of the members of our management team who are also employed by our sponsor or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under the Delaware General Corporation Law and any other applicable fiduciary duties. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.



Initial Business Combination



NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our stockholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to stockholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.





8







We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private shares, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.



The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to redeem or repurchase shares of Class A Common Stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------




Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.



If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.



Facilities



We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 125 Townpark Drive, Suite 3000, Kennesaw, Georgia 30144. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month fee to our sponsor. We are charged for general and administrative services commencing on the date of Initial Public Offering pursuant to a letter agreement between us and our sponsor. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services, that the fee charged by our sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.

Employees



We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management may spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements



We have registered our units, Class A Common Stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and will have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.



We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  if we cease to qualify as a smaller reporting company. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



Legal Proceedings



There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
