Item 1. Business
General Development of Business
Seaboard Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Seaboard”) together comprise a diverse group of integrated companies with a broad global presence. Seaboard is primarily engaged in hog production and pork processing in the United States (“U.S.”); commodity trading and grain processing in Africa and South America; cargo shipping services in the U.S., Caribbean and Central and South America; sugar and alcohol production in Argentina; and electric power generation in the Dominican Republic. Seaboard also has an equity method investment in Butterball, LLC (“Butterball”), a producer and processor of turkey products. 
During 2020, Seaboard had unexpected leadership changes. In July 2020, Seaboard’s President, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Steven J. Bresky, passed away. The presiding Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Robert L. Steer, was appointed President, and CEO and Ellen S. Bresky, was appointed a director and Chairwoman of the Board of Directors, in each case, to fill the vacant positions previously held by Mr. Bresky. Mr. Steer continued to serve as CFO until December 2020, at which time David H. Rankin was appointed as Executive Vice President, CFO. Approximately 77% of the outstanding common stock of Seaboard is collectively owned by Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC. Ms. Bresky and other members of the Bresky family, including trusts created for their benefit, own the equity interests of Seaboard Flour LLC and SFC Preferred, LLC, which are Delaware limited liability companies. 

All of Seaboard’s segments, which provide food, transportation and power, are considered “essential businesses” as defined by the respective governments and have continued to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seaboard’s operations have been directly and indirectly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic primarily by governmental actions taken to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19 and changes in customer behavior, and there still remains uncertainty about the expected duration and severity of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on Seaboard’s operations and the global economy. Seaboard continues to promote the safety and security of all of its employees by providing masks and sanitizers, expanding cleaning, making improvements to air exchangers, promoting social distancing, and limiting travel and visitors, among many other precautions.
Description of Business
Principal Products and Services and Any Dependency
Pork Segment – Seaboard, through its subsidiary Seaboard Foods LLC, is a vertically integrated pork producer that primarily produces and sells fresh and frozen pork products to further processors, foodservice operators, distributors and grocery stores. This segment sells to U.S. customers and exports to Japan, Mexico, China and numerous other foreign markets. Seaboard raises approximately 85% of the hogs processed at its processing plant in Guymon, Oklahoma, with the remaining hog requirements purchased primarily under contracts from independent producers. Seaboard’s hog production facilities consist of genetic and commercial breeding, farrowing, nursery and finishing buildings. In November of 2020, Seaboard acquired a business, that was previously a supplier of hogs. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition.
The Pork segment also produces biodiesel at facilities in Oklahoma and Missouri. Biodiesel is produced from pork fat supplied by the Oklahoma pork processing plant and from other animal fats and vegetable oils purchased from third parties. The biodiesel is sold to fuel blenders for distribution. In 2019, the Pork segment purchased and began modifying an idle ethanol plant in Hugoton, Kansas, to produce renewable diesel with operations currently expected to begin in 2022. 

Seaboard has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Seaboard Triumph Foods, LLC (“STF”), which operates a pork processing plant located in Sioux City, Iowa. STF began single-shift operations in September 2017 and a second shift commenced in October 2018. STF’s plant is designed to process approximately six million market hogs annually when operating at full capacity. Seaboard has agreements with STF and Triumph Foods, LLC (“Triumph”), an independent pork processor, to market substantially all pork products produced at STF’s and Triumph’s pork processing plants. Seaboard and Triumph supply a portion of the hogs processed at the STF plant. Seaboard’s revenues for its pork products are primarily based on a margin sharing arrangement that considers the average sales price, standard costs and the mix of products sold from the Seaboard and Triumph pork processing plants. The Pork segment also has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Daily’s Premium Meats, LLC, which produces and markets raw and pre-cooked bacon using pork bellies sourced from Seaboard, Triumph and STF.

CT&M Segment – Seaboard’s CT&M segment, which is managed under the name of Seaboard Overseas and Trading Group, is an integrated agricultural commodity trading, processing and logistics company. Overall, the CT&M segment has facilities in 29 countries, primarily in Africa and South America. This segment sources, transports and markets

​



approximately 14 million metric tons per year of wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal and other commodities. Also, Seaboard and its affiliates produce approximately six million metric tons of wheat flour, maize meal, manufactured feed and oilseed crush commodities per year in addition to other related grain-based products. This segment owns three vessels, but the majority of the trading business is transacted with chartered ships. 
Marine Segment – Seaboard, through its subsidiary, Seaboard Marine Ltd., and various foreign affiliated companies and third-party agents, provides cargo shipping services in the U.S. and 26 countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America. The Marine segment’s primary operations are at PortMiami and include a marine terminal and an off-port warehouse for cargo consolidation and temporary storage. Seaboard also makes scheduled vessel calls in Brooklyn, Houston, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Savannah and various ports in the Caribbean and Central and South America. The Marine segment uses a network of offices and agents to sell freight services. Seaboard’s capabilities allow transport by truck or rail of import and export cargo to and from various U.S. and foreign ports. This segment’s fleet consists of approximately 21 chartered and three owned vessels, as well as dry, refrigerated and specialized containers.
Sugar and Alcohol Segment – Seaboard, through its subsidiary, Seaboard Energías Renovables y Alimentos S.R.L., operates a vertically integrated sugar and alcohol production facility in Argentina. Seaboard supplies most of the raw material processed in this facility with sugarcane grown on land that it owns. The sugar is primarily marketed locally, with some exports to other countries. The alcohol is primarily marketed to industrial users or sold as dehydrated alcohol to certain oil companies under the Argentine governmental bioethanol program, which requires alcohol to be blended with gasoline. The Sugar and Alcohol segment had two bioethanol customers that collectively represented approximately 35%-48% of its sales in each of the last three years. This segment also owns a 51-megawatt cogeneration power plant, which is fueled by the burning of sugarcane by-products, natural gas and other biomass when available.

Power Segment – Seaboard, through its subsidiary, Transcontinental Capital Corp. (Bermuda) Ltd., is an independent power producer generating electricity for the Dominican Republic power grid. Seaboard’s Power segment sells the electricity it generates primarily on the spot market to government-owned distribution companies. It is not directly involved in the transmission or distribution of electricity and is exempt from regulations under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1938, as amended. Seaboard’s Power segment owns and operates a power generating barge that contains a system of engines capable of using natural gas or heavy fuel oil to produce up to 108 megawatts of electricity. Seaboard’s Power segment is currently constructing a new floating power barge with capacity to generate approximately 146 megawatts of electricity using gaseous fuels, including natural gas. Operations are currently expected to begin by the end of 2021. Seaboard is exploring strategic alternatives for the existing barge, including selling, relocating or operating in conjunction with the new barge at the current site.
Turkey Segment – Seaboard has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Butterball, LLC (“Butterball”), a vertically integrated producer and processor of conventional, antibiotic-free and organic turkey products. Butterball is a national supplier to retail stores, foodservice outlets and industrial entities, and to a lesser extent, exports products to Mexico and other foreign markets. The Turkey segment had two retail customers that collectively represented approximately 27% of its sales in each of the last three years. 
Other Businesses – Seaboard, through its subsidiary, Mount Dora Farms Inc., processes jalapeño peppers at its plant in Honduras, which are primarily shipped to and sold in the U.S.
See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for total revenue contributed by any class of similar products or services. 





Competitive Conditions
Competition in Seaboard’s Pork segment comes from a variety of regional, national and international producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. According to the trade publications Successful Farming and Informa Economics, Seaboard was ranked number three in hog production (based on sows in production) and number four in pork processing in the U.S. in 2020 (based on daily processing capacity, including Triumph’s and STF’s capacity).
Seaboard’s CT&M segment faces competition from numerous traders around the world. Most of the grain processing and related businesses face competition from either imported products or other local producers in the same industries.
Seaboard’s Marine segment faces competition based on price, reliable sailing frequencies and customer service.

​



Seaboard’s Sugar and Alcohol segment owns one of the largest sugar mills in Argentina and faces significant competition for sugar sales in the local Argentine market. Sugar and alcohol prices in Argentina can fluctuate compared to world markets due to Argentine government price controls and protection policies. 
Seaboard’s Power segment sells the power it generates to the spot market or to contract customers at prices based on market conditions and cost-based rates. The Dominican government sets a cap on the electricity spot market prices and establishes the dispatch order of who sells into the power grid. To sell to the power grid, Seaboard competes with producers utilizing various types of fuel and generation technologies, including hydro, solar, wind, natural gas, heavy fuel oil or coal. Producers who have lower variable costs to operate may receive dispatch preference from the Dominican government. The new power barge is expected to be more efficient than Seaboard’s dual-fueled barge due to the latest technologies and use of gas turbines instead of engines.
Competition for the Turkey segment comes from a variety of regional and national producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. 
Resources Material to Business
The Power segment and Turkey segment utilize material amounts of raw materials that are dependent on purchases from one supplier or a small group of dominant suppliers. The Power segment has one primary supplier of natural gas, but the existing barge can run on other types of fuel. The Turkey segment purchases a significant portion of its feed and grain used in the manufacturing of feed for its turkeys in North Carolina from Seaboard’s 50% partner in Butterball.
Also, Seaboard believes there is significant recognition of the trademarks identified below in the various industries Seaboard serves and by many of its customers. The Pork segment uses registered trademarks including, but not limited to, Seaboard Foods®, Seaboard Farms®, Seaboard EnergyTM, Prairie Fresh®, Prairie Fresh USA Prime®, Our Farms, Our Commitment®, St. Joe Pork®, and Cook-in Bag®. The CT&M segment uses registered trademarks including, but not limited to, Mothers Pride® and Zambia’s Pride® in Zambia, Thunderbolt Flour® and Maid Marian® in Guyana, GMA® and Top Pain® in Ivory Coast, and GMD® and Jarga® in Senegal. The Marine segment uses the registered trademarks of Seaboard Marine® and Seaboard Solutions®. The Sugar and Alcohol segment markets sugar under the Chango® brand. The Turkey segment uses registered trademarks including, but not limited to, Butterball®, Carolina Turkey® and Farm to Family Butterball®. While Seaboard considers all of its intellectual and proprietary rights important, Seaboard believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license or other intellectual property right.
Seasonal Business
The Turkey business is seasonal for whole birds and related products with the holiday season driving the majority of those sales. Seaboard’s other segments are not seasonally dependent to any material extent.

Governmental Regulations
Environmental Matters
Seaboard’s Pork segment and Turkey segment are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment that require the expenditure of funds in the ordinary course of business. Seaboard’s Pork and Turkey segments do not anticipate making expenditures for these purposes that, in the aggregate, would have a material effect on Seaboard’s financial condition or results of operations. Also, Seaboard’s Marine and CT&M segments’ vessels are subject to environment regulations related to global sulfur emissions requirements.
Other Regulations
As a company with global operations, Seaboard is subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations and anti-bribery and corruption laws. Seaboard has policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, Seaboard’s compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material effect on Seaboard’s financial condition or results of operations. Governmental regulations are subject to change, and accordingly, Seaboard is unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether compliance with such regulations will materially impact Seaboard’s business in the future.
Human Capital Resources
Employees are critical to the operation of all Seaboard’s essential businesses and Seaboard is committed to the safety and wellbeing of all employees. Seaboard’s human capital management strategies include a focus on the following areas: (i) physical wellness – Seaboard offers competitive healthcare benefits, including wellness and employee assistance programs; (ii) financial wellness – Seaboard offers competitive compensation and bonus packages, as well as life and

disability insurance benefits; (iii) work/life wellness – Seaboard provides paid time off and paid holidays, as well as professional development opportunities and support, including tuition reimbursement programs; (iv) community wellness – Seaboard believes in supporting the communities in which it operates and provides matching gift programs, volunteer time off and sponsors charitable activities and events; and (v) additional benefits – Seaboard provides other benefits designed to engage and retain employees, including hosting employee events designed to maintain morale and foster teamwork and providing an employee meat purchase program at wholesale prices. Seaboard also recognizes that diversity is the key to its successful operations and seeks to design human capital management strategies to meet the diverse needs of its employees.

As of December 31, 2020, Seaboard had approximately 13,100 employees, of whom approximately 6,600 were in the U.S. Of Seaboard’s total U.S. employees, approximately 83% were Pork segment employees. Substantially all of Seaboard’s Pork segment’s hourly employees at its processing plant are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in 2024. The Pork segment has had challenges recruiting and retaining employees due to the remote locations, restrictive domestic policies on immigration and unique operating environments, among other factors. Currently between 30% and 60% of the Pork segment’s workforce is dependent upon employment visas in different production areas.
Internationally, Seaboard operates facilities globally, including in developing countries, where at times, inherent challenges associated with safety and political stability may exist, primarily in the CT&M segment. The CT&M segment is dependent on identifying and retaining qualified expatriate personnel at many of its locations. Recruiting and developing talent in these locations remains a priority for this segment.
