ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Max Sound Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 9, 2005 as 43010, Inc. to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, locating and negotiating with a business entity for combination in the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. On October 7, 2008, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, Mr. Greg Halpern purchased a total of 100,000 shares of our common stock from Michael Raleigh for an aggregate of $30,000 in cash. As part of the acquisition, and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement,

Raleigh, resigned from all the key executive positions he held in the company, and Mr. Halpern was appointed as our President, CEO, CFO and Chairman. The original business model was developed by Mr. Halpern from October 2008 until January 2011, which focused on developing an Internet search engine and social networking web site launched in January of 2010 featuring an outstanding endorsement and web based commercial by William Shatner for stock warrants.
 

Better capitalized, Silicon Valley, Venture-funded companies crowding the same space with more advanced products, caused the Company to diversify on May 11, 2010, when it acquired the worldwide rights, title and interest to all fields of use for MAX-D HD Audio Technology to which our current website https://www.maxd.audio/showcases, what finally in 2021, is living up to its original vision as major breakthrough technology. 
 
On March 8, 2011, the Company changed its name to Max Sound Corporation and its trading symbol on the OTC Bulletin Board to MAXD.
 
MAX-D is to Audio what High Definition is to Video and today it works by delivering the best-in-class consumer audio experience rivaling any existing product available to listeners globally. Remarkably, MAX-D accomplishes its auditory miracle without increasing file size and saves on bandwidth usage and cost in the process.
 
In Q2 of 2014, MAXD announced that it had acquired the license and representation rights to VSL’s patented video and data technology known as “Optimized Data Transmission System and Method” (ODT) which enables end-user licensees to transport 100% of data bandwidth content in only 3% of the bandwidth with the identical lossless quality. Significantly, this represented a 33 times reduction associated with transport cost and the time it takes for the video or digital content to be delivered to and viewed by the end-user.
 
Also, in Q2 of 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive rights to sue violators of Eli Attia’s intellectual property rights. While Eli Attia was teaching his invention at Google [x], the project was internally valued by Google at $120 Billion USD a year in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry to which Attia has been a leader for half a century.
 
The Racketeering (RICO) version of the case has been spearheaded by John E. Floyd, the leading authority on RICO in all fifty states and the protégé of G. Robert Blakey, the creator of the original RICO statute and the co-author of the Attia’s initial RICO suit against Google and the founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin as well as Google X CEO Astro Teller, Sebastian Thrun, and Flux Factory with its falsely claimed co-inventors Nicholas Chim, Jennifer Carlile, Michelle Kaufmann, Augusto Roman and Astro Teller. In the appealed RICO opening brief, Floyd makes the following points as part of his argument -
 
“The district court misapplied the law in each of its rulings. The court’s statutory standing finding was premised on an unduly restrictive reading of the DTSA and 18 U.S.C. § 1832 that actually protects—indeed, rewards—the most egregious trade secret mis-appropriators — those who, like Google, steal and then extinguish trade secrets altogether by wrongfully publishing them. Neither the DTSA nor § 1832, however, can be construed in such a self-defeating manner. And in any event, Google and Flux are equitably estopped from invoking Google’s wrongful publication of Plaintiffs’ trade secrets to evade liability under either the DTSA or RICO.”
 

In October 2019, the Federal Circuit ruled that the Inter Partes Review (IPR) Judges at the Patent Trademark and Appeals Board (PTAB) were not qualified under the United States Constitution, so therefore Googles impairment of the ‘339 ODT Patent was illegal in the process Max Sound’s Chairman Halpern has been calling “criminal theft of legitimate American Small Business Inventors under the license for big Corporations to steal known as America Invents Act.”

-

To further clarify MAXD’s current role in the Attia and ODT legal matters described above, the Company is not a party to any of these legal cases that it has an interest in and the potential to profit from in the future. The Company has brought together IP rights holders since 2014 with both Contingency Law Firms and Litigation Financed Law Firms to create the enforcement of Intellectual Property rights holders with cases currently addressing Patent Infringement, Trade Secret Theft, Breach of Contract and Racketeering (“RICO”). MAXD has secured the potential to profit therefrom, as the power of attorney, to negotiate and approve a final financial deal with Google on behalf of the rights holders as either settlements or licensing arrangements both of which have been in and out of negotiations for the past six years. Halpern recently was quoted, "There are many more cases that will be filed against Anti-trust Monopoly Google for its bad-business-practices for the past decade ultimately going forward until they change their worst-in-class, anti-American approach to inventors. Samsung recently called them the most dishonest company in history. Eight years ago, Google never had heard of little MAX-D. Now, they wish they'd never heard of us. Next up is a few trillion dollars more of exposure to theft where the courts have just looked the other way. While we are finally able to build our business successfully around Google's premeditated thefts, their judicial manipulation and total lack of any ethical standard, MAX-D will never bow down until Google is forced to pay."
 
Description of Our Business
 
After years of R & D and business development that pushed and pulled the company and its HD Audio and Biometric Security technologies in many directions, MAX-D has finally become an important player to several major industries, requiring the best-in-class solutions it offers.
 As subsequent events all this month of March, MAXD has signed three actual revenue events that create a standard for licensing going forward as follows - MAX-D receives at least 6 figures of upfront money, at least 7 figures over ten years to maintain exclusivity in specific industry or geographical categories, and finally the clear potential for up to 8 figures of residuals from related joint revenue sharing opportunities.
 Thanks now to the massive value growth and popularity of Tesla Motors, the Hende Moto Signed License Agreement, has opened up a host of other incoming offers to license from Electric and Hybrid vehicles in several major countries that are in fast moving negotiations at this time. The sudden positive demand for MAX-D, clearly illustrates that it can provide an immediate competitive market advantage over virtually any other brand solution, while simultaneously co-existing as a tremendous complimentary addition to any other popular brand already imbedded in existing hardware and software in the Audio Categories that MAX-D will effortlessly compete in going forward. 
Max Sound (MAX-D) has finally arrived at the on-time moment in history where it has an endless audience of licensing opportunities resulting in newly closed deals that assure MAX-D - at least 6 figures in up front money, 7 figures over ten years and 8 figures of projectable revenue share residuals.
 
Qualcomm - MAX-D Mobile Voice
 
The Company is currently working under its existing license with Qualcomm offering software code for 600 series Snap Dragon chips. MAX-D Mobile Voice provides clean, intelligible voice call over a standard mobile line without increasing file size and it eliminates the need for special codecs.
MAX-D Mobile Voice -
 
• | Does not require “special” hardware in order to work. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Can be implemented into ANY Mobile voice application. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Works on Any Mobile platforms without extra bandwidth use 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Can be immediately applied in any cell phone dsp. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Is a dynamic process that adjusts itself according to the use or the needs of the user 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(1.) Test voice enters
 (2.) the ANALYZE VOICE module where the harmonic and amplitude of the voice are analyzed for content.
 (3.)This analyzing will produce a harmonic and dynamic map in the DETERMINE HARMONIC AND AMPLITUDE module to drive the next module.
 (4.) A new voice will be generated using the GENERATE ENHANCED VOICE module. This module will compare the original voice with a model that has been optimized for harmonic and dynamic ranges and apply the difference of the two to create an entirely new voice that has been optimized for clarity in the host device.
 (5.) The ENHANCED VOICE OUTPUT will be output to the host device.
 MAX-D Mobile Voice
 
There is a consumer driven need to improve accuracy & quality of Mobile voice audio.
 The Problem - 
 Cell phone electronics commonly have a very limited frequency range. This results in anything from degraded to garbled hearing on the receiving device. The voice recognition engines in devices are very DSP intensive. Usually, to

3
-

implement a better quality one requires more DSP powering the device, or you can add the Max Sound process and increase the productivity of the existing one.
 
The Solution-
 By applying the MAX-D VOICE ENHANCEMENT to this audio it becomes much clearer and easier to discern the voice you are listening to. This process is a digital process meant to be used in the DSP of a device. It can be used on both inbound and outbound calls for improvement of both. On the outbound call, the device receiving the call will receive better than “normal” audio quality because of the process.
 
As the process increase the intelligibility of the audio, it provides the existing voice recognition engine with processed audio of much greater intelligibility than without. Thus allowing the existing engine to function with a higher degree of accuracy at a lower DSP cost than totally replacing it.
 
Summary of the Invention
 1.       A computer implemented method for enhancing processed voice comprising:
 a.       receiving voice audio; and
 b.       enhancing the voice audio in several harmonic and dynamic ranges.
 2.       The computer implemented method of embodiment 1, wherein the audio is enhanced by resynthesizing it into full range PCM wave.
 3.       The computer implemented method of embodiment 1 or 2, wherein the received mobile voice audio is in compressed format.
 4.       The computer implemented method of any one of embodiments 1-3, wherein the voice audio is from an inbound mobile call.
 5.       The computer implemented method of any one of embodiments 1-3, wherein the voice audio is from an outbound mobile call.
 
Detailed Description of the Invention
 MAX-D Mobile Voice process is used to help clarify both inbound and outbound voice on a Mobile Device. This is accomplished by restoring (resynthesizing) the Mobile Device audio to a much greater harmonic and dynamic range than the original.
 
Inbound:
 The user talks into the device, where it goes into the MAX-D Mobile Voice enhancement module. There, the harmonic and dynamic properties are resynthesized into a full range PCM (Pulse-code modulation) wave with extended audio content. Therefore, it has much more clarity to work from instead of the compressed, band limited audio available in the existing cell audio.
Outbound:
 The user speaks into the device's microphone and the result is much clearer, more real sounding wave that is transmitted to the call receiver.  The transmitted wave retains much of the quality of the original voice, even though it has to be compressed by the cell phone system.

Optimized Data Transmission (ODT)
 
In November 2016, MAX-D entered into an agreement with Vedanti Licensing Limited (VLL), and become co-owners of the ODT patents and technology.


About MAX-D HD Audio:
 
The MAX-D software improves the sound heard from any device. Consumers have unknowingly sacrificed better audio quality for portable convenience and MAX-D rectifies this problem by: analyzing what content is missing from the compressed audio signal; dynamically resynthesizing lost harmonics and natural sound fields in real time; maximizing the output potential of any device without increasing original file size; and without requiring consumers or OEM’s to change equipment or infrastructure.
 

MAX-D Benefits: Increases dynamic range, eliminates destructive effects of audio compression with no increase in file size or transmission bandwidth; High-resolution audio reproduction with an omni-directional sound field using only two speakers; “Real” three-dimensional sound field, versus artificial sound field created by competing technologies; and More realistic “live performance” quality of all recordings with optimal dynamic range, bass response and overall clarity.

MAX-D Technology
 
MAX-D is a unique approach to processing sound, based on the physics of acoustics rather than electronics. Remarkably simple to deploy, MAX-D is a technology that dramatically raises the standard for sound quality, with no corresponding increase in file size or transmission channel bandwidth. This is accomplished by processing audio with our proprietary, patent-pending process. This embedded and duplicating format either remains the same or can be converted to whatever format the user desires, while retaining unparalleled fidelity and dynamic range. MAX-D restores the original recorded acoustical space in any listening environment. MAX-D is the only technology that both aligns phase and corrects phase distortion in a completed recording. MAX-D supplies missing audio content by adding acoustics and frequency response lost in the original recording or in the compression and transmission processes. MAX-D corrects and optimizes harmonic content and low frequency responses, greatly enhancing acoustic accuracy and we believe reduces ear fatigue. MAX-D integrates time, phase, harmonics, dynamics, and sub-harmonic region

optimizations in a fully dynamic fashion. MAX-D is a lossless dynamic process, requiring no destructive encoding/decoding process, or any specialized decoder at all. MAX-D needs no additional hardware or critical monitoring stage after processing. The end result is that every aspect of audio processed with MAX-D - voice, instrument, or special effects - sounds refreshingly clear, realistic, and natural. The MAX-D HD Audio Technology creates an optimum sound field throughout every listening environment – from the corners of a theater; on your living room couch; to the back seat of your car. MAX-D HD Audio Technology requires no equipment changeover and can be embedded into any product (e.g. speakers, headphones, mobile devices), or online content delivery systems (e.g. streaming, cable, video games) to provide better sounding audio.
 
Market
 
MAX-D products and services are designed and intended to add high-definition quality and cost-savings to audio components and delivery of several separate industries, including consumer electronics, motion picture, broadcasting, video game, recording, mobile phone, internet, and VOIP applications.
Competition
 
The Company’s management believes there are no current direct competitors capable of delivering as high quality of audio technology as its MAXD HD Audio. Although other companies, like DTS or Dolby, have technologies that enhance sound; we do not believe these technologies negatively affect the Company because the MAX-D process can enhance the other audio company’s technology.
 
We believe we will be considered friendly competition in the future for three reasons; (1) we believe that MAX-D technology delivers the best sound quality available today, (2) MAX-D does not require any additional equipment; and (3) MAX-D makes any competition’s audio processes sound better.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Max-D and HD Audio technologies and designs are Patented, Patents Pending and Trademarked. The Company currently owns Patent No. 9300262, Audio Processing Application for Windows, which was published on November 12, 2015 and then unlawfully assigned to Adli Law Group.
