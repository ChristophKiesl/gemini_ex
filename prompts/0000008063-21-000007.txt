ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Astronics Corporation (“Astronics” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of advanced technologies to the global aerospace, defense and other mission-critical industries. Our products and services include advanced, high-performance electrical power generation, distribution and seat motion systems, lighting and safety systems, avionics products, systems and certification, aircraft structures and automated test systems.
We have principal operations in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, France and England, as well as engineering offices in the Ukraine and India.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) surfaced in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to other countries, including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments and other measures. As a result, global demand for travel declined at a rapid pace and has remained depressed. The exact timing and pace of a recovery is indeterminable as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since experienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, while others, particularly international markets, remain closed or are enforcing extended quarantines. 
The commercial aerospace industry, in particular, has been significantly disrupted, both domestically and internationally. The pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on our business in 2020. The impact of COVID-19 is fluid and continues to evolve, and the shape and speed of recovery for the commercial aerospace industry remains uncertain. We currently expect it may take up to three years or more for travel to return to 2019 levels. There is significant uncertainty with respect to when the commercial transport market, the largest market we serve, will recover, and whether and at what point capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels.
We took immediate and aggressive action to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces and reduce costs. Since the early days of the pandemic, we have been following guidance from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) to protect employees and prevent the spread of the virus within all of our facilities globally. Some of the actions implemented include: social distancing; appropriate personal protective equipment; facility deep cleaning; flexible work-from-home scheduling; pre-shift temperature screenings, where allowed by law; and restrictions on facility visitors and unnecessary travel. Material actions to reduce costs included: (1) reducing our workforce to align operations with customer demand; (2) suspension of certain benefit programs; and (3) delaying non-essential capital projects and minimizing discretionary spending. At the same time, we addressed the ongoing needs of our business to continue to serve our customers. Additionally, Astronics has pursued business opportunities from other markets, taking advantage of its technical design expertise and manufacturing capabilities, which are currently underutilized. These opportunities can be meaningful, and some are directly related to the fight against COVID-19. We also executed an amendment to our credit agreement, as more fully described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8, Long-Term Debt in this report. 
Acquisitions
On July 1, 2019, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Freedom Communication Technologies, Inc. (“Freedom”). Freedom, located in Kilgore, Texas, is a leader in wireless communication testing, primarily for the civil land mobile radio market. Freedom is included in our Test Systems segment. The total consideration for the transaction was $21.8 million, net of $0.6 million in cash acquired. 
On October 4, 2019, the Company acquired the stock of the primary operating subsidiaries as well as certain other assets from mass transit and defense market test solution provider, Diagnosys Test Systems Limited, for $7.0 million in cash, plus contingent purchase consideration (“earnout”) estimated at a fair value of $2.5 million at acquisition. Diagnosys Inc. and its affiliates (“Diagnosys”) is included in our Test Systems segment. Diagnosys is a developer and manufacturer of comprehensive automated test equipment providing test, support, and repair of high value electronics, electro-mechanical, pneumatic and printed circuit boards focused on the global mass transit and defense markets. The terms of the acquisition allow for a potential earnout of up to an additional $13.0 million over the three years post-acquisition based on achievement of new order levels of over $72.0 million during that period. No earnout was payable for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2020. The acquired business has operations in Westford, Massachusetts as well as Ferndown, England, and an engineering center of excellence in Bangalore, India. 
Divestitures
On February 13, 2019, the Company completed a divestiture of its semiconductor test business within the Test Systems segment. The business was not core to the future of the Test Systems segment. The total proceeds of the divestiture amounted to $103.8 million. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $80.1 million in the first quarter of 2019. The Company recorded income tax expense relating to the gain of $19.7 million.
The transaction also includes two elements of contingent earnouts. The “First Earnout” is calculated based on a multiple of all future sales of existing and certain future derivative products to existing and future customers in each annual period from 2019 through 2022. The First Earnout may not exceed $35.0 million in total. The “Second Earnout” is calculated based on a multiple of future sales related to an existing product and program with an existing customer exceeding an annual threshold for each annual period from 2019 through 2022. The Second Earnout is not capped. For the Second Earnout, if the applicable sales in an annual period do not exceed the annual threshold, no amounts will be paid relative to such annual period; the sales in such annual period do not carry over to the next annual period. Due to the degree of uncertainty associated with estimating the future sales levels of the divested business and its underlying programs, and the lack of reliable predictive market information, the Company has elected an accounting policy to recognize such earnout proceeds, if received, as additional gain on sale when such proceeds are realized or realizable. We consider the proceeds realizable when we have received communication from the purchaser of its calculation of the earnout and the parties reach agreement on the calculation. No amounts were payable to the Company under either earnout for the year ended December 31, 2019. On February 13, 2021, the Company was notified by the purchaser that they have calculated $10.7 million as being payable to the Company under the First and Second Earnouts for the year ended December 31, 2020. There is a period by which we and the purchaser will review the earnout calculation, which is underway. Upon completion of the review and agreement of any adjustments, the Company expects to record the additional gain on the sale in the first quarter of 2021.
On July 12, 2019, the Company sold intellectual property and certain assets associated with its Airfield Lighting product line for $1.0 million in cash. The Airfield Lighting product line, part of the Aerospace segment, was not core to the business and represented less than 1% of revenue. The Company recorded a pre-tax loss on the sale of approximately $1.3 million.
Products and Customers
Our Aerospace segment designs and manufactures products for the global aerospace industry. Product lines include lighting and safety systems, electrical power generation, distribution and motions systems, aircraft structures, avionics products, systems certification, and other products. Our Aerospace customers are the airframe manufacturers (“OEM”) that build aircraft for the commercial, military and general aviation markets, suppliers to those OEM’s, aircraft operators such as airlines, suppliers to the aircraft operators, and branches of the U.S. Department of Defense. During 2020, this segment’s sales were divided 64% to the commercial transport market, 16% to the military aircraft market, 14% to the business jet market and 6% to other markets. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse impact on air travel worldwide, the commercial aerospace industry has been significantly disrupted. The significant adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial transport market channels has led to this market comprising a lower percentage of our net sales in fiscal 2020 than typical. Most of this segment’s sales are a result of contracts or purchase orders received from customers, placed on a day-to-day basis or for single year procurements rather than long-term multi-year contract commitments. On occasion, the Company does receive contractual commitments or blanket purchase orders from our customers covering multiple-year deliveries of hardware to our customers.
Our Test Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures and maintains automated test systems that support the aerospace and defense, communications and mass transit industries as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and military applications. In the Test Systems segment, Astronics’ products are sold to a global customer base including OEM's and prime government contractors for both electronics and military products. The nature of our Test Systems business is such that it pursues large, often multi-year, projects.
Sales by segment, geographic region, major customer and foreign operations are provided in Note 20 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this report.
We have a significant concentration of business with two major customers; Panasonic Avionics Corporation (“Panasonic”) and The Boeing Company (“Boeing”). Sales to Panasonic accounted for 11.1% of sales in 2020, 13.0% of sales in 2019, and 14.4% of sales in 2018. Sales to Boeing accounted for 9.5% of sales in 2020, 13.6% of sales in 2019, and 14.3% of sales in 2018. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to increase our value by developing technologies and capabilities either internally or through acquisition, and use those capabilities to provide innovative solutions to the aerospace and defense and other markets where our technology can be beneficial.
Practices as to Maintaining Working Capital
Liquidity is discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report.
Competitive Conditions
We experience considerable competition in the market sectors we serve, principally with respect to product performance and price, from various competitors, many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources. Success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation, customer support, responsiveness and cost management. We continue to invest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our markets.
Government Contracts
All U.S. government contracts, including subcontracts where the U.S. government is the ultimate customer, may be subject to termination at the election of the government. Our revenue stream relies on military spending. Approximately 16% of our consolidated sales were made to the military aircraft and military test systems markets combined.
Raw Materials
Materials, supplies and components are purchased from numerous sources. We believe that the loss of any one source, although potentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term.
Seasonality
Our business is typically not seasonal.
Backlog
At December 31, 2020, our consolidated backlog was $283.4 million. At December 31, 2019, our backlog was $359.6 million. The decrease in backlog is attributable to the adverse impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on customer demand, particularly our commercial aerospace and business jet customers, domestically and internationally. The uncertainty of the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the aerospace industry is expected to continue to inhibit sales order backlog growth in the commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket channels until OEM build rates increase and commercial airlines increase spending on fleet improvements.
Backlog in the Aerospace segment was $191.1 million at December 31, 2020, of which $162.8 million is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2021. Backlog in the Test Systems segment was $92.3 million at December 31, 2020. The Test Systems segment expects to recognize as revenue $54.1 million of backlog in 2021. 
Patents
We have a number of patents. While the aggregate protection of these patents is of value, our only material business that is dependent upon the protection afforded by these patents is our cabin power distribution products. Our patents and patent applications relate to electroluminescence, instrument panels, cord reels and handsets, and a broad patent covering the cabin power distribution technology. We regard our expertise and techniques as proprietary and rely upon trade secret laws and contractual arrangements to protect our rights. We have trademark protection in our major markets.
Research, Development and Engineering Activities
We are engaged in a variety of engineering and design activities as well as basic research and development activities directed to the substantial improvement or new application of our existing technologies. These costs are expensed when incurred and included in cost of products sold. Research, development and engineering costs amounted to approximately $86.8 million in 2020, $108.9 million in 2019 and $114.3 million in 2018.
Human Capital Resources
Human Capital Management and Corporate Culture
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,200 employees, of whom approximately 1,800 were employed in the United States and approximately 400 were employed outside of the United States. We have approximately 60 hourly production employees at PECO who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs.
We greatly value our employees and recognize that, without them, the Company would not have achieved the success it has accomplished since inception. We strive to provide a positive, supportive work culture with a clear global vision and a collaborative work style. We strongly believe that a focus on learning and supporting career development can lead to success. With low attrition and high referral rates, Astronics Corporation regularly earns “best employer” awards. 
As it relates to customers, investors, suppliers and partners, our Company is dedicated to conducting business with integrity and responsibility for the greater good. We promote honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable government regulations and accountability by all of its directors, officers and employees.
When considering an acquisition or partnership, we embed questions specific to human capital management within our due diligence approach. These questions are in the areas of culture, equal employment opportunity, compliance with governing bodies, ethics, as well as employee benefits. We ask these in an effort to ensure that the acquisition candidate is a positive cultural fit and to minimize any risk when assessing the acquisition candidate.
In addition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines outline expectations that the Board establish and promote policies that encourage a positive, supportive work culture. The Board recognizes that culture is critical to the long-term success of Astronics and our strategy.
Compensation Programs and Employee Benefits
We believe that future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including;
•Health and dental insurance
•Generous paid time off
•401(k), profit sharing, and bonus programs
•Flexible spending accounts
•Employee stock purchase plan
•Disability and life insurance
•Commute reduction, fitness, tuition programs
•Community service opportunities
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a sudden and significant impact on the global economy, and particularly in the aerospace industry, causing us to make difficult cost conservation measures including workforce reductions activities to align capacity with expected demand as well as suspension of certain benefit programs. These measures were taken to maintain the financial health and liquidity of the business. We are continuously evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the its impact on the global economy and the aerospace industry, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. We will continue to strive to return to a normal level of employment opportunity and benefit offering for the valued employees of Astronics.
Employee Engagement 
The lifeblood of any organization is its employee base. We rely on our individual subsidiaries to regularly gather employee feedback, using the method each subsidiary believes is most appropriate. In some instances that feedback is obtained through “Town Hall” formats; in other instances, it is obtained through surveys. We also expect our managers to solicit and, where applicable, use employee feedback to improve its business practices and working environment. We are proud to have received numerous awards, recognizing both product quality as well as the ability to provide an excellent work environment.
Diversity and Inclusion 
Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We believe that diversity and inclusion is critical for the attraction and retention of top talent. We employ policies and procedures to recruit women and minority talent as well as policies to ensure pay equality. Astronics has an Equal Employment Opportunity Policy whereby we commit to providing equal employment opportunity for all qualified employees and applicants.
Health and Safety
Astronics is committed to the safety of our customers and our employees. Each Astronics operation maintains environmental, health and safety policies that seek to promote the operation of its businesses in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of the public and its employees, particularly in the response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented actions to maintain the health of our employees including social distancing measures, the use of masks, restricting visitors and unnecessary travel, and working from home whenever possible.
Our operations offer several health and welfare programs to employees to promote fitness and wellness and to encourage preventative healthcare. In addition, our employees are offered a confidential employee assistance program that provides professional counseling to employees and their family members. Also, many of our operations offer green space for employees to use during their breaks.
