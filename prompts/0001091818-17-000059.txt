Plan of Operations
 
Insynergy Products was a company with experience in commercializing consumer products through commercial and infomercial production development. The corporate goal was to develop intellectual property (IP) internally or via a license from a third party; however, due to the inability to raise funds the Company has abandoned this strategy. The Board of Directors is cognizant of the Companys limitations. The Company currently has no revenue from current operations, with liabilities exceeding its assets. Management is analyzing new potential growth paths and the potential for a restructuring; however, there is still substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
 
The Company is currently performing its due diligence for a corporate reorganization. This due diligence phase, involving counsel and other qualified professionals is necessary in order to cautiously explore appropriate steps to restructure the Company for the purposes of executing a new business model within the Companys core competencies.  
  The Company has taken some preliminary steps in executing this vision; however, there are several hurdles the Company expects to encounter that may prevent this reorganization from coming to fruition. 
 
The reorganization may include restructuring the Companys capital structure and a change or evolution in the Company's business model. This potential reorganization may also include consummating new strategic relationships in manufacturing, marketing and sales and may also include licensing existing brands. Through these potential new partnerships, the Company intends to explore the commercialization of key products that may have a competitive advantage in the consumer products space. In the event of this potential reorganization, the Company is in discussions with new personnel that may become part of the senior management to assist the Company going forward. 
  If this reorganization occurs the projected timeline is for the reorganization to occur during the first half of 2017 and would include a change in name. Although the strategy is evolving, the Companys goals are to again become a cutting-edge supplier in the consumer market place with the ultimate goal of increasing shareholder value. 
 
The Company will continue to evaluate this and other opportunities to further set its strategy for 2017 and 2018.
