Our Company 
 We are a leading home and security products company that competes in attractive long-term growth markets in our product categories. With a foundation of market-leading brands across a diversified mix of channels, and lean and flexible supply chains, as well as a tradition of strong product innovation and customer service, we are focused on outperforming our markets in both growth and returns, and driving increased shareholder value. We have four business segments: Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors and Security. We sell our products through a wide array of sales channels, including kitchen and bath dealers, wholesalers oriented toward builders or professional remodelers, industrial and locksmith distributors, do-it-yourself remodeling-oriented home centers and other retail outlets. We believe the Companys impressive track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of our categories and our leading brands. Our performance in the five years since becoming an independent publicly traded company demonstrates the strength of our operating model and our ability to generate profitable growth as sales volume increases and we leverage our structural competitive advantages to gain share in our categories. In 2016, we celebrated our five-year anniversary as an independent company and we were added to the S&P 500 Index. 
Our Strategy 
 Build on leading business and brand positions in attractive growth and return categories.    We believe that we have leading market positions and brands in many of our product categories. We continue to plan to invest in targeted advertising and other strategic initiatives aimed 
 
1 
 
 at enhancing brand awareness and educating consumers regarding the breadth, features and benefits of our product lines. For example, in the third quarter of 2016, Moen launched its new Buy it for  advertising campaign. We also strive to leverage our brands by expanding into adjacent product categories and continue to develop new programs by working closely with our customers. 
 Continue to develop innovative products for customers, designers, installers and consumers.    Sustained investments in consumer-driven product innovation and customer service, along with our low cost structures, have contributed to our success in the marketplace and creating consumer demand. In 2016, MasterBrand Cabinets which provides a wide range of cabinets for the home, launched innovative new cabinet door designs, color palettes and features in a range of styles that allows consumers to create a custom kitchen look at an affordable price and introduced new, exclusive laminate door and finish options across multiple price segments. We continue to provide channel support with responsive websites featuring our cabinet brands that drives consumer leads to our partner dealers. In 2016, we created the Global Plumbing Group (GPG), a strategic platform designed to accelerate growth opportunities and transform our existing plumbing business. We expanded our brand presence in plumbing through the acquisition of Riobel Inc. (Riobel), a Canadian premium showroom brand. We also acquired ROHL LLC (ROHL), a California-based luxury brand and in a related transaction, we acquired TCL Manufacturing Ltd, which gave us ownership of Perrin & Rowe Limited (Perrin & Rowe), a UK manufacturer and designer of luxury kitchen and bathroom plumbing products. In addition, GPGs legacy brand, Moen had a number of innovative product launches in 2016, including a customizable shower technology with personal device integration. The Therma-Tru portfolio of on-trend door and glass collections continued to evolve to meet current and emerging architectural design trends including wider and taller door styles, expanding panel configurations, as well as additional decorative, privacy and textured glass designs. Master Lock continued to be an innovation leader in security and safety products and services, driven by consumer and end user focused insights with continued emphasis on electronic enabled solutions for enhanced capability and convenience. In 2016, Master Lock launched new products including stainless steel padlocks, resettable combination outdoor locks and lock boxes; all of which deliver improved weather protection, enhanced security, and improved ease of use for end users. SentrySafe continued to provide a full line portfolio of quality security, fire and water resistant safes to help consumers and small business owners protect documents and valuables. 
 Expand in international markets.    We expect to have opportunities to expand sales by further penetrating international markets, which represented approximately 15% of net sales in 2016. We continue to develop our relationship with dealers and distributors and their Moen branded stores throughout China. In our Cabinets segment, Kitchen Craft remained a leading cabinetry brand in Canada in 2016, while WoodCrafters provided a company presence in Mexico. Master Lock continued to expand its presence in Europe and Asia (primarily Japan), while Therma-Tru made inroads in Canada as consumers transitioned from traditional entry door materials to more advanced and energy-efficient fiberglass doors. 
 Leverage our global supply chains.    We are using lean manufacturing, design-to-manufacture and distributive assembly techniques to make our supply chains more flexible and improve supply chain quality, cost, response times and asset efficiency. We view our supply chains as a strategic asset not only to support strong operating leverage as volumes increase, but also to enable the profitable growth of new products, adjacent market expansion and international growth. We invested in innovative supply chain initiatives, including entering into a joint venture agreement to operate a manufacturing facility in China. 
 Enhance returns and deploy our cash flow to high-return opportunities.    We continue to believe our most attractive opportunities are to invest in profitable organic growth initiatives, pursue accretive strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, and return cash to shareholders through a 
 
2 
 
 combination of dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. Both add-on acquisitions and share repurchase opportunities may be particularly attractive in the next few years. In 2016, we took a number of steps to position ourselves for the future by creating GPG, completing acquisitions under GPG, amending and restating our credit agreement to combine and rollover the existing revolving credit facility and term loan into a new standalone $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, completing the integration of our Norcraft Companies, Inc. (Norcraft) business, investing in capacity, strategically repurchasing our shares and increasing the quarterly cash dividend by 13% to $0.18 per share of our common stock. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe our competitive strengths include the following: 
 Leading brands.    We have leading brands in many of our product categories. We believe that established brands are meaningful to both consumers and trade customers in their respective categories and that we have the opportunity to, among other things, continue to expand many of our brands into adjacent product categories and international markets. 
 Strategic focus on attractive consumer-facing categories.    We believe we operate in categories that, while very competitive, are among the more attractive categories in the home products and security products markets. Some of the key characteristics that make these categories attractive in our view include the following: 

> | product quality, innovation, fashion, finish, durability and functionality, which are key determinants of product selection in addition to price;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | established brands, which are meaningful to both consumers and trade customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | the opportunity to add value to a complex consumer purchasing decision with excellent service propositions, reliability of products, ease of installation and superior delivery lead times;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | the value our products add to a home, particularly with kitchen and bath remodeling and additions, and the curb appeal offered by stylish entry door systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | favorable long-term trends in household formations that benefit the outlook for our markets over time;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


> | the relatively stable demand for plumbing and security products; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


> | the opportunity to expand into adjacent categories.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 Operational excellence.    We believe our investments in lean manufacturing and productivity initiatives have resulted in supply chain flexibility and the ability to cost-effectively add or reduce capacity in order to match demand levels. In 2016, we invested in incremental capacity to support long-term growth potential both in the U.S. and international markets. In addition, our supply chains and low cost structures have created favorable operating leverage allowing volumes to grow without sacrificing customer service levels. We believe that margin improvement will continue to be driven predominantly by organic volume growth that can be readily accommodated by additional production shifts and equipment as necessary. 
 Commitment to innovation.    We have a long track record of successful product and process innovations that introduce valued new products and services to our customers and consumers. We are committed to continuing to invest in new product development and enhance customer service to strengthen our leading brands and penetrate adjacent markets.

Diverse sales end-use mix.    We sell in a variety of product categories in the U.S. home and security products markets. In addition, our exposure to changing levels of U.S. residential new home construction activity is balanced with repair-and-remodel activity, which comprised a substantial majority of the overall U.S. home products market and about two-thirds of our U.S. home products sales. We also benefit from a stable market for plumbing and security products and international sales growth opportunities. 
 Diverse sales channels.    We sell through a wide array of sales channels, including kitchen and bath dealers, wholesalers oriented to builders or professional remodelers, industrial and locksmith distributors, do-it-yourself remodeling-oriented home centers and other retail outlets. We also sell security products to locksmiths, industrial distributors and mass merchants. We are able to leverage existing sales channels to expand into adjacent product categories. In 2016, sales to our top ten customers represented less than half of total sales. 
 Decentralized business model.    Our business segments are focused on distinct product categories and are responsible for their own performance. This structure enables each of our segments to independently best position itself within each category in which it competes and reinforces strong accountability for operational and financial performance. Each of our segments focus on its unique set of consumers, customers, competitors and suppliers, while also sharing best practices. 
 Strong capital structure.    We exited 2016 with a strong balance sheet. In 2016, we repurchased $424.5 million of our shares. We amended and restated our credit agreement to combine and rollover the existing revolving credit facility and term loan into a new standalone $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, we had $251.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt was $1,431.1 million, resulting in a net debt position of $1,179.6 million. In addition, we had $710.0 million available under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2016. 
 Business Segments 
 We have four business segments: Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors and Security. The following table shows net sales for each of these segments and key brands within each segment: 

Segment | 2016 Net Sales(in millions) | | Percentage of Total 2016 Net Sales | | Key Brands

Our segments compete on the basis of innovation, fashion, quality, price, service and responsiveness to distributor, retailer and installer needs, as well as end-user consumer preferences. Our markets are very competitive. Approximately 15% of 2016 net sales were to international markets, and sales to two of the Companys customers, The Home Depot, Inc. (The Home Depot) and Lowes Companies, Inc. (Lowes), each accounted for more than 10% of the Companys net sales in 2016. Sales to all U.S. home centers in the aggregate were approximately 27% of net sales in 2016. 
 Cabinets.    Our Cabinets segment manufactures custom, semi-custom and stock cabinetry, as well as vanities, for the kitchen, bath and other parts of the home through a regional supply chain footprint to deliver high quality and service to our customers. This segment sells a portfolio of brands that enables our customers to differentiate themselves against competitors. This portfolio includes brand names such as Aristokraft, Mid-Continent, Diamond, Kitchen Classics, Kitchen Craft, Schrock, Omega, Homecrest, Thomasville, StarMark and Ultracraft. Substantially all of this segments sales are in North America. This segment sells directly to kitchen and bath dealers, home centers, wholesalers and large builders. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowes comprised approximately 33% of net sales of the Cabinets segment in 2016. This segments competitors include Masco, American Woodmark and RSI, as well as a large number of regional and local suppliers.

Our Plumbing segment manufactures or assembles and sells faucets, accessories, kitchen sinks and waste disposals in North America and China, predominantly under the Moen, Riobel, ROHL, Perrin & Rowe and Waste King brands.

Approximately 24% of 2016 net sales were to international markets. This segment sells directly through its own sales force and indirectly through independent manufacturers representatives, primarily to wholesalers, home centers, mass merchandisers and industrial distributors.

This segments chief competitors include Delta (owned by Masco), Kohler, Pfister (owned by Spectrum Brands), American Standard (owned by LIXIL Group), InSinkErator (owned by Emerson Electronic Company) and imported private-label brands. 
 Doors.    Our Doors segment manufactures and sells fiberglass and steel entry door systems under the Therma-Tru brand and urethane millwork product lines under the Fypon brand. This segment benefits from the long-term trend away from traditional materials, such as wood, steel and aluminum, toward more energy-efficient and durable synthetic materials. Therma-Tru products include fiberglass and steel residential entry door and patio door systems, primarily for sale in the U.S. and Canada. This segments principal customers are home centers, millwork building products and wholesale distributors, and specialty dealers that provide products to the residential new construction market, as well as to the remodeling and renovation markets. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowes comprised approximately 16% of net sales of the Doors segment in 2016. This segments competitors include Masonite, JELD-WEN, Plastpro and Pella.

 For additional financial information for each of our business segments, refer to Note 18, Information on Business Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Information 
 Raw materials.    The table below indicates the principal raw materials used by each of our segments. These materials are available from a number of sources. Volatility in the prices of commodities and energy used in making and distributing our products impacts the cost of manufacturing our products. 

Segment | Raw Materials 
Cabinets | Hardwoods (maple, cherry and oak), plywood and particleboard
Plumbing | Brass, zinc, resins, stainless steel and copper 
Doors | Glass, resins, wood, aluminum, steel and foam 
Security | Rolled steel, brass and resins 

 Intellectual property.    Product innovation and branding are important to the success of our business. In addition to the brand protection offered by our trademarks, patent protection helps distinguish our unique product features in the market by preventing copying and making it more difficult for competitors to benefit unfairly from our design innovation. We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering various features used in products sold within all of our business segments. Although each of our segments relies on a number of patents and patent groups that, in the aggregate, provide important protections to the Company, no single patent or patent group is material to any of the Companys segments. 
 Employees.    As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 22,700 full-time employees. 2,436 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A majority of these employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements that will expire within one year of the date on which this Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed. Employee relations are generally good. 
 Information about geographic areas.    For additional information about net sales and assets by geographic areas, refer to Note 18, Information on Business Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality.    All of our operating segments traditionally experience lower sales in the first quarter of the year when new home construction, repair-and-remodel activity and security buying are at their 
 
6 
 
 lowest. As a result of sales seasonality and associated timing of working capital fluctuations, our cash flow from operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the year. 
 Environmental matters.    We are involved in remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties (PRP) under Superfund or similar state laws. As of December 31, 2016, eleven such instances have not been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In 2016, one of our subsidiaries was identified as a PRP in a new instance and no instances were settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. In most instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for PRP costs. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other PRPs or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had accruals of $1.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively, relating to environmental compliance and cleanup including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites. Our year over year accrual decreased after we completed the remediation at one location. 
 Legal structure.    Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. is a holding company that was initially organized as a Delaware corporation in 1988. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company include MasterBrand Cabinets, Inc., Moen Incorporated, Fortune Brands Global Plumbing Group LLC, Fortune Brands Doors, Inc. and Fortune Brands Storage & Security LLC.

Accordingly, the rights of the Company, and thus the rights of our creditors (including holders of debt securities and other obligations) and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the claims of creditors of the subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of the Company itself as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized, in which event the Companys claims may in certain circumstances be subordinate to certain claims of others. In addition, as a holding company, the source of our unconsolidated revenues and funds is dividends and other payments from subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their abilities to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their capital stock or other payments to the Company.
