ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on October 1, 2020, whose business purpose is to enter into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our “initial business combination.” While we may pursue an initial business combination in any region or sector, we have initially focused our efforts on a biotech company that has demonstrated success and is primed to thrive in the rapidly evolving biotech industry for our initial business combination.
On September 18, 2020, Chardan Monterey purchased 5,000,000 shares of common stock from us for $25,000, or $0.005 per share. On May 20, 2021, Chardan Monterey transferred 687,500 founder shares back to us for no consideration, which shares were cancelled. On May 21, 2021, Chardan Monterey transferred 3,315,625 founder shares to NorthStar at a price of $0.006 per share. On May 21, 2021, NorthStar transferred 150,000 founder shares to Dr. Satyal, our chief executive officer, and transferred 35,000 founder shares to each of our directors at a price of $0.006 per share. On September 1, 2021, NorthStar transferred 1,078,125 founder shares back to us and Chardan Monterey transferred 359,375 founder shares back to us, in each case for no consideration, which shares were cancelled. As a result, NorthStar holds a balance of 1,912,500 founder shares and Chardan Monterey holds a balance of 637,500 founder shares. The founder shares included an aggregate of up to 375,000 shares that were subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriter’s over-allotment option was not exercised in full or in part, so that our initial stockholders would collectively own 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after our initial public offering. The over-allotment option was exercised in full on October 6, 2021; thus, these shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
The registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-259378) for our initial public offering was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 30, 2021. On October 5, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 10,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and one redeemable warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. On October 6, 2021, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option in full, resulting in our issuance of an additional 1,500,000 units at a public offering price of $10.00 per unit. After giving effect to the exercise and close of the option, an aggregate of 11,500,000 units have been issued in the initial public offering, with aggregate gross proceeds of $115,000,000.
Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 3,750,000 private warrants to NorthStar and 1,250,000 private warrants to Chardan Monterey, in each case at a price of $1.00 per private warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,000,000. In connection with the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, NorthStar purchased an additional 337,500 private warrants and Chardan Monterey purchased an additional 112,500 private warrants, in each case, at a price of $1.00 per private warrant, generating additional gross proceeds of $450,000.
A total of $116,150,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in our initial public offering and the sale of the private placements, including as a result of the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “trust account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) and which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations and for dissolution expenses up to $100,000, as applicable, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of our initial business combination by October 5, 2022 (or up to July 5, 2023, as applicable) (as discussed further below) and (ii) a redemption to public stockholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period.
Our units began trading on October 1, 2021 on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “MTRYU.” Commencing on November 22, 2021, the shares of common stock and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on Nasdaq under the symbols “MTRY” and “MTRYW,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “MTRYU.”

Our Competitive Advantage - Strong team of Management, Board and Co-Sponsors
Our business target selection process leverages the insights, extensive biotech network, knowledge and access of our board, co-sponsors, management team and advisors.
Scientific discoveries and the management of biotechnology companies are getting increasingly complex. Finding, developing and launching new drugs are particularly challenging and expensive. As a result, companies are turning to a multidisciplinary approach with selecting a management team. In addition, companies are looking for individuals with proven experience and a track record of success. We believe that a similar approach was necessary with regard to creating our special purpose acquisition company (“special purpose acquisition company” or “SPAC”).
We built our management team around the concept of combining individuals with extensive experience, varied backgrounds and skill sets. Our Chief Executive Officer, Sanjeev Satyal, has a proven and successful track record in the biotech industry and has robust operational experience. William McKeever, Chief Financial Officer, also brings a robust skill set that complements those of our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. McKeever has more than twenty years of significant experience in the healthcare industry and has successfully held key positions in equity research, portfolio management and investment banking. As a result, Mr. McKeever, has broad experience in identifying attractive companies.
In addition to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we believe that our company has also assembled a board of directors with wide-ranging knowledge and proven business experience. Their capabilities, concomitant with those of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, create a robust management team that brings technical expertise in biotechnology, financial knowledge and keen business acumen. As a result, we are positioned to identify robust biotechnology platforms with superior growth opportunities.
Our board members have long-standing and personal relationships with senior executives, founders and investors across the biotech, pharmaceutical and financial industries. We believe this extensive network provides significant access to assets and acquisition opportunities. Our board members also have an extensive track record and history of executing licensing deals, mergers and acquisitions, and other transactions. Furthermore, our board members have significant executive management and board level experience on both the public company and private company levels. They bring a breadth of experience in the life science industry, and throughout their respective careers have developed a network of additional resources such as investment banks, investment market participants, entrepreneurs, consultants and legal and accounting firms. We have leveraged, and plan to continue to leverage, these relationships to source further acquisition opportunities. Finally, our board of directors harbors strong credibility amongst the biotech investor community and boasts a proven ability to help companies navigate the capital markets, particularly in the marketing and executing of private to public transactions for growth companies.
Our co-sponsor, Chardan Monterey, is affiliated with Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, or Chardan, an investment firm and a provider of investment banking services, primarily focused on private and public emerging companies in the healthcare industry. Since its inception, Chardan has executed more than 500 equity capital markets transactions, raising approximately $26 billion of capital in both public and private markets. Chardan is a leading SPAC underwriter, SPAC sponsor (or co-sponsor) and SPAC M&A advisor, providing a highly competitive position as SPACs have become more accepted in the financial industry. Since 2004, Chardan has been the lead or co-lead underwriter on over 90 SPAC initial public offerings, as of September 2021. Chardan has sponsored or co-sponsored 13 SPACs with 7 successfully closed across multiple industries, 1 announced merger, 4 still in market, and 1 publicly filed. Chardan-advised SPACs have targeted a wide range of industries, including life sciences, healthcare services, technology hardware and software. No SPAC that has either been advised by Chardan or for which Chardan served as the lead underwriter has liquidated to date. Chardan has underwritten or advised over a dozen biotech focused SPACs. Since 2015, Chardan has met with private healthcare companies and has earned a reputation for partnering with innovative healthcare platforms to develop and deploy disruptive technologies.

Together, our management team, board, and co-sponsors have significant operational experience in drug discovery, research, clinical development, and management within the healthcare and financial industry. Upon successful completion of our initial business combination, our management team and independent directors may be available, and are willing, to help govern and/or guide continued success of operations. Examples of further contributions may include, but are not limited to, providing counsel on future strategic needs such as acquisitions, financing strategy and general business activities. Following an initial business combination, the team may also offer, as needed, an extensive operating network of relationships to help the business grow and achieve success.
For more details regarding our management team, see Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Annual Report.
Strategic Advisors
In addition to the members of our management team, we have established a strategic advisory group for the purpose of assisting our executive officers with sourcing and evaluating business combination opportunities.
Our strategic advisory group currently consists of the following person:
David V. Smith has over 35 years of leadership experience in healthcare, serving at companies such as Syntex, Chiron, Thoratec, and more. He has held a number of C-level positions for more than 20 years. Mr. Smith started his career as a Director of Finance and Administration for Genentech Europe in Switzerland. While there, he directed both the start-up and continuing operations of five European operating entities for finance, accounting, and human resources. Mr. Smith’s first Chief Financial Officer role was with Anergen, Inc., where he was responsible for finance and investor and public relations. He also served as the Chief Operating Officer for IntegenX, Inc., where he oversaw the company’s corporate development, manufacturing, customer service, and administrative functions. The company was later acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific in 2018. After the sale of IntegenX, Mr. Smith served as the Chief Financial Officer for Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc., leading the finance, accounting, investor relations, and corporate communications functions. Mr. Smith also co-led the effort to develop and implement strategies to grow the company’s drug bemarituzumab, later acquired by Amgen. Mr. Smith received his B.A. from the Willamette University and an M.B.A. from Golden Gate University. In addition, he is the Co-Founder of the Bay Area CFO’s Network in conjunction with Deloitte & Touche.
We may add additional members to the strategic advisory group from time to time. Unlike our management team, members of our strategic advisory group are not responsible for managing our day-to-day affairs and have no authority to engage in substantive discussions with business combination targets on our behalf. Pursuant to a Strategic Advisor Agreement between us and each member of our strategic advisory group, each strategic advisor will receive a cash payment of $50,000 upon, and subject to, consummation of our initial business combination, and will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with our search for an acquisition target and consummation of our initial business combination. In addition, subject to the agreement of the target company in our initial business combination, each strategic advisor will receive a grant of options to purchase up to 20,000 shares of common stock of the combined company, at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, following the initial business combination pursuant to an option agreement to be entered into between us (or the successor entity in our initial business combination) and the strategic advisor.
We believe that the combination of our management team and strategic advisory group is an innovative approach to identifying potential high quality business combination targets and aligns incentives with our stockholders, providing us with distinctive and differentiated capabilities to create stockholder value.
With respect to the foregoing descriptions, the past performance of Chardan and its affiliates, our management team and board of directors and our strategic advisory group is not a guarantee either (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. Messrs. Grossman and Patel have had management and/or board experience with blank check companies. None of our other officers or directors has had management experience with blank check companies or special purpose acquisition corporations in the past. You should not rely on their respective historical records or the performance of Chardan, its affiliates, our management team or board of directors or our strategic advisory group as indicative of our future performance. Our officers and directors may have conflicts of interest with other entities to which they owe fiduciary or contractual obligations with respect to initial business combination opportunities, including for Mr. Patel, with respect to Quantum FinTech Acquisition Corporation and for Mr. Grossman, with respect to Ventoux CCM Acquisition Corp., Chardan NexTech Acquisition Corp. and Chardan NexTech Acquisition 2 Corp., which we collectively refer to as the “Affiliated SPACs.”

Acquisition Sourcing and Strategy - Approach and Focus
Our acquisition strategy is to leverage our expertise and network relationships to identify, negotiate and acquire one or more business targets (i.e. companies), and/or in-license one or more assets, or combine business targets with in-licensed assets with the ultimate objective of building a public clinical stage biotech enterprise. It is our goal to evaluate business targets that are developing or enabling development of pre-commercial therapeutic candidates across a broad array of therapeutic areas, with an initial focus on oncology and immunology.
Approach – Leverage Team Network
Our business target sourcing and acquisition process leverages the insights, extensive biotech network, knowledge and access of our board, management team and advisors. We believe our team is well-positioned to identify compelling therapeutic candidate opportunities. We also anticipate that the networking and regular interactions of the board and our management team in the healthcare ecosystem, including at financial institutions, investment funds, venture capital firms and consultants, will continue to be a robust resource to identify potential business targets. We have employed a proactive, thematic sourcing strategy and to identify and prioritize business targets or assets where we believe the combination of the relationships, capital, capital markets expertise and operating experience of our co-sponsors and board, will accelerate the target business growth and performance.
The overarching thesis that drives our approach is our belief that therapeutic candidates with strong scientific data and rationale can generate meaningful outcomes for patients and therefore have the potential to generate meaningful commercial impact and financial return. We view potential acquisition candidates, initially focused on small molecule and biologics, through a lens that integrates potential patient benefit and anticipated clinical and regulatory development pathways, with the goal of identifying assets that have the potential to yield early but clear proof of concept clinical data leveraging innovation in genomic and biomarker and other technologies exploiting genetic underpinning of the disease.
With the expertise of the team, in the pursuit of an initial business combination, particular emphasis is placed on identifying superior management teams with novel technology platforms.
While we use the above guidelines to generally guide our approach, we are also opportunistic in assessing assets or companies that come to our attention. For example, this could include opportunities affiliated with our co-sponsors, executive officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our co-sponsors, executive officers or directors.
Market Opportunity
The therapeutics sector of the global healthcare market represents an attractive and expanding market opportunity with a substantial list of target acquisition opportunities. We believe current macro-economic trends will continue to support the growth of the therapeutics sector, and the biotechnology sub-sector in particular. More specifically we believe there is substantial opportunity to find attractive targets in oncology and immunology, as there are more than 1,800 oncology assets in development, representing the therapeutic areas with most assets, and 400 immunology assets currently in development.
Demand for healthcare products is increasing globally due to demographic shifts, rising middle class and prosperity trends, in addition to increased allocation of resources to healthcare and wellbeing. Total healthcare spending in the United States reached $3.8 trillion in 2019 and is expected to grow by an average 5.4 percent annually from 2019 to 2028, reaching nearly $6.2 trillion by 2028, according to a report by The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). Furthermore, total healthcare expenditures are expected rise to almost 20 percent of the US Gross Domestic Product by 2028. In addition, increased financial and in-kind contributions in less developed economies are driving unprecedented expansion of healthcare insurance and infrastructure.
Despite a substantial level of spending on healthcare, the United States does not achieve commensurate health outcomes, with several contributing factors, one such factor being that decision making processes regarding healthcare spending are not guided by an alignment of cost and expected outcomes. We believe the global healthcare market is poised to shift from paying for activities and inputs to paying for results and outcomes. As a result, the healthcare industry is positioned for new innovative technologies and business models to address the prevailing challenges associated with increasing costs, lack of adequate access to care and most importantly, patient outcomes.

We believe the biotech market creates a unique investment opportunity. Over the past ten years, venture capital funding has increased from approximately $3 billion to over $25 billion. This industry dynamic creates a favorable target pool, as VC funds seek liquidity events. Additionally, biotech M&A activity has more than doubled over the past decade, indicating a strong transaction appetite amongst the industry. Since 2018, there have been more than 25 biotech SPAC mergers announced or closed. The median enterprise value of these biotech SPAC targets was over $500 million. Given the favorable market factors, we believe Monterey Bio is well positioned within the biotech ecosystem.
Fundamental scientific discovery and innovation in biomedical sciences has led to the development of countless medicines for serious diseases and improved quality of life for patients. Sustained investments over decades in biomedical sciences by both government and industry have recently borne fruit, and the resulting scientific advances have yielded innovative medicines and new therapeutic modalities including cell and gene therapies. In the past decade, conventional therapeutic modalities, small molecule compounds and biologics, have also resulted in significant advances in treatments of diseases. Paradigm shifts in development of next generation cell and gene therapies products have potential to transform clinical outcomes for previously untreatable diseases and patient populations. Development of these breakthrough medicines are actively supported by regulatory agencies around the world, allowing companies to accelerate drug development processes and availability of treatments to patients. The US FDA and further national regulatory authorities are adjusting and streamlining their respective approval processes to accelerate and optimize the efficiency of bringing products to market. The number of novel drugs approved by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Review has increased substantially over the last ten years from 30 in 2011 to 53 in 2020.
The pace of innovation in drug discovery and development is also accelerating due to concurrent advancements in precision medicine, computational chemistry, structural biology and machine learning tools. These advances are enabling the industry to capitalize on insights of basic science and disease pathophysiology, and human genetic discoveries to develop drugs against disease mechanisms previously considered intractable or “undruggable”. Advances in precision medicine are similarly improving the design of clinical studies and leading to a better selection process of patients most likely to benefit from treatment. These converging trends of innovation are likely to enhance productivity in drug development leading to effective and accurate treatment options for patients while delivering cost savings.
Given the aforementioned growth and evolution within the healthcare and biotech industries, a broad universe of private companies, and by extension target acquisition companies, exists. Furthermore, this universe presents an attractive opportunity for a SPAC transaction, creating value not only for investors, but for the target company as well. At the core of industry growth lies disruptive innovation and by nature of the industry, a need for capital. A SPAC transaction can alleviate this need, providing a company with means to succeed. Monterey Bio’s team of management, board of directors, and co-sponsors are well suited to identify a target with a promising and proven product, primed for strong performance in the public markets.
Initial Business Combination
We will have until October 5, 2022 to consummate an initial business combination. In addition, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by October 5, 2022, we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our insiders or their affiliates, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to three times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 21 months, or by July 5, 2023, to complete a business combination); provided that, pursuant to the terms of our certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this prospectus, the only way to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination is for our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to each applicable deadline, to deposit into the trust account $1,150,000 ($0.10 per unit in either case, or an aggregate of $3,450,000, if the time to consummate a business combination is extended to a full 21 months), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. In the event that our insiders elected to extend the time to complete a business combination and deposited the applicable amount of money into trust, the insiders would receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or 

9



designees) may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the private warrants will expire and will be worthless.
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking or accounting firm as to the fair market value of the target business. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
We may, at our option, pursue a business combination opportunity jointly with Chardan or one or more entities affiliated with Chardan, which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” We do not expect that we would pursue any such opportunity with an Affiliated SPAC. Any such parties would co-invest only if (i) permitted by applicable regulatory and other legal limitations; (ii) we and Chardan considered a transaction to be mutually beneficial to us as well as the affiliated entity; and (iii) other business reasons exist to do so, such as the strategic merits of including such co-investors, the need for additional capital beyond the amount held in our trust account to fund the initial business combination and/or the desire to obtain committed capital for closing the initial business combination.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete our initial business combination if the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test, provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
Chardan is the beneficial owner of founder shares and private warrants by virtue of its ownership of Chardan Monterey and members of our management team may indirectly own such securities. In May 2021, NorthStar transferred an aggregate of 325,000 founder shares to our officers, directors and director nominees. Because of such ownership and interests, Chardan and our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Our co-sponsors, officers, directors, Chardan and their respective affiliates may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination. In particular, certain of our directors also serve as officers or directors of an Affiliated SPAC, which is focused on searching for businesses that may provide significant opportunities for attractive investor returns in industries similar to the industries in which our search is focused. As a result, our co-sponsors, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity, including an Affiliated SPAC. Our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any 

10



corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for one or more entities to which he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, including an Affiliated SPAC, he or she will honor these obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriters’ fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Human Capital Resources
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but has devoted, and intends to continue to devote, as much of his time as he deems necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Our Website
Our corporate website address is www.montereybio.com. The information contained on, or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our units, shares of common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, the financial information included in the proxy solicitation materials will need to be prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, or IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board or the IASB, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. The financial statements may also be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Form 8-K announcing the closing of an initial business combination, which would need to be filed within four business days thereafter. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial information. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.

We will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act beginning for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
