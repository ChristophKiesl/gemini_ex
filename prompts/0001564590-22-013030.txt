Overview 
 Bringing Central Lab Reliability to Single-Use Rapid Diagnostic Testing
 We are a medical technology company on a mission to bring central laboratory quality testing for infectious diseases into the home and point of care settings. We aim to have disposable, single use test kit platform replace central lab testing for accurately diagnosing infectious diseases leading to faster treatment and better disease control outcomes. We believe that society benefits from real-time and accurate disease detection in order to deploy time-sensitive therapeutic treatments for the individual and reduce spread of infection in the community. Currently, the United States relies on centralized lab testing for accurate disease detection. We believe testing labs are too geographically centralized, rely too heavily on instrumented equipment, and are expensive and difficult to access. With our polymerase chain reaction, or PCR-quality technology, we offer decentralized and accessible single-use testing for infectious diseases. Our test kits are coupled with our digital platform, LUCI PASS, which is designed to securely deliver a clinically relevant test result to users, healthcare providers, and to required public health authorities.  We plan on developing and commercializing lab quality single-use test kits for several infectious diseases and have started by commercializing our PCR-quality COVID-19 test kits.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented pressure on the current U.S. healthcare system. We believe the pandemic demonstrated that the infectious disease testing infrastructure in the United States was too quickly overwhelmed to efficiently and reliably detect COVID-19 early enough to drive effective treatment and better patient outcomes. To suppress the spread of infection in the population, we believe testing should be fast, accurate, and away from other people so as to reduce potential transmission. While PCR lab testing for COVID-19 is trusted and accurate, it is slow, inconvenient and centralized. Rapid at-home antigen testing for COVID-19 is fast and decentralized but the test method has accuracy challenges, especially in the face of variants. There are widespread reports of people receiving negative test results from rapid antigen test kits only to receive a positive PCR result days later from the lab. We believe false negative results from rapid antigen testing can create a false sense of security, confuse the public, and lead to increased infection rates.  
 We believe that providing a fast and easy-to-use at-home COVID-19 test kit with PCR-quality accuracy is one of the best ways to help mitigate against the spread of infection and foster better treatment decisions. The traditional testing infrastructure within the United States is not designed to provide fast and convenient PCR-quality results because our historical infrastructure requires the sophistication of a central lab. With our platform, we are reimagining current infectious disease testing through innovative test kits that are designed to deliver on-the-spot testing with PCR-quality in a single-use, portable, and easy-to-use format. Our platform is designed to produce assays that combine the accuracy and reliability of PCR tests and the accessibility and ease of use of antigen tests. Our molecular test kits are designed to be diagnostically definitive, unlike the antigen tests on the market today.  Importantly, our tests also provide a platform for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals to easily check their COVID-19 infection status in 30 minutes or less, thus providing a testing solution that can be utilized at high scale as we begin navigating a new normal living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease.
 We also believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving and so are the reasons for testing.  While people have tested to prevent spread of infection through isolation and hoped for recovery, we believe that moving forward, people will seek PCR-quality at-home tests to treat infection as quickly as possible. We believe this new “test to treat” paradigm will become increasingly important as COVID-19 becomes endemic. This is because new therapies for COVID-19 infection are now available contingent upon accurate and early testing. New oral antivirals from Pfizer (Paxlovid) and Merck (molnupiravir) are available by prescription after receiving EUA to treat COVID-19 in certain people who are at increased risk for severe illness. Both Paxlovid and molnupiravir may only be prescribed after a positive COVID-19 test and within five days of symptom onset, suggesting that early detection and initiation of treatment is correlated with better outcomes. The same is true for monoclonal antibody treatments.

On March 2, 2022, President Joe Biden announced a new “test to treat” federal initiative during his State of the Union address. Under the “test to treat” initiative, individuals will have immediate access to COVID-19 therapeutics at the pharmacy upon testing positive for COVID-19. We believe our test kits can play an important role in facilitating a “test to treat” paradigm because our tests are PCR-quality and therefore able to detect infection early, which can lead to early therapy and potentially better outcomes. This is because PCR lab testing is understood to detect viral genetic material at the earliest stages of infection because it amplifies trace amounts of virus DNA. Rapid antigen tests are understood to be less sensitive because antigen tests do not amplify the virus. A person must have first produced enough antigens in their body to return a positive result, which could be up to seven days into their infectious stage and mostly past the time for an anti-viral to be effective. We believe this leads to potential delays in detection and a potential loss of trust in rapid antigen test results. We believe the U.S. healthcare system is in need of PCR-quality testing to be delivered with the convenience of rapid antigen test kits along with a digitally shareable test record the public can trust.
Our first commercially available PCR-quality diagnostic test was the LUCIRA COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit, which received EUA from the FDA for prescription use in at-home settings, and point-of-care, or POC. Our COVID-19 test kit was the first at-home self-test to receive FDA EUA authorization, and remains the only FDA EUA authorized single-use molecular test for at-home use. On April 9, 2021, we received our first FDA EUA authorization for over-the-counter, or OTC, non-prescription use among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals aged 14 and older (with self-collection) and children aged 2-13 (with parent collection) and launched LUCI PASS, our digital platform designed to securely record and share verified test results via text messaging. The LUCIRA CHECK IT COVID-19 Test Kit utilizes identical components to the LUCIRA COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit and both are referred to as test kits or COVID-19 test kits. On April 26, 2021, we received authorization with conditions from Health Canada for our CHECK IT test kit, and the conditions were removed on June 1, 2021. On June 11, 2021, we received approval from the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare for emergency use in Taiwan. On October 12, 2021, we received Pandemic Special Access Route, or PSAR, approval for our CHECK IT test kit by Singapore's Health Sciences Authority. On November 2, 2021, Israel approved registration of our CHECK IT test kit with a requirement for PCR confirmation of any positive test. On January 10, 2022, Israel recognized our CHECK IT test kit as a PCR-quality test for POC use. In the second half of 2022, we hope to obtain several new regulatory approvals including extending our EUA authorization into full FDA approval via de novo application, CE Mark, and submissions to the United Kingdom and Australia to further extend access to international markets. 
 We believe that enabling PCR-quality at-home testing for infectious disease testing outside of COVID-19 is critical for enabling treatment and preventing disease spread. Our PCR-quality platform is designed with a flexible assay architecture in which we can largely leverage all these components to accelerate the development of new test kits for additional indications, including other infectious diseases such as sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, and other respiratory infections. We plan on seeking EUA authorization from FDA for prescription use, authorization from Health Canada, and European Medicines Agency, and CE Mark, to commercialize a combination COVID-19/influenza A/B, or COVID/flu combo test, in the first half of 2022. We expect to grow our test kit platform offerings in the future. 
 Our Test Kit Platform 
 Our PCR-quality platform is designed to leverage the following competitive benefits: 
  
• | Accurate. Molecular testing methods utilize nucleic acid amplification-based chemistries to achieve PCR-quality Limit of Detection or LoD. The amplification chemistries generate copies of the genetic targets allowing even low levels of target to be detected. Our platform utilizes LAMP, which we believe provides high accuracy results that are recognized as PCR-quality by FDA. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized. Our platform is designed to serve as a miniature, disposable and accessible infectious disease diagnostic laboratory. It is designed to be untethered from reader or hub equipment and deployable anywhere lab-quality accuracy is needed, whether at the point of care or in the home. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simple and intuitive. We designed our test kit platform to be used anywhere and at any time. Ease of use is paramount to our design from sample collection to sample insertion for analysis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2


 
• | No durable equipment. Unlike other molecular test providers, our test kit platform is designed without the need for a durable component, test reader, hub, or other cumbersome equipment. We believe that the utility provided by our all-in-one design is preferred to solutions requiring additional equipment and cost.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible with potential for broad applicability. We built our platform to be flexible and applicable to additional assays using the same core test kit. As an example of our platform’s agility and robustness, we leveraged over half a decade of research and development and expertise in target identification and assay development for influenza into a test kit for COVID-19.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Fundamentally, our PCR-quality platform has the following four key attributes: 
 1. Robust target identification.
 
• | The first step of the development process is identification of the genetic target. The target is a small stretch of the pathogen’s genetic material that will be amplified and detected by our colorimetric assay. We have developed robust, proprietary in-house capabilities for identifying such targets for a broad range of pathogens. Through our innovative platform, we are able to identify and test potential targets against large databases of available sequences of the pathogen of interest.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2. Colorimetric assay.
 
• | Amplification: Once targets have been identified, we can begin to design assays that allow for amplification and detection of these targets in patient samples. Amplification chemistry is the process by which a single copy of the target is copied to “amplify” its abundance, and the process helps detection chemistries identify the pathogenic target of interest in a sample. We use a form of amplification called LAMP. LAMP allows for target amplification powered by just two AA batteries, unlike other amplification methods which require more power.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Detection: Unlike most assay chemistries, which rely on the use of fluorescent signals to detect amplification, we use our proprietary colorimetric chemistry for detection. This eliminates the need for complex and expensive instrumentation. Using colorimetric detection, as amplification proceeds the color of the reaction changes and is monitored using inexpensive LEDs and photosensor elements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3. Consumer-friendly test kit.
 
• | Usability: Our test kit brings centralized laboratory accuracy in an intuitive, consumer-friendly design and comes with clear instructions and all the necessary components to operate it. Furthermore, our test kit displays a clear result that users can correctly identify, thus eliminating the subjectivity of user confirmation. This minimalist design and workflow is intended to ensure high usability and broad accessibility, with the goal of enhancing our test kit’s appeal for decentralized, mass-population testing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Designed for automated, low-cost manufacturing: Our test kits were specifically designed for low-cost production at scale. Our intentional design choices allow for low-cost hardware by eliminating the need for pumps and valves. The colorimetric process uses inexpensive LEDs, and photosensors. As we reach threshold production volume, our test kits were designed to be manufactured at costs low enough to be sold profitability to consumers, at a price point we believe could grow OTC consumer purchase demand.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4. Adaptable test kit architecture. 
  
• | In support of our goal to design and provide a platform with broad applicability, we designed our platform to allow us to adapt the test kit bases into which chemistries are run to the

development of new test kits addressing additional infectious diseases. We anticipate that our colorimetric detection in our test kit base can be used in a broad range of applications and that the test kit bases can be applied to other indications with minor modifications and an indication-specific disease pellet. Our platform is further capable of expanding the number of independent reaction chambers that in turn increases our ability to multiplex.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the elements comprising our platform create test kits that, if approved, are capable of bringing accurate, reliable, on-the-spot infectious disease testing anywhere, at any time. We also believe our PCR-quality platform addresses historical challenges and can unlock the ability to provide mass-population infectious disease testing anywhere and at any time. Because our platform is designed to be portable and easy-to-use, people will be able to take the test anywhere, including at-home. This would greatly reduce the burden and risks placed on public health facilities when people would otherwise travel to them for testing. Since our easy-to-use platform has been designed to provide results quickly, in 30 minutes or less for our COVID-19 test kit, people will also quickly know if they are potentially infectious and can immediately begin avoiding contact with others to mitigate disease spread. 
 We believe our platform combines the benefits of accuracy and reliability of a centralized laboratory test with the speed, and ease of use of an antigen test. According to many virologists, the most important time to mitigate the spread of infectious disease and deploy therapeutics is early in a pathogen’s infectious period. With our platform’s proprietary technology, we designed our test platform to detect infections early, therefore mitigating the spread of an infectious disease and filling an important gap in the current testing infrastructure.

Our First Test Kit Offering – COVID-19
The following picture depicts our COVID-19 test kit utilized whether at POC or at-home. On the left we show our simple test kit as presented to our end user. On the right, we show the miniature, disposable, single use laboratory beneath the packaging. 
 

We believe our COVID-19 test kit possesses all of the benefits of our technological platform and produces a PCR-quality result within 30 minutes, with the potential for a positive COVID-19 result in as few as 11 minutes.  
Our COVID-19 test kit contains everything needed to perform one COVID-19 test, including: (1) quick reference instructions that provide step-by-step instructions for use, (2) one sterile nasal swab for self-collection of a nasal specimen in the lower nostrils, (3) one sample vial that contains liquid buffer into which the swab is stirred, (4) one test unit base that contains the chemistry and displays the result, (5) two AA batteries to power the test unit base and (6) one disposal bag to dispose of the test kit in regular waste.
 
What Sets Us Apart from Centralized Lab PCR Tests – Our solution costs less to manufacture and provides a faster time to result
 Centralized lab tests for infectious disease require large upfront investments and expensive on-going maintenance and supply contracts, and highly trained operations, leaving them only available in large hospital systems and other labs concentrated in high population areas. Our solution is less expensive to develop and manufacture. Regardless of the speed of the test, central lab testing can require significant time to produce results because of the complex workflow required for lab testing.  First a doctor’s visit is needed to obtain a lab order. Then a sample collection visit is required (or use of a mail-in collection kit). Next, transportation of the sample to the lab occurs and finally it is processed at the lab and results transmitted. Our test kit provides a result within 30 minutes from sample collection. We provide a faster solution because our lab sits in the palm of your hand. 
 What Sets Us Apart from Rapid Antigen Tests – Our solution is more accurate and clinically relevant 
 Rapid antigen tests, while cheap and widely available, suffer from the inability to detect infection outside of the window of peak viral load, which generally occurs in the earlier stages of infection. Accordingly, a positive antigen test result is more likely to occur in the later stages of infection.  We believe this later positive

detection reduces the antigen tests’ utility as a tool for driving treatment because therapies generally produce the best outcomes when prescribed and administered in the early stages of infection.  Just one of our COVID-19 test kits can produce an actionable result in 30 minutes that could otherwise take up to three tests: two antigen tests taken 24-48 hours apart and an additional confirmatory POC or lab-based PCR test.  We further believe that reliance on government mandated antigen testing to confirm a negative result will wane as COVID-19 becomes endemic and society becomes focused on testing that can timely and accurately detect and drive treatment.  We believe antigen testing may not meet this need and therefore its demand will potentially shrink.
 What Sets Us Apart from POC Antigen and PCR Tests – Our solution is less expensive for health care providers, easier to access and portable
POC tests have effectively moved infectious disease testing closer to the patient, and are often deployed in large multi-physician clinics, urgent care centers, and smaller and more remote hospitals that do not have large central lab equipment. While more affordable for health care providers than central lab assays, POC equipment also requires investment and maintenance and highly trained operators and technicians to collect the sample. We are a less expensive solution for the health care provider because our test requires none of this infrastructure. POC tests are still inaccessible to many consumers because they must secure and complete an appointment with a physician and physically interact with a healthcare technician to collect the sample. Our solution is easier to access through our OTC and prescription at-home authorization. Likewise, tests conducted at the POC have limited throughput. Our solution is portable and self-contained with no throughput limitation. Multiple large integrated delivery networks, or IDNs, are now using our tests as both an alternative and a supplement to POC tests because there is no additional investment, beyond purchase of our test kits, and they can use our tests expand throughput capacity. 
 What Sets Us Apart from Other At-Home Molecular Tests – Our solution is easier to use and is an all-in-one test kit
 Only two competitors offer at-home molecular testing platforms that include a hub and cartridge model. While both tests produce similar accuracy with similar time to result as our solution, their hubs require a durable investment with a larger form factor. One competitor offers a hub as a separate expense and can only communicate results to a smart phone. As a result, that testing experience requires three devices – a hub, a cartridge and a smartphone – two of which need to be charged and may require software updates prior to use. We believe our solution is easier to use because it requires no hub or smartphone. The other competitor’s solution may offer a cheaper hub and requires no smart phone, but the testing process runs for an hour. Additionally, tests relying on a hub create an unnecessary bottleneck because multiple members of a family or group cannot test on the same hub at the same time. Our all-in-one single use solution means that testing throughput is not limited by hub availability. Among currently authorized at-home molecular tests, only our test kit can be purchased and used anywhere, anytime and can also be used as a POC, prescription at-home, and OTC test.

Our Digital Test Record Platform
 We have also developed a text message-based electronic test record we call LUCI PASS to use with our COVID-19 test kit. A sample record is pictured below:
 

Our LUCI PASS platform is designed to provide a reliable and electronically transmittable digital record of the test result. We believe LUCI PASS provides the following competitive benefits: 
  
• | Device agnostic reporting. We designed LUCI PASS records to be a text-based reporting platform that accessible from a wide range of mobile phones. We designed LUCI PASS to avoid the complexity and inconvenience of installing a smartphone app to create a test record. Instead, users create and share web-based records and PDF files recording their test results and identifying the test kit that was used. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shareable test results. We believe that the world is entering a phase in which COVID-19 and other infectious disease testing will be done primarily for the purpose of seeking treatment. Testing to treat infection requires that reliable results are transmittable to health care providers as quickly and easily as possible. We believe the simplicity of sharing a LUCI PASS digital record can speed access to treatments requiring a trusted test result as a condition of prescription. Secure cloud storage can enable direct digital connection to healthcare providers and health systems.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fosters return to normal activities with ease. While we believe testing to treat infection will be the primary reason for testing in the future, we also believe that testing to show proof of negative infection status will continue for the near term. We designed LUCI PASS to serve as an easy-to-use negative test verification tool for large and small gatherings such as sporting activities, workplace gatherings, weddings, concerts and conferences.

 Infectious Disease Testing Landscape and Limitations
 Diagnostic tests and procedures are used to assist in the detection, monitoring and treatment of diseases and medical conditions through the examination of substances across various specimen types including nasal, saliva, blood, urine, and tissue, among others. The results of such tests can assist in the evaluation of health status, the detection of conditions or pathogens, treatment of disease and prevention of spread of disease. There are a number of different testing modalities and settings of care that all serve to provide information to support clinical diagnosis and have become familiar to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Infectious disease tests usually fall into one of three categories: molecular tests, antigen tests and antibody tests. 
Antigen Tests
 Antigen tests are designed to detect specific viral surface proteins and do not use an amplification step.  As a result, until a large amount of virus is present, antigen tests may produce false negative results.  Antigen tests tend to be of limited use until symptom onset and often require a follow-on confirmatory test via a more accurate molecular test to determine if viral material is present. This creates a time lag that can lead to the spread of infection while waiting for a diagnostically definitive result. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, one in five patients with symptoms and a confirmed case of COVID-19 received a negative rapid antigen test result. Accordingly, antigen tests are more likely to catch infection at a delayed time when viral load is high and therapeutics may not be effective. We believe that antigen tests have become a stopgap measure for mass-population testing because they are rapid, low-cost and portable. They are generally available OTC and conducted in the home.  While users may favor OTC or at-home testing and fast time to test results, we believe that antigen tests are too unreliable for an accurate clinical diagnosis.   
 Antibody Tests
Antibody tests target human antibodies which are produced after the body has encountered and responded to a pathogenic threat. Antibodies can exist in the blood in varying concentrations and times depending on the individual immune response and the specific pathogen. The existence of antibodies usually occurs well after a person is infectious and thus antibody tests may indicate whether, not when, there has been exposure to a certain pathogen. Antibody tests have limited clinical relevance because they do not test for active infection and therefore do not indicate whether a person is contagious.  
Molecular Tests  
 Molecular tests target the viral genetic material (DNA or RNA) and are considered to be the most reliable due to high accuracies afforded by molecular amplification technologies, such as PCR and LAMP. A LoD is the defining measure of an assay’s ability to reliably detect the presence of a specific target, such as viral RNA or protein (in the case of an antigen test). It is defined as the lowest target concentration at which the assay can generate a positive result ≥95% of the time. Tests with lower LoDs are more sensitive than tests with higher LoDs as the former can detect positive samples with low viral load. Typically, molecular tests have a much lower LoD compared to antigen tests given molecular tests’ ability to amplify a target. Among the current best performing molecular assays, the LoD is 1,000 cps / mL VTM equivalent or lower. In contrast, antigen tests, which do not amplify the target, are inherently less sensitive than molecular tests and thus are not considered diagnostically definitive, often requiring follow-on molecular confirmatory testing. Antigen tests, and some poor-performing molecular tests may have LoDs that are orders of magnitude higher than accurate tests.
 Low LoD tests enable infection to be caught earlier allowing for interventions to be most effective. A case study is provided below in an excerpt from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on SARS-CoV-2. As can be seen in the figure below, the viral load in an infected patient increases over a window of several days. PCR-quality molecular tests can detect the infection before the onset of symptoms. Such early detection can not only prevent spread but also lead to the use of antiviral drugs earlier in the course of infection, thereby making them more effective.

In short, molecular tests can detect diseases earlier in their incubation periods and are considered diagnostically definitive. Traditional infectious disease molecular tests, such as those that use PCR for the amplification step also tend to incorporate fluorescence for the detection step and this necessitates specialized equipment that is expensive and complex.  Our PCR-quality LAMP molecular test kit provides accuracy similar to that of PCR without the need for PCR or fluorescent detection, thereby enabling low cost to produce, portability, ease of use and elimination of the need for an instrument.
 Testing Settings and the Typical Patient Journey 
 
Current settings of care for the most common diagnostic testing include centralized high or medium-complexity laboratories, near-patient or POC, and at-home settings. 
  Molecular Testing Through Centralized High or Medium-Complexity Laboratories 
 Central laboratories have historically been the most common setting for molecular tests – like the PCR test for COVID-19 – are accessed.  However, central labs were designed to conduct highly accurate testing for non-infectious diseases that do not require immediate results, such as tests for diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The current centralized lab testing environment provides test results in days and this hinders the ability to provide immediate on-the-spot results that are most beneficial for diagnosing and treating infection. 
 Accessibility to central lab testing is controlled by the health care provider.  The patient process is visually depicted below:
 9



This lengthy, multistep process is time-consuming.  A sample must be obtained and delivered to centralized facilities for processing. The patient sample is collected at a physician’s office, at a third-party collection location, or in the home. The sample goes into a sample transport medium (to preserve the sample) and is physically delivered, by mail or courier, to a centralized facility where it can be processed and analyzed. Some laboratories use high throughput technology that employs automated processing of more than 200 specimens a day to maximize economics per test.  As a result of per-test economics, labs may collect samples over time until the lab test equipment can be run in the most cost-effective manner. The results are then either sent electronically to the POC, where the physician provides the results, or directly to the patient. The high-complexity laboratory approach typically has the longest turnaround time ranging from 24 hours to two weeks or longer depending on factors including the time to acquire the sample, sample delivery times, facility testing queue, processing time and delivery of results to the physician or patient. 
 Molecular and Antigen Testing at the Point of Care
 POC testing refers to near-patient testing and typically occurs at the time of consultation with a medical professional. There are a variety of molecular and antigen tests used in the POC setting, including COVID-19 and influenza. POC testing can occur at hospitals, physician offices, urgent care clinics and retail clinics.  The circulation of potentially infectious individuals among others leads to a threat of spread. Patient samples are collected in-person and the sample is usually transported to a nearby specialized instrument. These specialized instruments usually have a streamlined workflow that makes the test less complicated to run than a central lab test. However, these tests generally still require a trained operator to collect the sample and perform the test, and can produce results in anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours assuming the instrument is ready to be used and there is no sample queue or maintenance needed and trained personnel are available. Depending on processing time and proximity of the lab, test results can be communicated as early as the time of consultation but typically require additional time and may be provided up to several hours later during a surge of testing. The potentially infectious person may still expose healthcare providers and others. 
 Prescription At-Home Testing 
 The goal of prescription at-home testing is to allow people to administer the test and obtain results without needing a trained person to assist. These tests are typically designed to be intuitive and easy-to-use with minimal workflow steps to minimize user error. They usually have simple sample collection mechanics such as nasal swabs or urine collection sticks and are usually able to produce easily interpreted results in under 60 minutes. Prescription at-home tests can be delivered to the patient’s home so that the test can be performed without the patient leaving his or her home. When patients can conduct a test and obtain an accurate, on-the-spot result in the 
 10


convenience of their home, they can immediately self-isolate and reach out to a healthcare provider, thereby mitigating the spread of disease while obtaining healthcare counseling or treatment. 
 While there are FDA-authorized tests for remote or at-home sample collection, ours is the first FDA-authorized, under an EUA, COVID-19 test kit that can be fully self-administered and provide results at-home without the need for additional instrumentation.  
 OTC At-Home Testing 
 OTC testing refers to test kits available for purchase at retail and e-commerce locations such as drug stores, grocery stores, or other large retailers. OTC testing does not require a prescription. 
 Our test is the only single use, all-in-one OTC COVID-19 molecular testing option currently available. We believe that providing a highly accurate molecular, easy to use at-home test enables testing to be conducted sooner after suspected exposure and thereby offers the potential for early treatment. We believe there is going to be a paradigm shift from centralized testing for infectious disease to decentralized testing including both the OTC and POC markets. We believe that decentralized yet highly accurate and easy-to-use testing, when combined with treatment, will change the course of infectious disease. Our goal is to be a leader in decentralized early disease detection.
 COVID-19 and Influenza A/B
 Disease
 COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic. The CDC’s current and non-exhaustive list of symptoms includes fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea. While most people have mild symptoms, some people face more serious consequences, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, possibly precipitated by cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, blood clots and death. The typical pre-symptomatic incubation period can range from two to 14 days, enabling potential viral spread.
 This virus is spread primarily via small droplets from coughing, sneezing and talking. It is believed that the point at which people are most contagious is early in the course of their illness, particularly when they are beginning to experience symptoms. According to the CDC, a patient is potentially contagious until 10 days following symptom onset, resolution of fever for at least 24 hours and improvement of other symptoms, although viral spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who are asymptomatic In April 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, reported that according to preliminary data, people might be more contagious within the first three days from the onset of symptoms. Longer-term damage to organs (in particular lungs and heart) has also been observed, and there is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects including severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low grade fever, muscle weakness, breathlessness and other symptoms for months afterwards. 
 From December 2020 through February 2022, the FDA issued EUAs for three COVID-19 vaccines, two of which became fully approved. The FDA also issued EUAs for three therapeutic treatments. However, we believe the need for ongoing detection and monitoring will continue given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that COVID-19 variants will continue to emerge and potentially cause periodic and/or seasonal surges. However, new therapeutics such as Pfizer’s Paxlovid antiviral pill represents a paradigm shift in the fight against COVID-19.  Healthcare providers are now able to help their patients recover from COVID-19 and avoid severe infection.  Likewise, we believe that the availability of Paxlovid by prescription will give the general population a new and compelling reason to reliably identify COVID-19 infection as early as possible. We believe central lab-based PCR testing is not conducive to serving this emerging “test to treat” market because it is slow and inconvenient for the patient and physician. Our solution can be deployed in the home – via telemedicine if needed – or at the point of care without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. Within 30 minutes, a positive PCR-quality test result from our test kit 
 11


can be translated into a prescription for Paxlovid as opposed to waiting a day or more for a PCR test result.  We believe our faster molecular test result can potentially drive better health outcomes when coupled with earlier access to prescription therapeutics like Paxlovid.
 Influenza, commonly known as “the flu,” is an infectious respiratory disease caused by an influenza virus. Symptoms can be mild to severe (including death) and commonly include high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle and joint pain, headache, coughing, and fatigue. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week. The cough, however, may last for more than two weeks. Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure. There are currently four known types of influenza viruses. Two of these, influenza A and B, are the most common among human infections. Seasonal influenza is caused by influenza A and B viruses, while pandemic influenza occurs when a novel influenza strain appears. Usually, the virus is spread through the air from coughing or sneezing. A person may be infectious to others both before and during the time they are showing symptoms. 
 Influenza-related costs include direct costs such as lost productivity and associated medical treatment, as well as indirect costs of preventive measures. The CDC estimates that influenza has been responsible for between 12,000 and 61,000 deaths in the United States annually since 2010. In the United States, seasonal influenza is estimated to result in a total average annual economic cost of over $11.0 billion, with direct medical costs estimated to be over $3.0 billion annually. According to industry estimates, a future influenza pandemic could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs. We believe the current centralized testing infrastructure is equally ill-equipped to support the testing needs of a future influenza pandemic. 
 Combined COVID-19 and Influenza Market for Testing
 COVID-19 diagnostic testing volume in the United States grew rapidly to approximately 250 million tests in 2020.  During 2021, testing volume was estimated at approximately 465 million tests reported through centralized lab, POC and at-home testing. This estimate does not include unreported at-home testing, the majority of which is rapid antigen based and not PCR-quality. Additionally, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were an estimated 40 million influenza tests performed annually in laboratory and POC settings in the United States but approximately 230 million people purchased products to treat the flu-like symptoms. We believe there was a substantial population who treated flu-like symptoms without a confirmed flu diagnosis. As COVID-19 moves to the endemic stage, we believe people will be unable to definitively determine based on symptoms alone whether a person has COVID-19, or influenza or another viral infection because the symptoms are virtually identical. However, the treatments for these infections are very different.  Therefore, we believe patients and healthcare providers alike will demand a trusted, and immediate diagnosis to pinpoint the type of infection to drive treatment and behavior. We estimate a 2022 total addressable market of approximately $8.4 billion to diagnose COVID-19 and/or influenza in the United States. We estimate that the international market opportunity is up to three times greater than the U.S. market opportunity.
Other Infectious Diseases and Markets for Testing
 There are several other common infectious diseases, apart from COVID-19 and flu, that require testing for effective treatment. We believe that a PCR-quality at-home testing platform can disrupt the existing diagnostic market for these infections because testing is limited to the central lab or complex POC instruments. There are no at-home, PCR-quality solutions for the following infections:

• | Strep throat, which infects approximately 600 million people worldwide and frequently requires treatment with antibiotics.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Chlamydia trachomatis, or Ct, which is the most common bacterial cause of STIs worldwide with more than approximately 131 million annual infections according to the WHO. The CDC recommends regular testing for multiple population groups as infection can be asymptomatic.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or Ng, which is the second most reported disease in the United States that requires notification to government authorities by law. The CDC recommends regular testing for multiple population groups.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our PCR-quality testing platform can be further developed to detect infection in these disease states and potentially others.  
 Research and Development and Product Pipeline
 As of December 31, 2021, our research and development, or R&D, team consisted of 28 people conducting research and product development activities. Our R&D team has been working on developing our platform over the last seven years and have optimized the device design, performance and usability over the course of several clinical and pre-clinical studies. Our R&D team is focused on three core areas: creation of new products for existing markets and unmet needs, advancing our innovation pipeline to further advance our differentiated platform product offerings, and sustaining engineering and cost reduction initiatives that continually improve device performance and lower our cost to manufacturer product. We have strong capabilities such as mechanical and electrical engineering, fluidics and software design in our engineering team and assay development, biochemistry, microbiology and bioinformatics in our assay development team. 
 Our development pipeline includes test kits focused on respiratory and sexual health.  Our immediate focus is to expand our COVID-19 test kit to a COVID-19/flu combo test, which is currently undergoing validation and clinical studies. To date, clinical trial results for our candidate COVID-19/flu combo test demonstrated similar sensitivity and specificity to highly sensitive lab-based PCR assays for COVID-19, Flu A and Flu B. In parallel, we are performing feasibility evaluation on both respiratory syncytial virus and Group A strep. We expect a phase gate review in the second half of 2022. We are also exploring the feasibility of using our platform for Ct and Ng. We recently published assay feasibility results, collected in Fiji, for our chlamydia assay. 



Commercial Strategy and Growth
 Our commercial strategic objective is to deploy our PCR-quality COVID-19 test kit –delivered in the palm of your hand – to new and existing customers who will continue to require accurate and immediate diagnoses as COVID-19 moves to the endemic stage. Throughout 2021 we discovered that customers specifically sought our testing solution because it was and continues to be unique in the market.  We provide the only solution in the market for immediate PCR-quality test results at the POC and at home in a single-use self-contained and fully disposable form factor.  
 We believe these customers will be durable, repeat long-term customers of our testing solutions because of their need for accuracy, immediacy, and portability of COVID-19 testing.  In the future we expect their needs will 
 13


evolve into a combined COVID-19/flu PCR-quality test.  We believe these durable customers fall into four customer segments: (1) U.S. healthcare systems and providers; (2) business and governments; (3) self-directed consumers in the home; and (4) international customers with local market needs.
 To achieve our commercial objectives, we are focusing on the following business strategies:
  
• | Continuing to expand our commercial organization with top talent lead by our Chief Revenue Officer who has responsibility for our commercial organization including the direct sales, marketing, and customer experience teams.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing manufacturing capacity to meet outsized and continued customer demand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leveraging the demand we saw in 2021 for decentralized and immediate PCR-quality COVID-19 testing into the long-term leading solution in the market for early and accurate detection of COVID-19 at the POC and at-home.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Driving the adoption of our current test kit and digital LUCI Pass solutions through direct sales and marketing efforts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Entering into key distribution arrangements in the United States to drive sales to larger health care systems and IDNs who specifically require our PCR-quality decentralized solution to facilitate mandatory day of surgery COVID-19 testing, high risk emergency surgeries and testing at POC to drive patient treatment decisions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cultivating distributor arrangements, educating and leveraging these distributors to develop our “test to treat” model in their local markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transitioning our larger customers from ordering “as needed” to engaging in longer term contracts that specify purchases requirements up to 12 months.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to develop the market for lab quality, at-home or POC testing that was reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic in preparation for the development of new test kits.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 U.S. Healthcare

 We believe our market advantage with the U.S. healthcare customer segment is a result of our PCR-quality reliability combined with decentralized immediacy of diagnosis.  This permits our healthcare customers to use our test kit to drive treatment decisions in a manner that antigen tests and PCR tests at the central lab cannot.  For this reason, we have become the solution of choice for certain telehealth platforms and providers who are able to confirm diagnosis immediately and over a telehealth platform to drive treatment.  We believe we will continue to be the solution of choice for telehealth and in office physician groups as new COVID-19 therapeutics become more widely available and require the earliest accurate diagnosis.  
 Likewise, we believe we have become a preferred solution for pre-surgery COVID-19 testing as surgery generally cannot proceed with confirmed infection.  Such pre-surgery testing is likely to continue as COVID-19 becomes endemic.  Accordingly, IDNs, surgery centers, emergency rooms and urgent care centers rely on our differentiated and flexible testing solution to provide PCR-quality results without relying on large equipment or a reader to meet pre-surgery testing needs.
 We believe our decentralized PCR-quality solution also meets the following long-term healthcare provider needs:
  
• | Enables PCR-quality testing in remote areas such rural hospital networks and IDNs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Solves need for surge capacity testing without investments in or anchors to durable equipment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14



 
• | Serves as a PCR-quality trusted testing solution for healthcare system employers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provides a differentiated testing pathway for high-risk patient populations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The urgency of COVID-19 has accelerated our sales organization’s ability to build relationships with providers in the U.S. healthcare system. These efforts create a foundation for new products we plan to introduce including the COVID-19/flu combo test, which is currently undergoing validation and clinical studies. We believe that COVID-19 has changed physician and patient attitudes towards diagnostic testing and that in the future, both groups will expect to test before treating influenza-like illness.  
 We plan to drive adoption of our solutions by U.S. healthcare providers through our direct sales professionals, distribution partners, promotion of our test kits and our online prescription store, creating awareness through our key opinion leader advisory panel, and through additional direct marketing efforts by our sales and marketing team.   
 U.S. Business to Business and Government  
 After receiving EUA authorization for our OTC test kit in the United States, we began selling our tests to both employers and government organizations and refer to this as our business-to-business segment. This customer segment tends to operate in industries with highly compensated and skilled workers.  Frequently these business customers employ sophisticated medical or health officers focused exclusively on maintaining a healthy work environment for their elite workforce. These business customers tend to employ an infrastructure that focuses on employee and workplace health continuously and independent of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe these businesses will continue to appreciate the ongoing need for testing because their infrastructure appreciates that employees will continue to present with flu-like symptoms and diagnostics will be needed to differentiate infection for the health of the employee and the business. Business sectors that employ this type of employee health infrastructure include technology, financial services, entertainment and professional sports. Our tests have facilitated back to work strategies despite the lack of any government driven regulation requiring testing of any kind.  
 We believe these sophisticated business segment customers select our PCR-quality test kits after a deliberate and highly informed decision process.  They continue to choose our solution because antigen and central lab testing does not meet their need for accuracy and on-the-spot results.  We believe their appetite for our solution will continue after the COVID-19 pandemic becomes endemic because of their need to keep their highly skilled workforce in the workplace and to keep their businesses running at maximum efficiency. We believe that our business customers in this stratum are well positioned to seek long term supplies of our combo COVID/flu test, which is currently undergoing validation and clinical studies.   
 We employ a direct sales force to target and maintain these business customer relationships.  Additionally, we may partner with certain business customers to offer our test kits to their employees through direct marketing campaigns in partnership with their employer who is our business customer.    
 Additionally, several sophisticated governmental organizations with operational similarities to elite business have sought our differentiated solutions.  We service these governments with strategies similar to our business customers and believe their demand will be durable for the same reasons as our business customers.  
 Direct to Consumer 
 
Our direct-to-consumer, or DTC sales and marketing team sells our OTC test kits directly to the individual consumer through our website, through Amazon and through our value-added reseller partners. Our online platforms offer fast delivery, in most cases next day. We believe that our individual customers primarily chose our test kits in 2021 to confirm negative diagnosis. In 2022 and beyond, we believe our direct consumer sales will be driven by consumer desire to test for the purpose of seeking treatment. Through our direct marketing campaigns via online, email and social media, we plan to continue to make consumers aware of our ability to identify infection earlier than antigen testing with trusted PCR-quality results. In addition, our value-added reseller partners offer our test kit on 
 15


their online platforms and in certain cases offer proctoring services as well. We believe this channel will help create a new “test to treat” market that will evolve from the “test to confirm negative result” paradigm.
 
Apart from more widely based social media driven marketing campaigns, our LUCI PASS digital solution has a growing database of past users introduced to our test kit platform from our healthcare, business and government customers.  Our sales and marketing team plan to continue to develop directed marketing communications to these past users in a compliant manner, sometimes in collaboration with our institutional customers.
 International
 In 2021, we sold tests into Canada, Taiwan, Singapore, and Israel. During 2022, and in future years we expect to incrementally add new countries and regions, if and when we receive regulatory approval. There are three components of these approvals that we are working towards including non-emergency approval, and the ability to promote our tests as a PCR-equivalent.  
 In these international regions, we plan to continue to deploy our strategy of leveraging distributors.  We believe that selecting, managing and educating distributors will cultivate a market reflecting our U.S. success.  We plan to do so while leveraging local distributors’ knowledge and customer relationships to address the specialized needs found in widely varying international locales. Local and regional international distributors will be supported by sales and marketing managers hired in geographic proximity to our distributors.  We plan to select and establish long term distribution agreements with local experts to drive the emerging test to treat paradigm our technology allows.  All while enabling local distributors to innovate methods for accessing their particular local market needs.  
 We may not be able to meet all the demand for each new market we enter.  Where possible we plan to establish travel and healthcare use cases with major customers first, then expand to other users and customer segments over time. 
 
Clinical Performance and Data 
 Our Robust Clinical Data
 Our first clinical trial was conducted among symptomatic individuals and demonstrated the molecular accuracy of our COVID-19 test kit as comparable to the known high sensitivity Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay, or Hologic Panther Fusion. This clinical trial was initiated in September 2020 and supported our first EUA. The Hologic Panther Fusion is a high sensitivity molecular assay due to its low LoD as labeled in its EUA. In this clinical trial, we collected samples from 101 individuals, tested the samples head-to-head against the Hologic Panther Fusion and achieved 94.1% positive percent agreement (96.0% with discrepant testing) and 98.0% negative percent agreement. Our strong clinical performance was enabled by our LoD of 900 copies per mL of viral transfer media equivalent, or cps / mL VTM equivalent, which allows our COVID-19 test kit to detect viral genetic material in orders of magnitude better than antigen tests. In addition, our COVID-19 test kit is easy-to-use. Specifically, 100% of individuals successfully performed self-testing at-home using our COVID-19 test kit in less than two minutes in a human usability study we conducted with 398 individuals at research facilities in Sunnyvale and Fresno, California. The measure for successful performance was the ability to collect a nasal specimen and start the test running on the first try, either without having to look back at the directions or with only one look back. On November 17, 2020, we received an EUA from the FDA for (1) prescription at-home use with self-collected nasal swab specimens in individuals aged 14 and older who are suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider and (2) use at the POC, with self-collected nasal swab specimens in individuals aged 14 and older, and in individuals aged 13 and under when the specimen is collected by a healthcare provider at the POC.  Our test kit was the first FDA-authorized, under an EUA, COVID-19 test that allows patients to test themselves and receive results at home.  Our prescription at-home use indication does not require healthcare provider telehealth or video observation.
 In December 2020, we initiated a follow-on clinical trial among asymptomatic individuals to support both a new EUA submission for OTC non-prescription use, as well as an EUA amendment to our initial EUA to 
 16


expand the indicated population to include asymptomatic individuals.  We refer to our clinical trial among symptomatic individuals and our follow-up clinical trial among asymptomatic individuals as our Community Testing Studies.  The asymptomatic study enrolled a total of 303 individuals, including 81 asymptomatic positives, and again utilized the Hologic Panther Fusion as the comparator. Results of the follow-on asymptomatic study showed no statistical difference in our test performance compared to the first study among symptomatic individuals. Hence, simply increasing the sample and confidence in our molecular accuracy as compared to the known high sensitivity Hologic Panther Fusion assay.  Our accuracy across both Community Testing Studies as compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion was 96% across all 404 samples.  Our sensitivity, or positive percent agreement PPA, was 92% across all 132 positive samples.  Excluding samples with very low levels of virus that possibly were no longer infectious, our sensitivity, or PPA was 97%. Our specificity, or negative percent agreement NPA across both studies was 98%.
 We have conducted a number of clinical trials to support our clinical performance as well as aggregate real-world patient data in order to support our initial FDA EUA application, which we filed on October 22, 2020, and our initial EUA for our COVID-19 test kit, which we received from the FDA on November 17, 2020. Subsequently, we completed a follow-on Community Testing study under the same protocol as the prior study used to submit our first EUA to include asymptomatic individuals. This data was submitted to FDA to support the expansion of our POC and prescription at-home EUA to include asymptomatic individuals and was also used to support a new EUA submission for OTC non-prescription use. Based on our clinical work completed to-date, we believe that our COVID-19 test kit shows the following key attributes: 
  
• | Real world data supporting on-the-spot testing, portability and clinical utility.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecular accuracy performance on-par with known high sensitivity PCR centralized laboratory tests.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High usability across a broad population set including age.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

Real World Data Supporting On-The-Spot Testing, Portability and Clinical Utility 
 Community Testing Studies 
 We have now completed two clinical trials, which we call our Community Testing Studies, to establish the clinical performance of our COVID-19 test kit under the intended use conditions. The first Community Testing Study was conducted among symptomatic individuals and was used to support the our first EUA submission.  The second Community Testing Study was conducted as a follow-on study among asymptomatic individuals and was used as a basis to support the most recent EUA submissions.  In the symptomatic study, we enrolled COVID-19 known positive patients as well as symptomatic people not experiencing fever so long as they were experiencing at least three CDC COVID-19 symptoms and at least one symptom was either cough, shortness of breath and/or new loss of taste or smell. In the asymptomatic study, only asymptomatic subjects were enrolled.  Across both studies, subjects were tested outside their residence, and in the asymptomatic study, some tests were performed at a pop-up study clinic.  All enrolled subjects independently collected their nasal swab samples and ran our test. All subjects then collected a second nasal swab sample that was run in Sutter Health Shared Labs and the results were compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion. 
 A total of 404 subjects were enrolled across both of our Community Testing Studies. Our COVID-19 test kit achieved 92% (121/132) positive percent agreement, or PPA as compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion across all samples, and a 96% PPA (49/51) with discrepant testing.  Excluding samples with very low levels of virus that possibly no longer represented active infection (10 samples with cycle thresholds greater than 37.5 Ct), we achieved a 97% (118/122) PPA.  The Ct value is the number of cycles required to detect the viral target, and running more cycles (a higher Ct value) reflects detection of a lower amount of viral material. The 95% confidence intervals, or CI, for the total PPA were 85.5% to 98.4%. 
 Our negative percent agreement, or NPA, was 98%. The 95% CI for the total NPA were 89.4% to 99.9%. There was one invalid result in this trial (0.99%) that resulted in a retest, and two additional retests (1.98%) that were due to user errors where study staff prematurely provided a second test kit prior to letting the test complete 
 17


to a possible invalid result. The following table summarizes the results of our Community Testing Studies using the Hologic Panther Fusion as a comparator: 
 
 
 | Total Subjects | Subjects with Ct ≤ 37.5
 | PPA | NPA | Accuracy | PPA | NPA | Accuracy 
Symptomatic | 94% (48/51) | 98% (49/50) | 96% (97/101) | 100% (45/45) | 98% (49/50) | 99% (94/95) 
Asymptomatic | 90% (73/81) | 98% (218/222) | 96% (291/303) | 95% (73/77) | 98% (218/222) | 97% (291/299)
Total | 92% (121/132) | 98% (267/272) | 96% (388/404) | 97% (118/122) | 98% (267/272) | 98% (385/394)

 
The graph below depicts our PPA summary from our Community Testing Studies comparing our COVID-19 test kit head-to-head to our FDA EUA authorized high sensitivity comparator, the Hologic Panther Fusion. The graph below shows Ct values of reference positive samples from our Community Testing Studies. Green color is used to show that our test result matched the Hologic Panther Fusion positive result. Grey color is used to show that our test result did not match the Hologic Panther Fusion reference test result. Ct values are shown in ascending order. 
 

Clinical Usability Data from our Community Testing Studies 
 Our Community Testing Studies also included usability measures in both their case reporting form to record swabbing attributes, as well as a patient questionnaire to assess overall usability and instructions clarity. Usability results from both our Community Testing Studies demonstrate that our COVID-19 test kit is easy to use and that 100% of enrolled subjects have been able to successfully run our COVID-19 test kit. Our Community Testing Study usability data is in line with our prior human usability study results, where approximately 96% of 
 18


subjects stated that our COVID-19 test kit was “Easier or About What They Expected” and approximately 92% of subjects stated our instructions manual was “Extremely or Very Clear and Understandable.” 
 Performance Summary 
 Results from our Community Testing Studies were submitted to support our FDA EUA applications for our COVID-19 test kit. The Community Testing Studies, which utilized the Hologic Panther Fusion as a comparator assay, achieved a 92% (121/132) PPA calculated across all samples and 97% (118/122) PPA achieved among all samples at or below the Ct value of 37.5. These results exceeded the FDA template objective of greater than 80% PPA for prescription at-home and POC use and greater that 90% PPA for OTC use. While our 98% (267/272) NPA was slightly below the FDA template of 99% NPA objective, the result is comparable to the reported NPA for many other EUA-authorized assays. 
 Moreover, all clinical data for our COVID-19 test kit were gathered in prospective trials conducted outside of clinical settings, which simulated the real-world use conditions. Therefore, the performance data obtained in these clinical trials are expected to be representative of the assay performance in the field. 
 Further, the Community Testing Studies demonstrated that our COVID-19 test kit can easily and successfully be used by untrained users in a home and non-laboratory setting. With the exception of three senior living residents over the age of 80, all of the enrolled subjects in the Community Testing Studies used our COVID-19 test kit on their own, using our instructions manual provided with our COVID-19 test kit. In our symptomatic study, many of these users were noticeably symptomatic and not feeling well and all of them conducted this test standing outside their residence. In addition, we have worked with nearly 1,000 users to optimize our COVID-19 test kit workflow and instructions manual. 
 
Cleveland Clinic Clinical Trial
 We sponsored a study with Cleveland Clinic Florida from August 2020 to April 2021. The criteria for participation in the study included: 1) 18 years of age or older; 2) COVID-19 symptomatic subjects currently experiencing fever of 100 degrees or higher or self-reports of having fever in the past 48 hours and currently experiencing at least one additional associated CDC COVID-19 symptom or previously tested positive for COVID-19; and 3) willingness to try COVID-19 test and self-collect nasal swab samples in both nostrils. A total of 97 subjects were enrolled and completed the study, of which, 90 subjects’ samples were analyzed as there was CDC comparator data available for 90 subjects.
 The Cleveland Clinic Clinical Trial was completed and results reported in October 2021. The primary objective of the study was to confirm our COVID-19 All-in One test kit provides similar performance to a central lab-based FDA EUA molecular diagnostic RT-PCR assay with known high sensitivity. In the study, our COVID-19 test kit results were compared to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel Assay with the final results summarized in the following:
 
 
 | Comparators | 
---------------------------------+-------------+---------
Our COVID-19 Test Kit | Positive | Negative | Total
Positive | 58 | 1 | 59 
Negative | 2 | 29 | 31 
Total | 60 | 30 | 90 
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) | | | 97% 
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) | | | 97% 

 The secondary objective was to demonstrate our COVID-19 test kit is suitable for patient use and does not require a health care professional to administer. The following summarizes the post-testing survey results from the 97 subjects enrolled in the study:
 19


 
• | 100% of subjects reported that their overall experience was easier or about what they expected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of subjects reported that the swab ease of use and instructions of use were easier or about what they expected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 93% of subjects reported that the overall instructions were extremely or very clear and understandable, 6% expressed somewhat clear and understandable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 96% of subjects reported that they were very or extremely likely to stay home to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others if they knew they were infectious; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 99% of subjects reported that it was important for them that an at-home COVID-19 test kit be made available.

Molecular Accuracy Performance On-Par with Centralized Laboratory Tests 
 Limit of Detection—Analytical Sensitivity 
 As previously described, LoD is the defining measure of an assay’s ability to reliably detect the presence of a specific target, such as viral RNA or protein. It is defined as the lowest target concentration at which the assay is able to generate a positive result more than 95% of the time. Molecular assays tend to have lower LoD, which equates to higher sensitivity resulting from their nucleic amplification. This provides a significant sensitivity or LoD advantage compared to antigen tests which do not amplify or multiply the viral sample. 
 The chart below shows the distribution of LoDs among 185 FDA-authorized molecular assays on a cps / mL VTM equivalent basis. The most accurate molecular assays have an LoD of 1,000 or less cps / mL VTM equivalent basis. While our COVID-19 test kit utilizes a direct swab method whereby the swab goes directly into the sample vial and does not require VTM, our LoD is 900 cps / mL VTM equivalent, placing it among one of the most accurate molecular assays currently available. Our LoD, like other high-performing, known high-sensitivity molecular assays, is also significantly more sensitive than antigen assays. Plot points higher in the graph are lower LoD which is more sensitive and considered more accurate.

(1) | The FDA’s EUA regulatory environment for COVID-19 tests is rapidly changing. This chart references data as of November 2020 with the exception of the addition of prescription at-home and OTC sample-to-result tests authorized through March 15, 2021.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To support our LoD for our FDA EUA submission, we followed the FDA’s template guidance for calculating LoD. Quantified heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus was serially diluted in a natural nasal swab matrix, 35 µL was pipetted onto a fresh, unused nasal swab and run on two test kit lots. The LoD for the test kit was determined by testing three target concentrations on each lot of test kits. For each lot, each concentration was tested in replicates of seven test kits by three unique operators, for a total of 21 replicates per concentration. The LoD for each lot was separately determined as the lowest concentration of genome copy equivalents per swab that yielded greater than 95% positive results. The preliminary LoD for the test kit was defined as the highest LoD of the two lots. 
 The following table summarizes our LoD data submitted to the FDA: 
 
 
Genome Equivalent / Swab (per reaction) | | Positive/Total Valid | Percent Positive | 
----------------------------------------+-------+----------------------+-------------------+------------------
 | | | Preliminary Lot 1 | Preliminary Lot 2 | Confirmatory | Preliminary Lot 1 | | Preliminary Lot 2 | | Confirmatory
2,700(1) | | 20/21 | 20/21 | 20/20 | 95.2% | | 95.2% | | 100% | 
 | 1,350 | | 18/21 | 20/21 | — | 85.7% | | 95.2% | | — 


(1) | 2,700 cp / swab is determined as LoD and is equivalent to 900 cps / mL of VTM equivalent assuming 100% elution of the swab in 3 mL of VTM.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The LoD for Lot 1 was determined to be 2,700 copies per swab, while Lot 2 was 1,350 copies per swab. As such, 2,700 copies per swab was reported as the preliminary LoD. The LoD was confirmed by testing 20 replicates at the preliminary LoD concentration on a single lot. All 20 of 20 test kits at this concentration were positive. 
 High Usability Across a Broad Population Set 
 Overview and Methodology 
 In addition to our Community Testing Studies, we conducted an FDA EUA human usability study among a total sample of 398 healthy, non-symptomatic users to evaluate the ability of various ages, ethnicities and education levels to successfully run our COVID-19 test kit. This usability work was completed across two clinical trials as a second trial to include parent-assisted collections of minors was added after reviewing the FDA template published on July 29, 2020. 
 Prior to these usability studies, we conducted extensive usability work involving nearly 500 people in five locations and three states (California, North Carolina, and Ohio) in the beginning of 2020. These prior studies provided an opportunity to optimize our COVID-19 test kit workflow and instructions manual prior to conducting the FDA EUA human usability study to support our EUA for our COVID-19 test kit.

 Overall, we achieved the FDA EUA submission human usability study endpoints among all English-speaking subjects aged 14 and older. The only age cohort that did not sufficiently meet the desired length of time swabbing during self-collection endpoint were younger teens aged 12 to 13, and this age cohort was not included in the first EUA indicated population for self-collection for prescription at-home use.

Usability Endpoint 1: Ability to Follow the Instructions to Start Our COVID-19 Test Kit 
 Our human usability study showed 100% of users aged 14 and above were able to follow the instructions to start the test running (successfully perform our COVID-19 test kit from beginning to end), exceeding the 95% endpoint objective. These results demonstrate our COVID-19 test kit can be performed by untrained users of a broad range of ages. These results are further corroborated by additional ease of use and instructions clarity data with respect to our proposed instructions manual as follows: 

• | 97% (340/352) rated their experience as “Easier or About What They Expected”.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nearly 100% of users rated the overall test kit instructions (351/352) as sufficient to be able to understand how to perform the test.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 94% of users (330/352) rated the instructions as “Extremely or Very Clear” and only one 12-year old user (1/352) rated the instructions as “Not Very or Not At All Clear” (bottom two scores on a 1-5 scale).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | After using our COVID-19 test kit, 100% (352/352) of users across all age cohorts expressed confidence they could run the test at-home on their own.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usability Endpoint 2: Test Results Interpretation 
 We conducted test results interpretation among adults only. Teens were not asked to interpret results as we expected that parents or guardians would be involved in the interpretation of the test results for minors. For this portion of the usability study, users were shown all three possible test results—positive, negative and invalid—in randomized order and asked to interpret each result. An invalid result is the term to describe a result that cannot be interpreted as being either “positive” or “negative.” Invalid results occur when a sample cannot be read or interpreted. They do not mean that a device has malfunctioned or failed, but rather are events that are known and expected to occur with in-vitro diagnostic tests. When an invalid result occurs, the patient needs to have a new sample tested. 
 The image below shows the display sample we asked our subjects to interpret. We achieved 100% test results interpretation accuracy. 
 

Usability Endpoint 3: Quality Nasal Swab Self-Collection 
 We studied two objectives related to our third endpoint – obtaining a quality nasal swab self-collection. The first objective was related to swabbing both nostrils. Our usability study results showed 99% of adults aged 18 and older, 98% of parents collecting on their children and 95% of teens aged 14 to 17 achieved the first objective of this endpoint. 
 The second objective was related to swabbing time. Adults aged 18 and older exceeded this objective of having a total swabbing time in both nostrils of at least 10 seconds, with 92% of adults having a swabbing time of at least 11 seconds and a median swabbing time of 18 seconds. Teens aged 14 to 17 were very close on this endpoint 
 22


with 92% of older teens having a swabbing time of 9 seconds and a median swabbing time of 17 seconds.  Parents also were very close on this endpoint with 90% of parents having a child collection swabbing time of 9 seconds and a median swabbing time of 13 seconds.
 This swabbing data which shows that users were successfully able to self-collect a nasal swab sample is further corroborated by the following additional usability study data: 
  
• | 99% of users rated the swab step instructions (348/352) as sufficient to be able to understand how to do the swab step.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 95% of users rated the swab step as “Not Very or Not At All Hard” (easiest two responses on a 1-5 scale).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our most recent FDA OTC EUA submission includes adult collections in children ages two to 13.  We had provided this parent collection data to FDA with our first EUA submission in November 2020. However, we did not seek an adult/parent collection indication in children with our first prescription at-home EUA. The FDA views our parent collection usability data as sufficient to support the adult/parent collection in children ages two to 13 in our OTC EUA submission and did not require any additional usability study data beyond what was included in our initial FDA EUA submission. Our usability study demonstrated that parents were successfully able to collect a nasal swab sample among the 52 parents enrolled in our usability study as described above.
 Previous Clinical Development 
 In the fall of 2019, we submitted to the FDA a dual 510(k) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, waiver submission for an influenza test kit based on clinical trials conducted in June 2018 in Santiago Chile and during the 2018 to 2019 influenza season in the United States. Applying discrepant analysis, both studies showed strong assay performance with specificity and sensitivity for influenza A and B viruses at or above 95%. However, there were two issues that led us to eventually withdraw our submission. First, the comparator did not detect influenza virus A as well as our assay did, thus negatively and artificially lowering our influenza virus A specificity to 92% in the study. When applying discrepant resolution, our influenza virus A specificity improved to 97%. Running this study with a single comparator that did not correctly identify at least 35 specimens as true positives hindered our ability to obtain a CLIA waiver clearance because the FDA threshold for specificity is 95%. Second, there was a higher than anticipated rate of invalids at nearly 10%. Root cause analysis showed greater than half of the invalids were related to prototype manufacturing quality issues and, importantly, were not related to fundamental assay performance. We believe these issues have since been resolved and our influenza assay’s invalid rate is now less than 5%. After receiving an additional information letter from the FDA in January 2020 primarily regarding these issues, we withdrew our submission and turned our focus to COVID-19 assay development. 
 The following table shows our influenza clinical data from our 2018 and 2019 clinical trials in Chile and the United States.

Manufacturing and Supply
 We leverage a combination of internal and external manufacturing capabilities to manufacture the various components of our finished test kit. We have chosen to partner with Jabil, a leading global manufacturing solutions provider offering capacity expansion, sourcing expertise, and automation capabilities. We plan to make additional investments to increase capacity through automation and expansion of our manufacturing footprint through our outsourced manufacturer. We created an equipment and process platform with the capability to be systematically replicated in a short time period to expand manufacturing capacity.  In 2021 we partnered with Jabil to enable significant manufacturing expansion and scale up including in the Dominican Republic. In the future we intend to primarily rely on third-party suppliers to manufacture our test kits. Outsourcing to third parties provides us expertise and capacity necessary to scale up or down based on demand for our test kits. We have started to see increased scale due to our 2021 efforts with Jabil. We continue to investigate opportunities to enhance manufacturing capacity and efficiency to align with anticipated demand. 
 Many of the critical components are dual sourced with alternate suppliers identified and qualified. We have sourced and will continue to source test kit components, molds, reagents and other test kit materials from a limited number of suppliers or, in many cases, a single supplier. For example, our molds and many of our reagents are sole-sourced. In addition, we rely solely on Promega Corporation and New England BioLabs, Inc. for the supply of our current enzymes and primers. We intend to put in place framework agreements with certain of our single-source suppliers, including Promega Corporation and New England BioLabs, Inc., under which third-party contract manufacturers and/or suppliers will generally provide us with necessary quantities of such materials based on our development and commercial needs. We continuously assess our lack of redundant supply for our current enzymes and primers in particular to protect against any potential supply disruptions. Our modular manufacturing approach coupled with our agile supply chain would provide us the flexibility to scale in-house with any partner. 
 Our manufacturing process and Jabil’s facilities and manufacturing processes are designed to comply with FDA’s Quality Systems Requirements and enable us to market our COVID-19 test kit into the clinical diagnostics and testing markets. Jabil operates its facilities in conformance with a variety of International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, certifications, with most of our healthcare facilities’ quality management systems meeting ISO 13485. We are licensed by the State of California to manufacture and distribute our test kits. 
 Manufacturing Services Agreement with Jabil 
 On September 10, 2020, we entered into the Jabil MSA with Jabil, pursuant to which Jabil will manufacture, test, pack and ship certain electronic assemblies and systems in accordance with our specifications. Jabil may not subcontract any of its manufacturing services under the Jabil MSA without our prior written consent. We are obligated to provide, on a monthly basis, a rolling 12-month forecast to Jabil as well as 12-months of historical aggregate end customer demand at the finished product level, which will be used to constitute written purchase orders from us, and we are obligated to purchase the quantity of products that is required by the first four months of each forecast. Jabil is entitled to reject any purchase orders that are not placed in accordance with the forecast. 
 We are obligated to pay Jabil upon issuance of a purchase order based on a volume pricing matrix, pursuant to which Jabil will review the actual purchases during the then-ending quarter and compare against the forecasted orders in the upcoming quarter. If Jabil determines that the actual purchases correspond to a different pricing band in the volume pricing matrix, Jabil will either issue (a) a credit for any excess price paid by us if the actual price is lower than the invoiced price or (b) an invoice for any shortfall if the actual price is higher than the invoiced price. Jabil may adjust the volume pricing matrix to reflect changes in costs on the first anniversary of its notice to us that production qualification can commence, or after the addition of new equipment or labor. 
 The agreement is for an initial term of three years and automatically renewed for successive periods of one year, subject to either party’s notice of intent not to renew, delivered at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term. The Jabil MSA may be terminated at any time upon the mutual written consent of the parties. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by either party (a) at will upon at least 180 days’ written notice to the other party, (b) for cause based on a material breach by the other party, subject to a 30-day cure period and (c) for certain bankruptcy or insolvency events enumerated under the agreement. 
 24


Technology Services Agreement with Jabil 
 On September 10, 2020, we also entered into a technology services agreement, or the Jabil TSA, with Jabil, pursuant to which Jabil will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform certain technical services related to the development of components, assemblies and systems in relation to each project under the agreement as set forth in one or more statement of work, which may include our COVID-19 test kit and any of our future product candidates. 
 We are obligated to pay Jabil all amounts as set forth in each statement of work, which will specify the timeline and schedule for the performance of each service, the compensation to be paid by us to Jabil and other relevant terms and conditions. 
 After the initial term of three years, the Jabil TSA will automatically be renewed for successive periods of one year unless a party provides the other party with notice of its intention not to renew the agreement at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the then current term. Either party may terminate the Jabil TSA at any time upon the mutual written consent of both parties. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by either party (a) at will upon at least 180 days’ written notice to the other party, (b) for cause based on a material breach by the other party, subject to a 60-day cure period and (c) for certain bankruptcy or insolvency events enumerated under the agreement. 
 Reporting 
 In order to facilitate the rapid and thorough public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act requires every laboratory that performs or analyzes a test that is intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19 to report the results from each such test to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. The CARES Act also authorized the HHS Secretary to identify the form and manner, as well as the timing and frequency, of such reporting. Based on subsequent guidance issued by the HHS on June 4, 2020, all laboratories, including testing locations operating as temporary overflow or remote locations for a laboratory, and other facilities or locations performing testing at POC or with at-home specimen collection related to SARS-CoV-2, will report data for all testing completed, for each individual tested, within 24 hours of results being known or determined, on a daily basis to the appropriate state or local public health department based on the individual’s residence. 
 In the POC setting and with our prescription at-home product, health care providers will be responsible for test results reporting to public health agencies according to federal, state and local regulations.  To facilitate this reporting, we expect to provide two methods to facilitate such reporting, including through an on-package photo guide that would allow users to upload results to secure physician portals and through a dedicated physician HIPAA compliant web-based test results reporting portal. 
 For OTC, we have developed LUCI PASS as referenced above, and is designed to allow users to easily receive a verified test result transmit their test result to the relevant public health authorities.
 Reimbursement 
 Coverage and reimbursement for our COVID-19 test kit will vary by setting of care, payor type, and region. In the United States, healthcare providers that purchase our COVID-19 test kits will likely look to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, private commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, accountable care organization, or ACOs, and other healthcare-related organizations, to cover and pay for the COVID-19 test kits. Sales volumes and prices of our COVID-19 test kits will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors. 
 The CARES Act provides coverage for FDA EUA authorized COVID-19 tests when such tests are medically appropriate and ordered by a healthcare provider. Presently, COVID-19 testing coverage exists for tests run in clinical labs and POC settings. Under the EUA we received, our COVID-19 test kit is eligible for reimbursement in POC settings as a molecular POC test. Further, beginning January 15, 2022, pursuant to guidance issued by the Biden administration, health plans are required to provide coverage for at-home COVID-19 testing 
 25


during the public health emergency without imposing any cost-sharing requirements (including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance), prior authorization, or other medical management requirements. Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible for free at home COVID-19 testing in the spring of 2022.
 CMS covers medically appropriate COVID-19 testing and currently reimburses $100 for high throughput laboratory tests to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus if they return results within two days, $75 for such high throughput laboratory tests that take longer than two days to return results, $51 for such tests when not performed in high throughput laboratories (which would include our COVID-19 test kit) and around $42 for antibody tests. However, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to ensure profitability. We have active engagement with the relevant federal agencies regarding reimbursement status of our test. We continue to explore and enhance our coverage efforts with public and private payors. 
 For our POC indication, we expect to receive payment directly from POC customers and to not directly bill any third-party payors. For POC use, the success of our COVID-19 test kits will depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our COVID-19 test kits will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and management healthcare organizations. These third-party payors decide which products will be covered and establish reimbursement levels for those products. 
 Competition 
 The diagnostic testing industry, especially for COVID-19, is highly competitive, and given the significant interest and growth in COVID-19 related diagnostic tests, we expect ongoing intense competition from different sources, including from manufacturers and producers of diagnostic tests, vaccines and therapeutic treatments. 
 In diagnostic testing, we anticipate facing competition from companies that have or are developing molecular tests (including centralized laboratory and POC tests) as well as antigen and antibody tests.  We plan to continue to compete with testing solutions provided by centralized labs for COVID-19 and influenza. Large lab companies like Quest Diagnostics, Inc. and Laboratory Corporation of America have also expanded beyond centralized laboratory testing into home sample collection. We also will face competition from POC testing solutions, whether for influenza, COVID-19 or a combination.  In the at-home setting, we will face continued competition from COVID-19 antigen tests because they are rapid and are already in use across the United States and internationally.  We are not yet aware of any at-home influenza test, or COVID-19/flu combo test, whether molecular or antigen.  However, we believe such tests are under development. Finally, we face competition from companies focused on developing and commercializing molecular testing in the home.  These companies include Cue Health, Inc. and Detect, Inc., which have both received EUA for molecular COVID-19 testing (POC and at-home).  We face potential competition from many other sources, including academic institutions, public and private research institutions and governmental agencies. As of February 18, 2022, 420 tests and sample collection devices were authorized by the FDA under EUAs, including EUAs for 15 antigen OTC at-home tests and 3 molecular OTC at-home tests.
 Many of the companies against which we currently are competing or which we may compete with in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical development, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved test kits than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We expect competition to continue to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the market, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products, services and technologies are introduced. Moreover, the entrance of new competitors is being encouraged by governmental authorities, which are offering significant funding to support development of testing solutions for COVID-19, which solutions may be relevant diagnostic 
 26


testing for other infectious disease states. Some of our existing or new competitors may have strong relationships with current and potential customers, including governmental authorities, and, as a result, may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing regulatory requirements, new or emerging technologies, and changes in customer requirements. Our COVID-19 test kit may not compete favorably, and we may not be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and technologies introduced by our existing competitors or new companies entering our markets. Any failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Our success is contingent in part upon the successful development and commercialization of our COVID-19 test kit and our other assays from our platform that prove to be more effective and convenient than competing products in our target indications. We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that provide faster time to results, are more convenient or are less expensive than our COVID-19 test kit or any other test kits that we may develop. Our competitors also may be quicker and/or more successful than us in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals for their products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how, including our COVID-19 test kit and our influenza test kit, as well as our LAMP technology and any of our future test kits; to defend and enforce our patents; to operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or violating our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we own or license or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our test kits and technology. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Part I. Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in this Annual Report.
 As of March 7, 2022, we owned seven issued U.S. utility patents, nine pending U.S. utility patent applications, ten issued foreign patents and 44 pending foreign patent applications. Our molecular diagnostic platform is covered by six issued U.S. method and device patents, which include claims directed at methods and compositions for carrying out the molecular diagnostic assays on our platform and device claims covering our molecular diagnostic platform device. Additionally, we owned nine pending U.S. patent applications covering aspects of the device and composition used to run our molecular diagnostic assays, including those for COVID-19 and influenza. The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. Our issued U.S. and foreign patents are anticipated to naturally expire between 2035 and 2038, and our U.S. pending patent applications and pending PCT application, if issued into patents, are anticipated to naturally expire between 2035 and 2041, excluding any additional patent term adjustment(s) or extension(s), and assuming payment of all applicable maintenance or annuity fees. Once a patent expires, patent protection ends and an invention enters the public domain allowing anyone to commercially exploit the invention without infringing the patent.
 
In addition, we hold design patents and patent applications that cover certain ornamental features of our platform device. As of March 7, 2022, we owned two issued U.S. design patents, two allowed U.S. design patent applications, one pending U.S. design patent application, 32 foreign design registrations, and two pending foreign design applications. Our issued U.S. design patents, allowed U.S. design patent applications, and pending U.S. design patent applications, if issued into design patents, are anticipated to naturally expire between 2035 and 2037. Our foreign design registrations are anticipated to naturally expire between 2030 and 2045.
 27


We cannot guarantee that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop methods or devices that are not covered by our patents or circumvent these patents. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which our test kits compete. Because patent applications can take many years to publish, there may be applications unknown to us, which may result in issued patents that our existing or future products or technologies may be alleged to infringe. 
 There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. We may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Furthermore, even if our patents are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages or ongoing royalties. Such monetary compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer’s competition in the market. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using the product determined to be infringing, any of which could harm our business. See Part I. Item IA, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in this Annual Report for additional information regarding these and other risks related to our intellectual property portfolio. 
 We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand. As of March 12, 2022, we own two U.S. trademark registrations, two allowed intent-to-use US trademark applications, one pending trademark application in Canada, and two international registrations through the Madrid Protocol in New Zealand and Hong Kong. . We also rely, in part, on unpatented trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and confidential information, to develop and maintain our competitive position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. However, such proprietary rights are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and assignment agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have implemented measures to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our test kits or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Part I. Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in this Annual Report.
 License Agreement with Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. 
 In July 2020, we entered into a patent license agreement, or the Eiken Agreement, with Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., or Eiken. Pursuant to the terms of the Eiken Agreement, Eiken granted us a non-transferable, non-assignable, sublicensable (to our affiliates), non-exclusive license under certain patents, which we refer to collectively as the Eiken Licensed Patents, relating, in part, to loop-mediated isothermal amplification, or LAMP, to develop, make, use, sell, offer for sale and dispose of any reagent, product, kit, device, equipment and/or system for nucleic acid-based in-vitro diagnostic tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, which we collectively refer to as the Initial Licensed Products, in the United States. We also have limited have-made rights with respect to the Eiken Licensed Patents. 
 Under the terms of the Eiken Agreement, we have an option to expand the license to the Eiken Licensed Patents for the Initial Licensed Products outside of the United States for a payment of additional fees. In April 2021, we paid the first installment of the world-wide license in the amount of $9 thousand. The second installment for the 
 28


world-wide license of $9 thousand was paid in July 2021. In addition, we also have an option to expand the license to the Eiken Licensed Patents for new targets beyond the purpose of testing COVID-19 in the United States, which we collectively refer to as the Additional Licensed Products, and together with the Initial Licensed Products, the Licensed Products, for a payment of a one-time fee for each Additional Licensed Product and an additional fee for the expansion of the licensed territory outside of the United States for each Additional Licensed Product. As partial consideration of the rights granted to us under the Eiken Agreement, we made an upfront payment to Eiken of $23,778. We also made an additional payment in July 2021 for $24,141(based on the December 31, 2020 conversion ratio of 103.56 yen to one U.S. dollar). In addition, we are obligated to pay a royalty in the low single-digit percentage on total net sales of all Licensed Products.
 On March 8, 2022, we provided notice of termination of the Eiken Agreement. Termination will be effective May 12, 2022. We terminated the Eiken Agreement because certain Eiken Licensed Patents have expired, all of which are locations in which we operate. Following termination of the Eiken Agreement, we will not be required to make any future royalty payments under the Eiken Agreement. 
 Distribution Agreement with Switch 
 On July 14, 2021, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with Switch, which agreement was subsequently amended, or the Distribution Amendment, on December 21, 2021.  Under the Distribution Agreement, we appointed Switch as a non-exclusive distributor for our CHECK IT test kit in Canada and agreed to provide more than two million test kits in 2022.  
 Under the Distribution Agreement, Switch is required to provide us with forecasts of the quantity of test kits that Switch expects to order for each of the coming 12 calendar months through December 2022 and each six-month period following December 2022, each, a Rolling Forecast.  For each calendar month in the Rolling Forecast, Switch is required to purchase at least the quantity of test kits set forth in the Rolling Forecast for such month. 
 If we fail to fulfill the quantity of test kits set forth in any part of the Rolling Forecast for which Switch submits a purchase order(s), then Switch will not be required to purchase the remaining quantity of test kits set forth in the Rolling Forecast.  If Switch fails to purchase the quantity of test kits in any month, or in the aggregate for the 12-month period, in each case as set forth in the Rolling Forecast, then Switch is liable to us for a low double-digit percentage of the total price applicable to the quantity of test kits set forth in the Rolling Forecast for the two months following such failure by Switch.  
 The Distribution Agreement is for a one-year term and either party has the right to renew the Distribution Agreement for successive periods of one-year each by providing written notice to the other party prior to the expiration of the current term. Either party may terminate the Distribution Agreement (a) for uncured material breach by the other party, (b) if the other party enters into insolvency or bankruptcy or a trustee or receiver or the equivalent is appointed for the other party or proceedings are instituted against the other party relating to dissolution, liquidation, winding up, bankruptcy, insolvency, etc. or (c) for convenience upon 30 days’ notice to the other party. Additionally, either party may terminate immediately upon written notice if a regulatory or governmental agency or court takes action the result of which would prohibit or significantly restrict the sale, distribution, use or manufacture of the test kits in accordance with the Distribution Agreement.
 Government Regulation 
 Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States 
 Our product candidates and operations are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, collectively referred to as the FDCA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export and post-marketing surveillance. 
 29


The FDA regulates the development, design, pre-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending premarket applications, issuance of warning letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. 
 FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, or grant of a de novo request for classification. During public emergencies, FDA also may grant emergency use authorizations to allow commercial distribution of devices intended to address the public health emergency. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. Classification of a device is important because the class to which a device is assigned determines, among other things, the necessity and type of FDA review required prior to marketing the device. 
 Class I devices include those with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to the FDA’s “general controls” for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events and malfunctions through the submission of Medical Device Reports, or MDRs, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I or low risk devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. 
 Class II devices are moderate risk devices subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other “special controls” deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, or 510(k), submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous premarketing requirements. 
 Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices and devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device following a 510(k) submission. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by general or special controls. Submission and FDA approval of a PMA application is required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. As with 510(k) submissions, unless an exemption applies, PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is reasonably safe and effective for its intended use and must be supported by extensive data, typically including data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. 
 Emergency Use Authorization 
 In emergency situations, such as a pandemic, the FDA has the authority to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of cleared or approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear warfare threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. 
 30


Under this authority, the FDA may issue an EUA for an unapproved device if the following four statutory criteria have been met: (1) a serious or life-threatening condition exists; (2) evidence of effectiveness of the device exists; (3) a risk-benefit analysis shows that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks; and (4) no other alternatives exist for diagnosing, preventing or treating the disease or condition. Evidence of effectiveness includes medical devices that “may be effective” to prevent, diagnose, or treat the disease or condition identified in a declaration of emergency issued by the Secretary of HHS. The “may be effective” standard for EUAs requires a lower level of evidence than the “effectiveness” standard that FDA uses for product clearances or approvals in non-emergency situations. The FDA assesses the potential effectiveness of a possible EUA product on a case-by-case basis using a risk-benefit analysis. In determining whether the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks, the FDA examines the totality of the scientific evidence to make an overall risk-benefit determination. Such evidence, which could arise from a variety of sources, may include (but is not limited to) results of domestic and foreign clinical trials, in vivo efficacy data from animal models, in vitro data, as well as the quality and quantity of the available evidence. 
 Once granted, an EUA will remain in effect and generally terminate on the earlier of (1) the determination by the Secretary of HHS that the public health emergency has ceased or (2) a change in the approval status of the product such that the authorized use(s) of the product are no longer unapproved. After the EUA is no longer valid, the product is no longer considered to be legally marketed and one of the FDA’s non-emergency premarket pathways would be necessary to resume or continue distribution of the subject product. 
 The FDA also may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. 
 On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19. On February 4, 2020, HHS determined that COVID-19 represents a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad and, subsequently, declared on March 24, 2020, that circumstances exist to justify the authorization of emergency use of medical devices, including alternative products used as medical devices, during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the terms of any authorization as issued by the FDA. On February 29, 2020, the FDA issued an immediately in effect guidance with policy specific to development of in vitro diagnostic tests during the COVID-19 public health emergency, as periodically updated thereafter.
 510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway 
 Our current products are class II and, but for the immediate ability to seek an EUA, would be subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a 510(k) submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, known as a “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (a pre-amendment device), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (1) the same technological characteristics, or (2i) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, by regulation, the FDA has 90 calendar days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance may take and often takes longer. Upon review, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments. 
 Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial 
 31


equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information within 180 days before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. 
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, for example, due to a finding of a lack of a predicate device, that the device has a new intended use or different technological characteristics that raise different questions of safety or effectiveness when the device is compared to the cited predicate device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. If the FDA determines that the information provided in a 510(k) submission is insufficient to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate device, the FDA generally identifies the specific information that needs to be provided so that the FDA may complete its evaluation of substantial equivalence, and such information may be provided within the time allotted by the FDA or in a new 510(k) submission should the original 510(k) submission have been withdrawn. 
 After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacturer documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) submission is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 PMA Approval Pathway 
 Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is reasonably safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review may take and often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. 
 The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical trial that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical trials post-approval. The FDA may also condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. 
 32


Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. None of our test kits are currently approved under a PMA, nor are we currently seeking approval under a PMA for our COVID-19 test kit. However, we may in the future develop devices which will require the approval of a PMA. 
 De novo Classification 
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. To market low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, a manufacturer may request a de novo down-classification. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. A medical device may be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent or a manufacturer may request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. The FDA is required to classify the device within 120 calendar days following receipt of the de novo application, although in practice, the FDA’s review may take significantly longer. During the pendency of the FDA’s review, the FDA may issue an additional information letter, which places the de novo request on hold and stops the review clock pending receipt of the additional information requested. In the event the de novo requestor does not provide the requested information within 180 calendar days, the FDA will consider the de novo request to be withdrawn. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the de novo request for classification if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. In the event the FDA determines the data and information submitted demonstrate that general controls or general and special controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA will grant the de novo request for classification. When the FDA grants a de novo request for classification, the device is granted marketing authorization and further can serve as a predicate for future devices of that type, through a 510(k) premarket notification. 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA, oftentimes for a de novo request for classification, and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must be approved prior to commencing clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, purported or represented to be used in supporting or sustaining human life, is for a use that is substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A clinical trial may begin 30 days after receipt of the IDE by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. 
 33


If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will approve the IDE and, if it is approved, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. 
 In addition, the clinical trials must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. 
 If the device is considered a “non-significant risk,” IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the IRB overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required. Abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements also apply to non-significant risk device studies. 
 During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical trial are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all applicable reporting and record keeping requirements. 
 Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a clinical trial is completed, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical trial will meet the safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval. 
 Post-market Regulation 
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
  
• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers and contract manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements related to promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 34


 
a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections, product removals or recalls if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. In general, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. 
 Manufacturing processes for commercial products are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, design history file, device history records, and complaint files. As manufacturers, we and our contract manufacturers, such as Jabil, will be subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products, which would harm our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our test kits, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. 
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: 
  
• | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | recall, withdrawal, administrative detention or seizure of our test kits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of or delay in granting our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new test kits or modified test kits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 35


 
• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval for our test kits; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Other Privacy Laws 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Healthcare Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or collectively HIPAA, among other things, established federal protection for the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. Under HIPAA, the HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of PHI used or disclosed by “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” and their covered subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and certain healthcare providers. The HIPAA privacy regulations protect PHI by limiting its use and disclosure, giving patients the right to access certain information about them, and limiting most disclosures of PHI to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures. In addition, HIPAA requires covered entities to execute business associate agreements with their business associates and subcontractors, who provide services for or on behalf of covered entities. Business associates have a corresponding obligation to maintain appropriate business associate agreements with downstream subcontractors under HIPAA. 
 In addition, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar data privacy and security laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California’s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. Additionally, we are subject to other data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy and security. Such obligations may include the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, the Canadian Personal Data Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS. In addition, states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act. For example, the CCPA, which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, came into effect on January 1, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. In addition, it is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or the CPRA, effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely, and new data privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. 
 If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, or its implementing regulations, and similar state laws, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. HIPAA has four tiers of civil monetary penalties, as well as criminal penalties, both 
 36


of which may be applied to business associates as well as covered entities, and state attorneys have authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Federal, state, local, and foreign data privacy and security obligations also may include penalties for noncompliance, as well as a private right of action. 
 U.S. Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 The U.S. federal and state governments have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to address fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. 
 Anti-Kickback Statutes 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, order, arrangement for, or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. 
 The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. The government takes the position, and courts have agreed with the government’s interpretation, that the statute’s intent requirement is satisfied if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses, even if there are other legitimate purposes. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in criminal penalties and fines, imprisonment of up to ten years, civil and administrative penalties for each violation, damages, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs like Medicare or Medicaid. A claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA, discussed in greater detail below. 
 There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory “safe harbors” protecting some common activities from prosecution, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance to offer protection. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the HHS, Office of the Inspector General, or the OIG. 
 Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare products or services reimbursed by any source, not only government healthcare programs, and may apply to payments made directly by the patient. 
 Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. 
 Federal False Claims Laws 
 The FCA prohibits any person or entity, among other things, to knowingly present, or cause to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The qui tam provisions of the FCA allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the FCA, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not only a federal healthcare program. 
 37


When an entity is found to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay treble damages and significant mandatory penalties, civil monetary penalties, and may be subject to exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many medical device manufacturers and healthcare companies have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government for a variety of alleged improper activities and have entered into corporate integrity agreements with OIG, under which the companies undertake certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations, to avoid exclusion from federal health care program. The federal government has used the FCA to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks, or in instances in which manufacturers have provided billing or coding advice to providers that the government considered to be inaccurate. In these cases, the manufacturer is subject to liability for “causing” a false claim. In addition, the federal government has pursued companies under the FCA in connection with off-label promotion of products. Our activities, including those relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our test kits (once approved) and the sale and marketing of our test kits (once approved), may be subject to scrutiny under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the FCA. We are also subject to other criminal federal laws that prohibit making false or fictitious claims and false statements to the federal government. 
 While we are unaware of any current investigations or allegations for violations of anti-kickback or false claims laws, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the FCA or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, even if successful or if any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our business as well as our financial performance.

 HIPAA, among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. 
Open Payments 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians, which is defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners), which is defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurate and complete reports may result in substantial monetary penalties. We are subject to the Open Payments Program and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose 
 38


securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring them to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
 U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
 Medicare is a federal program administered by CMS through Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs. Available to people age 65 or over, and certain other people, Medicare provides, among other things, healthcare benefits that cover, within prescribed limits, the major costs of most medically necessary care for such people, subject to certain deductibles and copayments. 
 CMS has established guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain products and procedures by Medicare. In general, in order to be reimbursed by Medicare, a healthcare procedure furnished to a Medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. The methodology for determining coverage status and the amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary received healthcare products and services. The reimbursement rate for certain services, including clinical laboratory services, is established under fee schedules that are developed and periodically updated pursuant to specific statutory or regulatory provisions. Any changes in federal legislation, regulations and policy affecting CMS coverage and reimbursement relative to the procedure using our test kits (once approved) could have a material effect on our performance. 
CMS also administers the Medicaid program, a cooperative federal/state program that provides medical assistance benefits to qualifying low income and medically needy people. State participation in Medicaid is optional, and each state is given discretion in developing and administering its own Medicaid program, subject to certain federal requirements pertaining to payment levels, eligibility criteria and minimum categories of services. The coverage, method and level of reimbursement vary from state to state and is subject to each state’s budget restraints. Changes to the availability of coverage, method or level of reimbursement for relevant procedures may affect future revenue negatively if reimbursement amounts are decreased or discontinued. 
 All CMS programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, intermediary determinations, and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease the rate of program payments to healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers. 
 U.S. Health Reform 
 Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future products once approved. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our test kits profitably once approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our test kits once approved. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our test kits once approved. 
 The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a 2.3% federal excise tax, with limited exceptions, on any entity that manufactures or imports Class I, II and III medical devices offered for sale in the United States that began on January 1, 2013. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019, and was permanently repealed on December 20, 2019 by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. The Affordable Care Act also implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to 
 39


improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain fees mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Further, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and the aforementioned medical device tax, and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the Affordable Care Act will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to CMS payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Various new healthcare reform proposals are emerging at the federal and state level, and additional legislative measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic are expected. For example, beginning January 15, 2022, pursuant to guidance issued by the Biden administration, health plans are required to provide coverage for at-home COVID-19 testing during the public health emergency without imposing any cost-sharing requirements (including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance), prior authorization, or other medical management requirements. Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible for free at home COVID-19 testing in the spring of 2022. We believe that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs and potentially affect individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the rates we will be able to charge for our current and future products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future products from governmental agencies or third-party payors. Current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could harm our business and financial condition.
