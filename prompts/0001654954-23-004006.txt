Item 1. Business
GENERAL

As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the “Company” or “PGI” refers, unless the context otherwise requires, to PGI Incorporated and its subsidiaries. 

This is a final SEC filing for PGI. Effective December 21, 2022, the Officers and Directors of PGI executed a Resolution to cease operations and allow the dissolution and wind up of the affairs of the Company.

The Company, a Florida corporation, was founded in 1958, and up until the mid 1990’s was in the business of building and selling homes, developing and selling home sites and selling undeveloped or partially developed tracts of land. Over approximately the last 30 years, the Company’s business focus has concentrated on its sales of its remaining real estate. This change was prompted by its continuing financial difficulties due to the principal and interest owed on its debt. 

For many years, the Company’s independent accountants and management stated in its SEC filings that there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. PGI has been filing as an Inactive Registrant since 2019 when the Board of Directors of PGI concluded that PGI met all of the conditions of an “Inactive Entity” as that term is defined in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X and is further contemplated in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance’s Financial Reporting Manual section 1320.2. Accordingly, the financial statements have been unaudited. 

The Company has been administratively dissolved by the Florida Secretary of State for the 2022 calendar year. During 2022, two single family lots were sold and Sugarmill Woods Inc. (“Sugarmill Woods”) realized approximately $39,000. The costs of continued operations, including insurance, administrative expenses, SEC filings, tax return preparation and filing, and other expenses of the Company exceed any income to which the Company is or reasonably could be entitled. The net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $51,000 and $23,000 was used during the year ended December 31, 2021.

With the December 21, 2022 Resolution, the Board approved the sale of the Company’s last remaining parcel of value for a purchase price of $200,000, consistent with the offer in a sale transaction which failed earlier in the year. The parcel was sold to Love Investment Company (“LIC”), the primary preferred shareholder of PGI. Further, the Resolution approved the payment of the proceeds of the sale in full settlement of the remaining aggregate balance of accrued interest of the Convertible Secured Debentures of $52,709,836, held by LIC and Love-1989 Florida Partners L.P.,(“Love-1989”) an affiliate of LIC in proportion to their respective outstanding balances.

Item 1. Business (continued)

The Company’s remaining land inventory consisting of minor parcels of real estate available for tax sale. It consists of easements in Citrus County, Florida, and 12 parcels of real estate in Charlotte County, Florida, which total approximately 58 acres. The parcels have limited value because of associated developmental constraints such as wetlands, easements, and/or other obstacles to development and sale. The real estate taxes for the remaining parcels are delinquent.
