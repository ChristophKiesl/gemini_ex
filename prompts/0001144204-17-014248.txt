Company Overview
 
The following information is qualified in its entirety by and should be read together with the more detailed information and audited financial statements, including the related notes, contained or incorporated by reference in this report.
General
 
We operate in the fragrance business and manufacture, market and distribute a wide array of fragrance and fragrance related products. We manage our business in two segments, European based operations and United States based operations. Prestige fragrance products are produced and marketed by both our United States operations, and our European operations, the latter, through our 73% owned subsidiary in Paris, Interparfums SA, which is also a publicly traded company, as 27% of Interparfums SA shares trade on the NYSE Euronext.
 
Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and deliver them to one of our distribution centers.
 
Our prestige products focus on niche brands, each with a devoted following. By concentrating in markets where the brands are best known, we have had many successful launches. We typically launch new fragrance families for our brands every year or two, and more frequently seasonal and limited edition fragrances are introduced as well.
 
The creation and marketing of each product family is intimately linked with the brand’s name, its past and present positioning, customer base and, more generally, the prevailing market atmosphere. Accordingly, we generally study the market for each proposed family of fragrance products for almost a full year before we introduce any new product into the market. This study is intended to define the general position of the fragrance family and more particularly its scent, bottle, packaging and appeal to the buyer. In our opinion, the unity of these four elements of the marketing mix makes for a successful product.
 
As with any business, many aspects of our operations are subject to influences outside our control. We discuss in greater detail risk factors relating to our business in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and the reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
European Operations
 
We produce and distribute our fragrance products primarily under license agreements with brand owners, and fragrance product sales through our European operations represented approximately 78% of net sales for 2016. We have built a portfolio of prestige brands, which include Balmain, Boucheron, Coach, Jimmy Choo, Karl Lagerfeld, Lanvin, Montblanc, Paul Smith, S.T. Dupont, Repetto, Rochas and Van Cleef & Arpels, whose products are distributed in over 100 countries around the world.

With respect to the Company’s largest brands, we own the Lanvin brand name for its class of trade, and license the Montblanc and Jimmy Choo brand names. As a percentage of net sales, product sales for the Company’s largest brands were as follows:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-----------+-------------------------+---
 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014
Montblanc | | 23 | % | | 21 | % | 22 | %
Jimmy Choo | | 17 | % | | 20 | % | 16 | %
Lanvin | | 12 | % | | 15 | % | 18 | %

United States Operations
 
Prestige brand fragrance products are also marketed through our United States operations, and represented 22% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. These fragrance products are sold under trademarks owned by us or pursuant to license or other agreements with the owners of brands, which include Abercrombie & Fitch, Agent Provocateur, Anna Sui, bebe, Dunhill, Hollister, French Connection, Oscar de la Renta, and Shanghai Tang brands. 
 
Recent Developments
 
Buyout of License
 
In December 2016, we reached an agreement with the Balmain brand calling for Balmain to buyout the Balmain license agreement, effective December 31, 2016, in exchange for a payment aggregating €5.4 million (approximately $5.7 million). As a result of the buyout, we recognized a gain of $4.7 million and we expect to receive the buyout payment by April 30, 2017. We have a three month inventory sell-off period ending March 31, 2017 and Balmain has also agreed to purchase all remaining inventory and tangible assets.
 
Impairment loss
 
We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Product sales of our Karl Lagerfeld brand have not met with our original expectations. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we decided that we will most likely exercise our rights for an early termination of the Karl Lagerfeld license in 2024, rather than continue the license through its original expiration in 2032. As a result of the shortened expected life of the license, we recorded an impairment loss of $5.7 million as of December 31, 2016.
 
ST Dupont
 
In September 2016, we renewed our license agreement with S.T. Dupont for the creation, development and distribution of fragrance products through December 31, 2019, without any material changes in terms and conditions. Our initial 11-year license agreement with S.T. Dupont was signed in June 1997, and had previously been extended through December 31, 2016.

Settlement with French Tax Authorities
 
The French Tax Authorities examined the 2012 tax return of Interparfums SA, and in August 2015 issued a $6.9 million tax adjustment. It is our position that the French Tax Authorities are incorrect in their assessments and we believe that we have strong arguments to support our tax positions. The main issues challenged by the French Tax Authorities related to the commission rate and royalty rate paid to Interparfums Singapore Pte. and Interparfums (Suisse) SARL, respectively. Interparfums Singapore Pte. and Interparfums (Suisse) SARL are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Interparfums SA. Due to the subjective nature of the issues involved, in April 2016, Interparfums SA reached an agreement in principle to settle the entire matter with the French Tax Authorities. The settlement requires Interparfums SA to pay a tax assessment of $1.9 million covering the issues for not only the 2012 tax year, but also covering the issues for the tax years ended 2013 through 2015. The settlement also includes an agreement as to future acceptable commission and royalty rates, which is not expected to have a significant impact on cash flow. The settlement, which is subject to formal documentation with the French Tax Authorities, was accrued for in March 2016. In July 2016, Interparfums SA paid $1.1 million to the French Tax Authorities upon receipt of formal notification regarding tax years 2013 and 2014.

Anna Sui—In June 2011, we entered into a 10-year exclusive worldwide fragrance license agreement to produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Anna Sui brand. Our rights under the agreement commenced on January 1, 2012 when we took over production and distribution of the existing Anna Sui fragrance collections.
 
We are working in partnership with American designer, Anna Sui, and her creative team to build upon the brand’s growing customer appeal, and develop new fragrances that capture the brand’s very sweet feminine girly aspect, combined with touch of nostalgia, hipness and rock-and-roll. Anna Sui’s devoted customer base, which spans the world, is concentrated in Asia.
 
Anna Sui product sales have declined in the past three years primarily owing to the slowdown in the Chinese economy where the brand is especially popular. We are currently distributing several lines of product, including top sellers, La Vie de Bohème, Romantica and Secret Wish.
 
Balmain— In December 2016, we reached an agreement with the Balmain brand calling for Balmain to buyout the Balmain license agreement, effective December 31, 2016, in exchange for a payment aggregating €5.4 million (approximately $5.7 million). As a result of the buyout, we recognized a gain of $4.7 million and we expect to receive the buyout payment by April 30, 2017. We have a three month inventory sell-off period ending March 31, 2017 and Balmain has also agreed to purchase all remaining inventory and tangible assets.

Our first new fragrance under the Boucheron brand, Jaïpur Bracelet, debuted in 2012, and Boucheron Place Vendôme, which has a beautiful glasswork bottle with a cabochon, the emblematic stone of House Boucheron, was released in 2013. In 2015, we launched a new fragrance duo for the Boucheron brand around its iconic Quatre ring, Boucheron Quatre. A six scent collection is launching under the Boucheron brand in 2017.
 
Coach— In April 2015, we entered into an exclusive 11-year worldwide license with Coach, Inc. to create, produce and distribute new men’s and women’s fragrances and fragrance related products under the Coach brand name. We distribute these fragrances globally to department stores, specialty stores and duty free shops, as well as in Coach retail stores.

In 2016, we launched our first Coach fragrance, a women’s scent, which has quickly become a top selling new prestige fragrance. A men’s scent is planned for 2017.
 
Dunhill—In December 2012, we entered into an exclusive 10-year worldwide fragrance license to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Dunhill brand.
 
The house of Dunhill was established in 1893 and since that time has been dedicated to providing high quality men’s luxury products, with core collections offered in menswear, leather goods and accessories. The brand has global reach through a premium mix of self-managed retail outlets, high-level department stores and specialty stores. Known for its commitment to elegance and innovation and being a leader of British men’s style, the brand continues to blend innovation and creativity with traditional craftsmanship.
 
We took over production and distribution of Dunhill legacy fragrances beginning in 2013, and we introduced a legacy scent flanker, Desire Black, in 2014. In 2015, we rolled out our new Dunhill scent, Icon, the success of which has made the Dunhill brand our largest and fastest growing brand within our United States based operations. For 2016, we launched several product extensions including Icon Luxury Spray Set and Icon Elite. The brand’s Desire family is adding a new scent, Desire Extreme in 2017.

French Connection operates retail stores and concessions in the United Kingdom, Europe, United States and Canada and also operates an ecommerce business in each of those territories.
 
Jimmy Choo— In October 2009, we entered into an exclusive 12-year worldwide license agreement for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances under the Jimmy Choo brand.
 
With a heritage in luxury footwear, Jimmy Choo today encompasses a complete luxury lifestyle accessory brand with men’s and women's shoes, handbags, small leather goods, sunglasses and eyewear. Its products are available in the growing network of Jimmy Choo freestanding stores as well as in the most prestigious department, specialty and duty free stores worldwide.
 
Our first fragrance under the Jimmy Choo brand, a signature scent, rolled out globally in 2011. Jimmy Choo product sales exceeded our expectations and sales topped $40 million in that first year. In 2013, we launched our second Jimmy Choo line, Flash, and in 2014, we debuted Jimmy Choo Man our first men’s scent which ranked in 2015 as the 9th best-selling men’s fragrance in the United States. In 2015, the launch of Jimmy Choo Illicit, our third women's fragrance under that label, was the principal driver for brand growth. For 2016, we debuted a new women’s flanker, Jimmy Choo Illicit Flower. In 2017, we have both a women’s and men’s fragrance initiative planned for the brand.
 
Karl Lagerfeld— In October 2012, we entered into a 20-year worldwide license agreement with Karl Lagerfeld B.V., the internationally renowned haute couture fashion house, to create, produce and distribute fragrances under the Karl Lagerfeld brand.
 
Under the creative direction of Karl Lagerfeld, one of the world’s most influential and iconic designers, the Lagerfeld Portfolio represents a modern approach to distribution, an innovative digital strategy and a global 360 degree vision that reflects the designer’s own style and soul. Our first line, a premium namesake duo scent for both men and women, was launched in 2014. However, in 2015, with sales concentrated in Russia and northern Europe, re-orders were disappointing and sales of this brand declined despite the launch of Private Klub, a line extension.

Karl Lagerfeld product sales have failed to meet with our original expectations. In 2016, the Company decided that it will most likely exercise its rights for an early termination of the Karl Lagerfeld license in 2024, rather than continue the license through its original expiration in 2032. As a result of the shortened expected life of the license, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $5.7 million as of December 31, 2016. We will attempt to reinvigorate this brand by changing its strategic positioning and instituting new pricing in 2017.
 
Lanvin— In July 2007, we acquired the worldwide rights to the Lanvin brand names and international trademarks listed in Class 3, our class of trade. A synonym of luxury and elegance, the Lanvin fashion house, founded in 1889 by Jeanne Lanvin, expanded into fragrances in the 1920s.
 
Lanvin is currently our third largest brand by sales volume. Lanvin fragrances occupy an important position in the selective distribution market in France, Europe and Asia. Current lines in distribution include: Arpège, Lanvin L’Homme, Éclat d’Arpège, Rumeur 2 Rose, Jeanne Lanvin, Marry Me!, Jeanne Lanvin Couture, Lanvin Me and Me L’Eau. Our Éclat d’Arpège line accounts for approximately 50% of this brand’s sales. We have extended our Lanvin fragrance families, and in order to capitalize on the success of our Éclat d’Arpège line, in 2015, we launched Éclat d’Arpège Homme as well as Éclat de Fleurs. For 2016, we released a new women’s line, Lanvin Modern Princess in limited distribution to be followed by broader international distribution in 2017. In addition, another interpretation of Éclat d’Arpège is also in the works for 2017. Lanvin brand product sales continue to be affected by the economic slowdown in its two flagship markets, Russia and China.
 
Montblanc—In October 2015, we extended our license agreement with Montblanc by five years. The original agreement, signed in 2010, provided us with the exclusive worldwide license rights to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Montblanc brand through December 31, 2020. The new 10-year agreement, which went into effect on January 1, 2016, extends the partnership through December 31, 2025 without any material changes in operating conditions from the prior license. 
 
Montblanc has achieved a world-renowned position in the luxury segment and has become a purveyor of exclusive products, which reflect today’s exacting demands for timeless design, tradition and master craftsmanship. Through its leadership positions in writing instruments, watches and leather goods, promising growth outlook in women's jewelry, active presence in more than 70 countries, network of more than 350 boutiques worldwide and high standards of product design and quality, Montblanc has quickly grown to be our largest and fastest growing fragrance brand.
 
In 2011, we launched our first new Montblanc fragrance, Legend, which quickly became our best-selling men’s line. In 2012, we launched our first women’s fragrance under the Montblanc brand, and our second men’s line, Emblem, was launched in 2014. Montblanc has quickly become our largest selling brand. The Emblem line was expanded in 2015 to include Montblanc Emblem Intense and a new women's scent, Lady Emblem. In 2016, we further extended our successful Montblanc Legend line with a new men’s scent, Montblanc Legend Spirit.

Oscar de la Renta— In October 2013, we entered into a 12-year exclusive worldwide license to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Oscar de la Renta brand. In 2014, we took over distribution of fragrances within the brand’s legacy fragrance portfolio, and our first new women’s fragrance under the Oscar de la Renta brand, Extraordinary, was launched in 2015. For 2016, in addition to several flankers that we launched throughout the year in select markets, we debuted a new men’s fragrance family, Oscar de la Renta Gentlemen. Bella Blanca, a new Oscar de la Renta scent, will be introduced in 2017.
 
Oscar de la Renta is one of the world’s leading luxury goods firms. The New York-based company was established in 1965, and encompasses a full line of women’s accessories, bridal, childrenswear, fragrance, beauty and home goods, in addition to its internationally renowned signature women’s ready to wear collection. Oscar de la Renta products are sold globally in fine department and specialty stores, www.oscardelarenta.com and through wholesale channels. The Oscar de la Renta brand has a loyal following in the United States, Canada and Latin America.
 
Paul Smith— We signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Paul Smith in December 1998 for the creation, development and distribution of Paul Smith fragrances. In 2008, we extended this license for an additional seven years through December 31, 2017, and although we cannot assure you we will be successful, we are currently in discussions to extend this license through December 31, 2019.
 
Paul Smith is an internationally renowned British designer who creates fashion with a clear identity. Paul Smith has a modern style which combines elegance, inventiveness and a sense of humor and enjoys a loyal following, especially in the UK and Japan. Fragrances include: Paul Smith, Paul Smith Extrême, Paul Smith Rose and Paul Smith Essential.
 
Repetto— In December 2011, we entered into a 13-year exclusive worldwide license agreement to create, produce and distribute fragrances under the Repetto brand.
 
Created in 1947 by Rose Repetto at the request of her son, dancer and choreographer Roland Petit, Repetto is today a legendary name in the world of dance. For a number of years it has developed timeless and must-have collections with a fully modernized signature style ranging from dance shoes, ballet slippers, flat shoes, and sandals to more recently handbags and high-end accessories.
 
With Repetto boutiques in several countries throughout the world, the brand has branched out into Asia, notably China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and Japan with a mix of cross-generational appeal and French chic. Our first Repetto fragrance line was launched in 2013 and a floral scent was added in 2015. Despite this brand’s success with footwear, handbags and high end accessories, fragrance sales have been disappointing due to the lack of brand recognition.
 
Rochas— In May 2015, we acquired the Rochas brand from The Procter & Gamble Company. Founded by Marcel Rochas in 1925, the brand began as a fashion house and expanded into perfumery in the 1950s under Hélène Rochas' direction. This transaction included all brand names and registered trademarks for Rochas (Femme, Madame, Eau de Rochas, etc.), mainly for class 3 (cosmetics) and class 25 (fashion). Substantially the entire €106 million purchase price for the assets acquired (approximately $118 million) was allocated to trademarks with indefinite lives, including approximately $5.4 million in acquisition related expenses.

This acquisition opened up a new page in the Company's history by integrating for the first time both fragrances and fashion. This is allowing us to apply a global approach to managing a fragrance brand with complete freedom in terms of creativity and aesthetic choices, as well as a very high degree of visibility to establish a position of even greater preeminence for Rochas in the luxury goods universe. Rochas brand sales currently include approximately $2 million of royalties generated by the fashion and accessory business via its portfolio of license agreements. Our first new fragrance for Rochas, Mademoiselle Rochas, is to be launched in the first quarter of 2017.
 
Shanghai Tang— In July 2013, we created a wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary, Inter Parfums USA Hong Kong Limited, which entered into a 12-year exclusive worldwide license to create, produce and distribute fragrances under China’s leading luxury brand, Shanghai Tang. Our first Shanghai Tang fragrance collection for men and women debuted in 2015.

For 2016, we launched a new men’s line, In New York, and a new women’s line, So First. Sales of the Collection Extraordinaire line have experienced continued growth since its debut.

Business Strategy 
 
Focus on prestige beauty brands. Prestige beauty brands are expected to contribute significantly to our growth. We focus on developing and launching quality fragrances utilizing internationally renowned brand names. By identifying and concentrating in the most receptive market segments and territories where our brands are known, and executing highly targeted launches that capture the essence of the brand, we have had a history of successful launches. Certain fashion designers and other licensors choose us as a partner, because our Company’s size enables us to work more closely with them in the product development process as well as our successful track record.
 
Grow portfolio brands through new product development and marketing. We grow through the creation of fragrance family extensions within the existing brands in our portfolio. Every year or two, we create a new family of fragrances for each brand in our portfolio. We frequently introduce seasonal and limited edition fragrances as well. With new introductions, we leverage our ability and experience to gauge trends in the market and further leverage the brand name into different product families in order to maximize sales and profit potential. We have had success in introducing new fragrance families (sub-brands, flanker brands or flankers) within our brand franchises. Furthermore, we promote the smooth and consistent performance of our prestige fragrance operations through knowledge of the market, detailed analysis of the image and potential of each brand name, a “good dose” of creativity and a highly professional approach to international distribution channels.
 
Continue to add new brands to our portfolio, through new licenses or acquisitions. Prestige brands are the core of our business and we intend to add new prestige beauty brands to our portfolio. Over the past twenty years, we have built our portfolio of well-known prestige brands through acquisitions and new license agreements. We intend to further build on our success in prestige fragrances and pursue new licenses and acquire new brands to strengthen our position in the prestige beauty market. To that end, during 2014, we signed fragrance licenses for Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister brands; in 2015, we signed fragrance licenses for Coach and French Connection, extended our Montblanc fragrance license and purchased the Rochas brand, and in 2016, we extended the terms of our S.T. Dupont and bebe licenses. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $256 million, which we believe should assist us in entering new brand licenses or outright acquisitions. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any future agreements, or acquire brands or assets on terms favorable to us, or if we do, that any such transaction will be successful. We identify prestige brands that can be developed and marketed into a full and varied product families and, with our technical knowledge and practical experience gained over time, take licensed brand names through all phases of concept, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution.
 
Expand existing portfolio into new categories. We intend to selectively broaden our product offering beyond the fragrance category and offer other fragrance related products and personal care products under some of our existing brands. We believe such product offerings meet customer needs and further strengthen customer loyalty.

Continue to build global distribution footprint. Our business is a global business and we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. In order to adapt to changes in the environment and our business, we have formed and are operating distribution subsidiaries in the major markets of the United States, Italy, Spain and Germany for distribution of prestige fragrances. We may look into future joint arrangements or acquire distribution companies within other key markets to distribute certain of our prestige brands. While building a global distribution footprint is part of our long-term strategy, we may need to make certain decisions based on the short-term needs of the business. We believe that in certain markets, vertical integration of our distribution network may be one of the keys to future growth of our Company, and ownership of such distribution should enable us to better serve our customers’ needs in local markets and adapt more quickly as situations may determine.

Suppliers' accounts for our European operations are primarily settled in euro and for our United States operations, suppliers’ accounts are primarily settled in U.S. dollars. For our European operations, prestige fragrances, components and contract filling needs are purchased from many different suppliers located around the world. For United States operations, components for our prestige fragrances are primarily sourced, produced and filled in the United States, and our mass market products are primarily manufactured, produced or filled in the United States or China. 
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Our products are distributed in over 100 countries around the world through a selective distribution network. For our international distribution, we either contract with independent distribution companies specializing in luxury goods or distribute prestige products through our distribution subsidiaries. In each country, we designate anywhere from one to three distributors on an exclusive basis for one or more of our name brands. We also distribute our products through a variety of duty free operators, such as airports and airlines and select vacation destinations.
 
As our business is a global one, we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. For distribution of brands within our European based operations we operate through our distribution subsidiaries in the major markets of the United States, Italy, Spain and Germany. Our third party distributors vary in size depending on the number of competing brands they represent. This extensive and diverse network together with our own distribution subsidiaries provides us with a significant presence in over 100 countries around the world.
 
Approximately 40% of our European based prestige fragrance net sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
The business of our European operations has become increasingly seasonal due to the timing of shipments by our majority-owned distribution subsidiaries to their customers, which are weighted to the second half of the year.
 
For our United States operations, we distribute product to approved retailers and distributors in the United States as well as internationally, including duty free and other travel-related retailers. We utilize our in house sales team to reach our third party distributors and customers outside the United States. In addition, the business of our United States operations has become increasingly seasonal as shipments are weighted toward the second half of the year.

Competition
 
The market for prestige fragrance products is highly competitive and sensitive to changing preferences and demands. The prestige fragrance industry is highly concentrated around certain major players with resources far greater than ours. We compete with an original strategy, regular and methodical development of quality fragrances for a growing portfolio of internationally renowned brand names.
Inventory
 
We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers based on internal estimates of anticipated need for finished goods, which enables us to meet production requirements for finished goods. We generally deliver product to customers within 72 hours of the receipt of their orders. Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and then deliver them to one of our distribution centers.

Product Liability
 
Our United States operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of $5.0 million, and our European operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of €20.0 million (approximately $21.1 million). Based upon our experience, we believe this coverage is adequate and covers substantially all of the exposure we may have with respect to our products. We have never been the subject of any material product liability claims. 
Government Regulation
 
A fragrance is defined as a “cosmetic” under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. A fragrance must comply with the labeling requirements of this FDC Act as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and its regulations. Some of our color cosmetic products may contain menthol and are also classified as a “drug”. Under U.S. law, a product may be classified as both a cosmetic and a drug. Additional regulatory requirements for products which are “drugs” include additional labeling requirements, registration of the manufacturer and the semi-annual update of a drug list. In addition, various jurisdictions prohibit the use of certain ingredients in fragrances and cosmetics.
 
Our fragrances are subject to the approval of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as a result of the use of specially denatured alcohol. So far we have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required approvals.
 
Our fragrance products that are manufactured or sold in Europe are subject to certain regulatory requirements of the European Union, such as Cosmetic Directive 76/768/CEE and Regulation number 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, but as of the date of this report, we have not experienced any material difficulties in complying with such requirements.
 
Trademarks
 
The market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names. We have licenses or other rights to use, or own, the material trademark and brand name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products both in the United States and in other countries where such products are principally sold. Therefore, trademark and brand name protection is important to our business. Although most of the brand names we license, use or own are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or brand name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and brand names may be substantial.
