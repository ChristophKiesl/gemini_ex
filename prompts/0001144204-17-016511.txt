Item 1. Business
 
Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we” or “us”) receives royalty revenues from existing licensing arrangements with other companies primarily related to sales of four marketed drug products, namely, PegIntron ®, Sylatron ®, Macugen ® and CIMZIA ®. The primary source of our royalty revenues is sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”). We currently have no clinical operations and limited corporate operations. We have no intention of resuming any clinical development activities or acquiring new sources of royalty revenues. Royalty revenues from sales of PegIntron accounted for approximately 64% and 80% of our total royalty revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
We were previously dedicated to the research and development of innovative therapeutics for patients with high unmet medical needs. Beginning in December 2012, our Board of Directors, with outside consultants, began a review of the possible sale or disposition of one or more corporate assets or a sale of the Company. At that time, we suspended substantially all clinical development activities with a goal of conserving capital and maximizing value returned to our stockholders. By April 2013, the review did not result in a definitive offer to acquire us or all or substantially all of our assets. At the same time, we announced that our Board of Directors intended to distribute excess cash, expected to arise from ongoing royalty revenues, in the form of periodic dividends to stockholders.
 
Subsequently, the following significant events occurred:

We received a letter dated April 13, 2015, from counsel for Sigma Tau Pharma Ltd regarding the agreement dated November 9, 2009 (the “Agreement”) between us and Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Defiante Farmaceutica, S.A. and Sigma-Tau Finanzaria, S.P.A. (collectively “Sigma-Tau”). In its letter, Sigma-Tau alleged that it was entitled to offset $826,128 (the “Claim”) in rebate payments earned in the fourth quarter of 2014 and paid in the first quarter of 2015 that would otherwise have been due us as royalty payments under the Agreement. Sigma-Tau claimed that the offset represented the amount by which the net rebate exceeded the reserve for such payments on the balance sheet and was allowed pursuant to the Indemnity provisions of the Agreement. By letter dated April 28, 2015, we replied that the offset was not allowed under the Agreement, and that in any event, it was time-barred. Sigma-Tau did not assert that there was any liability beyond an offset against royalties that were otherwise due.
 
Effective June 25, 2015, Sigma-Tau and we agreed to settle the Claim for $526,128. Sigma-Tau retained an amount equal to $826,128 that would, but for the Claim, be due and owing to us under the Agreement in the second quarter of 2015, but under the terms of the settlement agreed to pay to us $300,000 (the “Settlement Amount”). We agreed that upon receipt of such amount, we would not have a claim for $826,128 in royalties earned for the fourth quarter of 2014, provided that we maintain our right, upon written request to Sigma-Tau and through an independent accounting firm, to inspect the relevant records of Sigma-Tau at any time within the three-year period following the close of each calendar year for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of all payments or charges used to calculate royalties payable under the Agreement for such calendar year and to make a claim as a result of such inspection. We recorded the $300,000 as royalty revenue during the second quarter of 2015 and received such Settlement Amount on July 13, 2015.
 
In June 2015, we delivered notice to Nektar Therapeutics, Inc. (“Nektar”) asserting a breach of our Cross-License and Option Agreement with Nektar for Nektar’s failure to pay a post-patent expiration immunity fee that we believe became payable under such agreement with respect to certain of our patents that would be infringed by Nektar’s products (or those of Nektar’s licensees). To date, Nektar has disputed our claim to an immunity fee.  On August 14, 2015, we filed a summons and complaint against Nektar in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for breach of contract. On October 23, 2015, Nektar filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On February 2, 2016, the Court granted Nektar’s motion to dismiss the complaint. The Company appealed this dismissal and on October 25, 2016 the Appellate Division reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. On November 28, 2016, Nektar served an amended answer and counterclaim alleging that the patents at issue are unenforceable. While we believe that an immunity fee is currently due and payable by Nektar and we intend to continue to pursue this claim, the outcome of such dispute is uncertain and there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect, in full or in part, the immunity fee or any future payments related thereto from Nektar. As such, no amounts have been recorded as of December 31, 2016.
 
On February 4, 2016, we entered into (i) an agreement (the “Surrender and Release Agreement”) with Kingsbridge 2005, LLC (the “Landlord”) and Axcellerate Pharma, LLC (the “Subtenant”) and (ii) a letter agreement with the Landlord (the “Letter Agreement”). Pursuant to the Surrender and Release Agreement, (i) the Company’s lease agreement with the Landlord, dated as of April 1, 1995, as amended (the “Prime Lease”), terminated effective as of February 4, 2016 (the “Termination Date”) and (ii) the Company’s amended and restated sublease agreement with the Subtenant, dated as of November 13, 2013 (the “Sublease”) became a direct lease between the Landlord and the Subtenant effective as of the Termination Date. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, from and after the Termination Date, the Landlord has agreed to perform all of the Company’s obligations under the Sublease, the Landlord has waived all claims against the Company in connection with the Prime Lease, the Sublease or the premises at 20 Kingsbridge Road, Piscataway, New Jersey (the “Premises”) and the Landlord has released us from all liability in connection with the Prime Lease and the Sublease and, in exchange therefor, on the Termination Date, we paid $4.25 million to the Landlord’s mortgage lender and approximately $204,000 to the Landlord (together, the “Release Payments”).
 
Commencing on March 1, 2016, we changed the location of our principal executive offices to 20 Commerce Drive, Suite 135, Cranford, New Jersey, 07016. We entered into an office service agreement with Regus Management Group, LLC (“Regus”) for use of office space at this location effective March 1, 2016. The term of the agreement was to continue until February 28, 2017. Under the agreement, in exchange for our right to use the office space at this location, the Company was required to pay Regus an initial service retainer of $2,418 and thereafter paid Regus a monthly fee of $1,209. This agreement was renewed for another year to February 28, 2018 at a monthly fee of $1,229.

We wound down our remaining research and development activities during 2013 and we have no intention of resuming any clinical development activities or acquiring new sources of royalty revenues.
 
Plan of Dissolution
 
On February 4, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (the “Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution”), pursuant to which the Company would, subject to obtaining requisite stockholder approval, be liquidated and dissolved in accordance with Sections 280 and 281(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. In approving the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, our Board of Directors had considered, among other factors, the ability of the Company to obtain no-action relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to suspend certain of the Company’s reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the anticipated cost savings if such relief is granted by the SEC. Upon further review, the Company concluded that the SEC was unlikely to grant such relief to the Company in 2016. Accordingly, after further consideration, our Board of Directors determined that it would be fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to postpone seeking stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution until a later time to be determined by our Board of Directors.
 
If dissolution and liquidation of the Company pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution are approved by our stockholders and implemented by us, we expect the Company’s corporate existence to continue for the purpose of winding up its business and affairs through the year 2021, consistent with the expiration of our existing license arrangements that generate our royalty revenues. Our future royalty revenues are forecasted to aggregate approximately $10.1 million from the beginning of 2017 through the end of 2021. This forecast is based upon a variety of estimates and numerous assumptions made by the Company’s management with respect to, among other matters, forecasted sales of the drug products for which we have the right to receive royalties and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, are subject to significant uncertainties, and are beyond the Company’s control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions upon which this forecast is based will prove accurate, that the projected results will be realized or that actual results will not be substantially higher or lower than forecasted.
 
ROYALTIES
 
We receive royalty revenues from existing licensing arrangements with other companies primarily related to sales of four marketed drug products, namely, PegIntron ® , Sylatron ® , Macugen ® and CIMZIA ® . PegIntron has been the largest source of our royalty income. Royalty revenues from sales of PegIntron accounted for approximately 64% and 80% of our total royalty revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our right to receive royalties on U. S. sales of PegIntron expired in 2016.

DRUG PRODUCT | PRIMARY OR TARGET INDICATIONS | DRUG MARKETER | ROYALTY EXPIRATION

PegIntron is a PEG-enhanced version of Merck’s alpha interferon product, INTRON ® A, which is used both as a monotherapy and in combination with REBETOL ® (ribavirin) capsules for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Merck holds an exclusive worldwide license to PegIntron. We are entitled to receive royalties on Merck’s worldwide sales of PegIntron until certain expiration dates set forth in the license agreement. Our rights to receive royalties from sales of PegIntron expired in the U.S. in 2016 and are expected to expire in Europe in 2018 and expire in Japan in 2021. Merck is responsible for all manufacturing, marketing, and development activities for PegIntron. We designed PegIntron to allow for less frequent dosing and to yield greater efficacy, as compared to INTRON ® A. On March 29, 2011, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved peginterferon alfa-2b (Sylatron®) to treat melanoma with nodal involvement after surgical resection.
 
Sales of PegIntron have been in decline since 2008. Products that compete with PegIntron have been and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers. In addition, there are multiple oral drug therapies, both available and in development, that have been effective for treatment of hepatitis C that don’t require interferon. As a result, it is likely that sales of PegIntron-related products will continue their declining trend.


We have out-licensed our proprietary PEGylation and single-chain antibody, or SCA, technologies on our own and through agreements with Nektar and Micromet AG (“Micromet”). Micromet was acquired by Amgen in 2012. Under our Cross-License and Option Agreement with Nektar, Nektar had the lead role in granting sublicenses for certain of our PEGylation patents and we receive royalties on sales of any approved product for which a sublicense has been granted. Effective in January 2007, Nektar’s right to grant additional sublicenses is limited to a certain class of PEGylation patents. Existing sublicenses granted by Nektar prior to January 2007 were unaffected by this change in Nektar’s rights. Currently, we are aware of five third-party products for which Nektar has granted sublicenses to our PEGylation technology, including Valeant/Pfizer’s Macugen, UCB’s CIMZIA, Affymax and Takeda’s OMONTYS, Hoffmann-La Roche’s PEGASYS and an undisclosed Pfizer product. Our U.S. rights to receive royalties under our agreement with Nektar relating to CIMZIA, Macugen and OMONTYS expired in 2014. After the expiration of our sublicensed patents, we believe we are entitled to lesser immunity fees on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis for up to twelve years from the date of first sale of these drugs. Nektar has contested our right to receive an immunity fee and we are currently in litigation in connection in connection with this issue.

COMPETITION
 
General
 
Competition in the biotechnology industry is intense and based to a significant degree on scientific and technological factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of patent and other protection of technology and products, the ability to commercialize products and technological developments, the ability to obtain governmental approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing of products, and the ability to enter into licensing and similar arrangements to facilitate the development of products and meet other business objectives.
 
PegIntron
 
PegIntron, marketed by Merck, competes directly with Hoffmann-La Roche’s PEGASYS. Merck and Hoffmann-La Roche have been the major competitors in the global interferon alfa market since the approval of their unmodified alpha interferon products, INTRON A and ROFERON-A, respectively, and the PEGylated interferon-based combination therapy is a highly competitive market. On December 6, 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Gilead’s Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) 400 mg tablets, a once-daily oral nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. Sovaldi was approved in combination with peg-interferon alpha and ribavirin for genotype 1 and 4 patients, and in combination with ribavirin for genotype 2 and 3 patients. On January 17, 2014, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Sovaldi. On October 10, 2014, the FDA approved Gilead’s Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), the first once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection, eliminating the need for interferon and ribavirin. On November 18, 2014, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Harvoni. On December 19, 2014, the FDA approved Abbvie’s all-oral treatment for hepatitis C, and on January 16, 2015, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for this treatment. In addition, there are multiple oral drug therapies, both available and in development, that have been effective for treatment of hepatitis C that don’t require interferon. As a result, it is likely that sales of PegIntron-related products will continue their declining trend. We expect that the adoption of oral treatments for hepatitis C will have a negative impact on PegIntron revenues.


Sylatron
 
PegIntron was approved for melanoma in March 2011 under the brand name Sylatron®. Merck competes with marketed drugs sold by Bayer and by Bristol-Myers Squibb.
 
Macugen
 
Macugen, marketed by Valeant and Pfizer Inc., currently competes against several other therapies for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Additional treatments for AMD are in various stages of preclinical or clinical testing. If approved, these treatments would also compete with Macugen. Our rights to receive royalties on sales of Macugen expired in the U.S. and Great Britain in 2014. We believe we continue to be entitled to receive an immunity fee for sales of Macugen.
CIMZIA
 
CIMZIA, which is marketed by UCB, currently competes against therapies for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. CIMZIA is a biologic medicine that counteracts tumor necrosis factor (or TNF), which promotes inflammation of the joints in rheumatoid arthritis. Other TNF inhibitors approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab. Infliximab and adalimumab are also used in the treatment of Crohn’s disease. Both diseases also have additional approved treatments that are not TNF inhibitors, as well as other treatments in various stages of preclinical or clinical testing. If approved, these treatments would also compete with CIMZIA. Our rights to receive royalties on sales of CIMZIA expired in the U.S. and Great Britain in 2014. We believe we continue to be entitled to receive an immunity fee for sales of Cimzia.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 
Patents are very important to us in establishing the proprietary rights to the products we have developed or licensed. The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. If our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or if we fail to prevail in potential future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected. We have an extensive portfolio of issued U.S. patents, many of which have foreign counterparts. Of the patents owned or exclusively licensed by us, one relates to PegIntron. The patent related to PegIntron (peginterferon alfa-2b) expired in the U.S. in 2016 and will expire outside of the U.S. in 2018 (including any patent term extensions), except for Japan, where the patent was extended until 2021. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition, we cannot assure you that such patents will be of substantial protection or commercial benefit to us, will afford us adequate protection from competing products, or will not be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, we cannot assure you that additional U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us.
 
Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 
In April 2013, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, we sold to Belrose Pharma, Inc. (“Belrose”), all right, title and interest, including our patents, relating to PEG technology and our PEG-SN38 clinical candidate. As part of our agreement with Santaris, we assigned our rights to our LNA clinical candidates and other LNA compounds to Santaris.
 
In the field of SCA proteins, we have several U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Although we are no longer engaged in clinical activities, our patent assignees are subject to various government regulatory processes. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the clinical development, manufacture, and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state, local and foreign entities regulate research and development activities and the inspection, testing, manufacture, quality assurance, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record-keeping, approval, and promotion of products. Drug products require regulatory approval before commercialization. In particular, therapeutic products for human use are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act, implemented by the FDA, as well as similar statutory and regulatory requirements of foreign countries. Obtaining these marketing approvals and subsequently complying with ongoing statutory and regulatory requirements is costly and time consuming. Any failure by our collaborators, licensors or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approval or in complying with post-approval requirements, could adversely affect our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.

The steps required before a new drug or biological product may be distributed commercially in the U.S. generally include:
 

· | conducting appropriate preclinical laboratory evaluations of the product’s chemistry, formulation and stability, and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submitting the results of these evaluations and tests to the FDA, along with manufacturing information, analytical data and clinical investigational plan, in an IND, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtaining IND acceptance from the FDA, which may require the resolution of any safety or regulatory concerns of the FDA, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards or IRBs, prior to introducing the drug or biological product into humans in clinical trials and registering clinical trials in public databases such as clinicaltrials.gov, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials that establish the safety and efficacy of the drug or safety, purity and potency of the biological product candidate for the intended use, in the following three typically sequential, stages: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Phase I. The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, increased dose tolerance, and possibly absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion,
 
Phase II. The product candidate is studied in patients with the targeted condition to gain safety experience at the proposed dosing schedules, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks to determine the optimal dosage, and to obtain initial information on effectiveness of the product candidate,
 
Phase III. The product candidate is studied in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites to determine primary efficacy and safety endpoints identified at the start of the clinical trial,
 

· | submitting the results of preliminary research, preclinical studies, and clinical studies as well as chemistry, manufacturing and control information on the drug or biological product to the FDA in a New Drug Application or NDA, for a drug product, or a BLA for a biological product, and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtaining FDA approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug or biological product. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
An NDA or BLA must contain, among other things, data derived from non-clinical laboratory studies and clinical trials which demonstrate that the product is safe and effective and for a biological product that it meets prescribed standards of safety, purity and potency, and a full description of manufacturing methods. Biological or drug products may not be marketed in the U.S. until approval by the FDA of an NDA or BLA is received.
 
The approval process can take a number of years, if approval is obtained at all, and often requires substantial financial resources, including license application fees. The results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of the results from large-scale clinical trials, and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs, delays or modifications due to a number of factors, including the difficulty in obtaining enough patients, clinical investigators, drug supply, or financial support. Certain clinical trials performed under an IND must be registered in the official clinical trial website, and non-compliance can result in significant fines. The FDA has the power to impose changes relating to safety and efficacy of approved products. The FDA can impose substantial fines if these requirements are not carried out to the agency’s full satisfaction. Upon approval, a drug product or biological product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the NDA or BLA.

In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each indication for which the manufacturer may market the drug, each domestic drug product manufacturing establishment must register with the FDA, list its drug products with the FDA, comply with and maintain current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and permit and pass inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Moreover, the submission of applications for approval may require the preparation of large-scale production batches that cannot be used commercially and additional time to complete manufacturing stability studies.
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by our licensees pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and a requirement to report adverse experiences with the product. In addition to continued compliance with standard regulatory requirements, the FDA also may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the marketed drug product. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product are discovered following approval.
 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act mandates that drug products be manufactured consistent with cGMP. In complying with the FDA’s regulations on cGMP, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort in production, record-keeping, quality control, quality assurance, and auditing to ensure that the marketed drug product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. The FDA periodically inspects drug product manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with cGMP. Failure to comply with cGMP or other FDA requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible FDA action, such as:
 

· | untitled and warning letters, 
--+-----------------------------------
· | suspension of manufacturing, 
· | seizure of a product, 
· | voluntary recall of a product, 
· | injunctive actions and 
· | civil or criminal penalties. 

 
Even after FDA approval has been obtained, and often as a condition to expedited approval, further studies, including post-marketing studies, are typically required by the FDA. Results of post-marketing studies may limit or expand the further marketing of the products. If the developer of a product proposes any modifications to the product, including changes in indication, manufacturing or testing processes, manufacturing facility or labeling, an NDA or BLA supplement may be required to be submitted to and approved by the FDA.
 
Products manufactured in the U.S. for distribution abroad will be subject to FDA regulations regarding export, as well as to the requirements of the country to which they are shipped. These latter requirements apply to products studied in clinical trials, the submission of marketing applications, and all aspects of product manufacture and marketing. Such requirements vary significantly from country to country. As part of our strategic relationships, our collaborators may be responsible for the foreign regulatory approval process of our products, although we may be legally liable for noncompliance.

We cannot predict the extent of government regulation that might result from current or future legislation or administrative action. Moreover, we anticipate that the presidential administration, Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess controls on health care spending. Any such proposed or actual changes could cause our collaborators to limit or eliminate spending on development projects and may otherwise impact us. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might result from current or future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. Additionally, in both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our proposed products will depend, in part, upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Significant uncertainty often exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. In addition, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
 
PegIntron has been approved for treatment of hepatitis C in the European Union, the U.S., Japan and China, and for the treatment of hepatitis B in China. None of the product candidates we were developing prior to the substantial suspension of our clinical development activities were approved for marketing in the U.S. or elsewhere.
 
With respect to patented products, delays imposed by the government approval process may materially reduce the period during which we will have the exclusive right to exploit them.
