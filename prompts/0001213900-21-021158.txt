General 
 
Applied Energetics, Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our executive office is located at 2480 W Ruthrauff Road, Suite 140 Q, Tucson, Arizona, 85705 and our telephone number is (520) 628-7415.
 
Applied Energetics specializes in the development and manufacture of advanced high-performance lasers, high voltage electronics, advanced optical systems, and integrated guided energy systems for defense, aerospace, industrial, and scientific markets worldwide.
 
Technology and Patents
 
AERG has developed, successfully demonstrated and holds all crucial intellectual property rights to a dynamic Directed Energy technology called Laser Guided Energy (“LGETM”) and Laser Induced Plasma Channel (“LIPCTM”). LGE and LIPC are technologies that can be used in a new generation of high-tech weapons. The Department of Defense (DOD) previously recognized only two key types of Directed Energy Weapon (“DEW”) technologies, High Energy Lasers (“HEL”), and High-Power Microwave (“HPM”). Neither the HEL nor the HPM intellectual property portfolio is owned by a single entity. The DOD then designated a third DEW technology, LGE. Applied Energetics’ LGE and LIPC technologies are wholly owned by Applied Energetics and patent protected with 26 current patents and an additional 11 Government Sensitive Patent Applications (“GSPA”). These GSPA’s are held under secrecy orders of the US government and allow the company greatly extended protection rights.
 
Applied Energetics technology is vastly different from conventional directed energy weapons, i.e. HEL, and HPM. LGE uses Ultra-Short Pulse (USP) laser technology to combine the speed and precision of lasers with the overwhelming impact on targeted threats with high-voltage electricity. This unique directed energy solution allows extremely high peak power and energy, with target and effects tenability and is effective against a wide variety of potential targets. A key element of LGE is its novel ability to offer selectable and tunable properties that can help protect non-combatants and combat zone infrastructure.

Recent Developments
 
As of March 4, 2020, AERG executed a contract having a value of $165,919.77 with the US Army under its STTR program for a 90-day Phase 1 research program to investigate Standoff Electronic Denial systems using ultrashort pulse lasers. On October 20, 2020, it was announced that the company had received notice from the Army that it was not selected for Phase II. While we were disappointed, we continue to believe our advanced technologies can solve critical challenges faced by the U.S. military. Applied Energetics has multiple proposals outstanding for a variety of applications and our team continues to vigorously pursue new opportunities in an effort to leverage our significant intellectual property and core competencies in ultra-short pulse optical sources. The AERG team has recently submitted several provisional patent applications to expand and protect our USP portion of the patent portfolio. We anticipate that this intellectual property development will continue with other future submissions currently under development.  
 
We submitted multiple proposals to various government agencies in 2020. Due to the closures of multiple agencies and work-from-home orders across various regions of the United States, we anticipate that reviews and funding decisions on these proposals might be delayed longer than anticipated as resources are focused on other matters within the government. AERG has received multiple notices from government agencies stating that “the vast number of proposals received, and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the Government’s evaluation timelines.” In addition to these review-based delays, the US federal budget for 2021 was not approved by Congress by the October 1, 2020 start of the U.S. federal government fiscal year. The 2021 federal budget was signed into law on December 27, 2020 and the National Defense Authorization Act for 2021 was enacted after a congressional override of the President’s veto on January 1, 2021, a full three months after the official start of the 2021 fiscal year. This delay could also significantly impact review of proposals and awards of near-term contracts in 2021. The 2021 National Defense Authorization Act has language actually calling for funding and reports on strategies for “Development and fielding of high energy laser capabilities”, which could be addressed with AERG USP optical sources. 
 
Effective March 15, 2021, AERG entered into a Lease Agreement with Campus Research Corporation, for approximately 13,000 rentable square feet of office, laboratory and production space located at the UA Tech Park, a research and technology park owned and operated by the University of Arizona. The company intends to consolidate its offices and expand its R&D capacity by leasing this space which is outfitted with a Class 1000 (ISO Class 6) “clean room” and other turnkey laboratory and conference features.
 
The lease term begins May 1, 2021 and ends on April 30, 2026. The base rent is $6.7626 per rentable square foot for year one, and escalates to $9.2009 in year two, $11.4806 in year three, $13.1740 in year four and $14.9306 in year five, plus certain operating expenses and taxes.
 
The space is currently occupied by a global provider of lasers and laser-based technology which is vacating prior to the end of its lease term. Thus we are benefiting from millions of dollars of capital investment made by the vacating tenant, and the vacating tenant will continue to pay a portion of the full market rent, with the company paying the balance in the amounts set forth above.
 
We believe that this new strategic location will support the company’s anticipated future growth and provide greater capacity for research, product development and production activities. The move, expected to take place starting May 1, 2021, will provide the Company with an ITAR and laser safety compliant facility totaling approximately 13,000 square feet, of which approximately 4,800 square feet is dedicated to the cleanroom
 
On April 28, 2020, AERG was awarded a loan for $132,760 through the Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The terms of this loan were twenty-four months with a 1% annual interest rate. These funds were issued to cover payroll costs over eight weeks covering May and June 2020. Through the utilization of this PPP loan, AERG was able to keep all employees fully engaged during these two months of the pandemic. We intend to follow the guidelines set forth by the SBA on the PPP program which will allow AERG to apply for a waiver of the loan, because of this full employment retention, and have the loan convert to a grant.

Path Forward
 
We believe that USP optical sources, LGE and LIPC are the cornerstone to AERG’s future and remain the key areas of our R&D focus for the near term. We plan to continue building our management team with highly qualified individuals. We intend to recruit additional personnel in the areas of R&D, marketing and finance, and, possibly add members to our Board of Directors and our Board of Advisors. We have worked to align key innovations with our roadmap to encourage and enable internal filing for a broad, strategic and robust intellectual property portfolio of and continue surveying the literature for acquisitions of parallel intellectual property to that end. We also intend to pursue strategic corporate acquisitions in related fields and technology. Although the company has achieved its near-term capital raising goals, we continue to explore any favorable equity financing opportunities.
 
Our goal with the AERG Strategic Plan is to increase the energy, peak power and frequency agility of USP optical sources while decreasing the size, weight, and cost of these systems. We are in the process of developing this breadth of very high peak power USP lasers and additional optical sources that have a very broad range of applicability for threat disruption for the Department of Defense, commercial, and medical applications. Although the historical market for AERG’s LGE and USP technology is the U.S. Government, the USP technologies are expected to provide numerous platforms for commercial additive and subtractive manufacturing and medical device and imaging markets, creating a substantially larger market for our products to address. During 2020, the AERG team was able to develop partnership and teaming arrangements with the three leading laser and optics institutes in the United States, namely, the University of Arizona, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics. Our desire is to work on programs jointly where the strengths of each organization can assist in escalating knowledge and delivery of systems to the government sponsors, and to train the next generation of scientists and engineers to work in the Directed Energy fields.
 
The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic does present unique risks and uncertainties that may alter or otherwise affect our path forward. Our management continues to monitor the possible effects of the COVID-19 on the execution of our plan of operations, our prospective contracts, and the availability of financing to fund our strategic and operational plans going forward. Despite these challenges, we have continued to execute our business development plans and to deliver on our government contracts as per the timeline commitments. During this fiscal year, we submitted multiple proposals and have been engaged in meetings on a daily and weekly basis with various agencies and departments both remotely and in person in Washington, DC and at various other government facilities. Dr. Quarles, our President and CEO, has traveled to DC on multiple occasions during the pandemic in 2020 and remains very committed to pursuing this business even in these challenging times. The interest in our technology and applications remains high, and we continue to submit proposals for all appropriate opportunities and share our vision of the disruptive capabilities of USP optical sources for both near- and far-term threats and dual-use commercial applications.
 
Through our analysis of the market, and in discussions with potential customers, we would also conclude that customers are becoming more receptive and interested in directed energy technologies. According to the Department of Defense fiscal 2019 budget, its directed energy spending grew from approximately $500 million in 2017 to over $1 billion in 2019, an increase of 100%. The 2020 budget reflected directed energy spending of $1.2 billion, an additional increase of 20% over 2019, and from 2017 through 2020, the directed energy budget grew from approximately $500 million to approximately $1.2 billion, averaging approximately 40% per year. As a result, we continue to be even more optimistic about our future and the growing opportunities in directed energy applications. The AERG team anticipates a continuation of strong funding for the Directed Energy community. With our existing patent portfolio, and through further advancements of our technologies, we believe we have the substantial building blocks needed to become a significant and successful developer in our USP and LGE marketplaces.
 
Market for Our Technology
 
Directed Energy Weapons
 
Directed energy weapon system means military action involving the use of directed energy to incapacitate, damage, or destroy enemy equipment, facilities, and assets. Previous to LGE, the only two viable directed energy weapon systems were High Energy Laser (HEL), which uses heat to burn targets and High Power Radio Frequency (HP-RF), weapons that use electromagnetic energy at specific frequencies to disable electronic systems.

HEL and HP-RF directed energy technologies have been under development for decades with numerous DoD and other government contractors participating. The unique attributes of directed energy weapon systems —the ability to create precise effects against multiple targets near-instantaneously and at a very low cost per shot—have great potential to help the DoD in addressing future warfare requirements. The DoD invests research and development dollars into directed energy solutions to fill gaps identified by warfighters. For example, in future conflicts with capable enemies possessing large inventories of guided missiles, it may be operationally risky and cost-prohibitive for the U.S. military to continue to rely exclusively on a limited number of kinetic missile interceptors. Such a “missile competition” could allow an adversary to impose costs on U.S. forces by compelling them to intercept each incoming missile with far more expensive kinetic munitions. The DoD has made significant leaps in both performance and maturity as a result of many years of research with multiple threat-intercept technologies and is being directed by Congress to increase funding and evaluation of pulsed laser technology in future Directed Energy platforms in FY2021.
 
Laser Guided Energy
 
AERG’s patented LGE weapon technology works via wireless electrical energy transmission through the atmosphere, to disable vehicles and other threats to our security. AERG has developed the underlying technologies that allow a user to precisely control where the directed energy goes in direction, range, and magnitude. AERG’s LGE technologies are combined to create “laser filaments” as the laser passes through the atmosphere. The filaments in turn create Laser Induced Plasma Channels (“LIPC”) which enable the transmission of electrical energy.
 
Our development of LGE has led to a third directed energy technology creating a generational opportunity for a completely new weapon system development. The Company uniquely owns the critical intellectual property for LGE. The unique properties and demonstrated target effects of LGE allow for mission areas and applications that are not accessible to either HEL or RF directed energy. Therefore, LGE fills numerous requirements in the urban and asymmetric warfare environment. There is a very broad range of targets and effects that LGE addresses that are uniquely different from HEL and RF directed energy and therefore we do not compete directly within those application spaces. 
  
Competition
 
AERG’s proprietary LIPC based LGE technology is a unique directed energy weapon, with products that can be integrated onto platforms being developed for use by the U.S. Government. Over the past several years, a handful of major defense contractors have received significant funding for DE systems development, manufacturing and integration. These contractors specialize in different directed energy weapon system platforms to respond to a variety of threats. Although AERG competes against other weapon systems for funding, the uniqueness of the LGE technology should continue to support its development into weapon platform programs. AERG, like many other small defense contractors, was adversely affected by cutbacks in U.S. Government spending after 2011. AERG believes that there is renewed U.S. Government interest in directed energy applications and believes that continued development of its USP capabilities, including LGE and LIPC technologies, and growing interest from all branches of the U.S. armed forces and other government agencies will lead to increases in government spending on directed energy weaponry in the coming years. Likewise, there are multiple new threats that must be addressed with unique and emerging technologies, and AERG is working diligently to rapidly advance development, demonstration, testing and engineering of the Advanced Ultrashort Pulse Lasers throughout the spectrum from the ultraviolet to the far infrared. As a percentage of the federal budget, this has the possibility to rapidly accelerate and compare in magnitude with the LGE/LIPC product lines over the next several years.
 
Furthermore, AERG’s primary direct LGE and USP optical sources competition are corporations and contractors supported by foreign governments who may be attempting to develop similar technologies. AERG believes that such foreign activity will create additional U.S. Government funding for both USP sources and LGE in order to maintain our country’s lead in directed-energy weapons.
 
Some of AERG’s biggest commercial competitors are Trumpf (German), Coherent (US), Thales (France) and IPG (US), all billion-dollar market class companies that have substantially more resources than AERG.
 
Employees
