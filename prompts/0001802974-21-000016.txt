Item 1.     Business
Overview
Mission Produce, Inc. (“Mission Produce” or the “Company,” “Registrant,” or “Issuer,” and generally referred to as “we” or “us”) is a world leader in sourcing, producing and distributing fresh avocados, serving retail, wholesale and foodservice customers. In October 2020 we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of common stock, in which we sold 7,450,000 shares at a public offering price of $12.00 per share. Net proceeds were $78.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $6.3 million and issuance costs of $5.0 million, paid by the Company. 
We have two operating segments which are also reporting segments:
•Marketing and Distribution sources fruit primarily from growers and then distributes fruit through our global distribution network; 
•International Farming owns and operates avocado orchards principally located in Peru, that supply our Marketing and Distribution segment with avocados. Substantially all of the avocados produced by our International Farming segment are sold to our Marketing and Distribution segment. 
Products and services 
We source, produce, pack and distribute avocados. The avocados we sell are primarily of the Hass variety. We sort and pack avocados and match their specifications to respective customer requirements. We sell both pre-ripe and ripened avocados, and with our network of ripening facilities, we can adjust the level of ripeness to the needs of our customers. Our custom ripening programs provide customers with the option of ordering avocados at five different stages of ripeness – hard, preconditioned, breaking, firm-ripe and ripe – which are delivered on specifically tailored schedules according to stage of ripeness.
We also provide value-added services including ripening, bagging, custom packing and logistical management. In addition, we provide our customers with merchandising and promotional support, insights on market trends and hands-on training to assist with their retail sales of our avocados. For example, we operate category management, merchandising and packaging programs, such as our “Avocado Intel,” “Minis,” “Emeralds in the Rough,” “Ready,” “Size Minded,” and shelf-life extension programs, to promote the sale of avocados that might otherwise be underutilized, to identify ready-to-eat and various size avocados for consumers and to increase shelf life. 
Customers
We primarily serve retail, wholesale and foodservice customers. We focus on delivering quality avocados on time and within customer specifications. Owning and farming our own avocado orchards also helps to mitigate potential disruptions across our third-party grower supply relationships. We forecast avocado sourcing costs for the season for our own production, which enables us to enter into fixed price contracts with customers for a season without bearing pricing risk from spot market purchases. We do not have long-term contracts with our customers and focus instead on building strong, long-term relationships based on product quality and specifications, on-time delivery and customer support and service.

Supply chain and distribution network 
We have developed a sophisticated global distribution network to transport avocados efficiently from our supply sources, to our packing facilities and distribution centers, and to our end-customers around the world. Proximity to growers enables us to develop stronger relationships, control the logistics of the supply chain from tree to packing, and export fruit from the country of origin faster. Most avocados we source are delivered to one of our four packing houses (two in Mexico, one in Peru, and one in California). At the packing houses, including our co-packers in Mexico, our avocados are sorted and packed for transportation to forward distribution centers globally. We manage transportation logistics across truck, ocean, air and rail platforms to bring product from their source to end markets. Our network of distribution facilities puts us in close proximity to our customers, allowing us to better provide the fruit on time and to specification, and to adapt to changing customer volume and ripeness needs. Within the United States, our distribution network enables the delivery of avocados within approximately eight hours or less. In Europe, we have a distribution center in the Netherlands through which we service our European customer base. Through our investment in Mr. Avocado, we have gained distribution access to retail customers in China.
Competition
We compete based on a variety of factors, including the appearance, taste, size, shelf life and overall quality of our products, price and distribution terms, the timeliness of our deliveries to customers and the availability of our products. The avocado and fresh produce business is highly competitive, and the effect of competition is intensified because our products are perishable. Competition in the sale of avocados that we sell comes from competing producers and distributors. We also compete with smaller packers and marketers.
Resources 
We source avocados primarily from Mexico, California, and Peru, as well as Colombia, Guatemala and Chile. Our diverse sourcing network mitigates the impact of potential geographical or grower-specific supply disruptions and optimizes our ability to fulfill year-round global demand. We do not have exclusive sourcing contracts with growers.
Third-party growers
We have relationships with thousands of third-party growers. Our large scale and long track record of working with growers contributes to strong existing relationships and facilitates new relationships with third-party growers. 
Farming
In addition to purchasing avocados from third-party growers, we grow avocados on owned or leased land to further diversify our sourcing network and provide additional control over our supply. In Peru, we own farmland with developed orchards that are in various stages of maturity as well as undeveloped land that we intend to plant in future years. In fiscal year 2020, we have secured farmland under long term leases in Guatemala that we have begun to develop. We also invest in a joint venture in Colombia that owns land that is under development. After planting, our avocado trees begin to produce avocados in approximately three years and reach full production in approximately five to seven years, depending on location.
We are also involved in the farming of other products on a limited scale. We have planted mango orchards in Peru to enable us to realize synergies from labor and facility management during the avocado off-season. We have also invested in a blueberry farming joint venture that enables us to utilize owned land on which it was not economically feasible to farm avocados. While we do not market blueberries, our investment in Moruga further allows us to leverage labor and facility investments in Peru. 
Research and development
We have a dedicated research and development department focused on finding new ways to innovate across our value chain. For example, we were the first company to utilize ripening centers for avocados in the national distribution process, a practice that has since been adopted by other companies in the industry. More recently, we introduced the use of hydrocoolers early in the supply chain to quickly remove heat from avocados. This practice extends the shelf life of our avocados, enabling us to transport avocados longer distances. In fiscal year 2020, we launched a post-harvest innovation, featuring a quarter-sized biodegradable and food-safe packaging insert that blocks ethylene receptors to extend the shelf-life of fruit, helping our retail and foodservice customers reduce shrink and waste. 
Total research and development expense was $0.4 million, $0.5 million, and $0.3 million for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

Intellectual property 
Our intellectual property includes the federally registered trademark Mission Produce and related brand names. We do not have any patents or other material intellectual property.
Seasonality 
The total sales and sales price of avocados fluctuates throughout the year due to variations in the demand and supply of avocados based on geographic location as well as events, like the Big Game, Cinco de Mayo and Fourth of July. For example, in California and Peru, the production of avocados peaks between May and August, whereas in Mexico production peaks between December and March. Although these geographical differences may lead to fluctuations in the purchase price of avocados, our diverse geographical avocado growth and production capabilities help us mitigate volatility in our access to supply of avocados. As a result of the volumes sourced from our farming operations in Peru, we have in recent years realized a greater portion of our net sales and gross profit during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.
Employees 
As of October 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,500 employees located worldwide, 1,500 of which were located in Peru, 700 of which were located in Mexico, and 300 of which were located in the United States. Due to the cyclical nature of avocado production, we also hire temporary and seasonal workers on our farms in Peru and packing houses in the U.S. to meet our needs. 
We focus on conducting our business with honesty, respect and loyalty. Whether it be through water conservation, increasing use of renewable energy sources, providing meals, transportation and on-site healthcare to our employees in Peru or sponsoring higher-level education for our employees in the U.S., we are committed to operating in a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner. Our corporate culture embodies these values and, as a result, we believe we have a highly motivated and skilled work force that is committed to our business. 
Regulation and Industry Associations 
Our business is impacted by environmental, health and safety, government procurement, anti-bribery and other government regulations and requirements. Below is a summary of some of the significant regulations that impact our business.
As an agricultural producer and marketer of consumable products, our operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal government agencies, including the FDA, the USDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), as well as state and local agencies, with respect to product attributes, packing, labeling, storage and distribution. Under various statutes and regulations, these agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for safety, purity and labeling. In addition, advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the FTC, and our operations are subject to health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”). Our packing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities, including the California State Department of Food and Agriculture (“CFDA”), which oversees weights & measures compliance at our California packing facilities. All of our US facilities are also in compliance with the FDA’s Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”). In addition, our operations in Mexico are subject to Mexican regulations and our operations in Peru are subject to Peruvian regulations.
The agricultural products sold and marketed by us are subject to additional specific government acts or regulations, including the Hass Avocado Promotion, Research and Information Act of 2000 for our avocados.
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other matters, the treatment, handling, storage, use and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and waste, including herbicides, fertilizers, pesticides and other agricultural products, the remediation of contaminated properties and climate change.
In the U.S., the Hass Avocado Board was established by the USDA to promote the sale of Hass variety avocados. This board provides a basis for unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the U.S. marketplace. The California Avocado Commission, which receives its funding from California avocado growers, has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales. We believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the U.S. will, in the long term, positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our avocado businesses. Similarly, Avocados from Mexico (“AFM”) was formed in 2013 as the marketing arm of the Mexican Hass Avocados Importers Association (“MHAIA”) and the Association of Growers and Packers of Avocados From Mexico (“APEAM”).
We seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses, and we are not aware of any instances of material non-compliance.
