General
We are a global genomic diagnostics company that improves patient care by answering important clinical questions to inform diagnosis and treatment decisions throughout the patient journey in cancer and other diseases. Our growing menu of tests leverages advances in genomic science and machine learning technology to change care for patients, enabling them to avoid risky, costly procedures and reduce time to appropriate treatment. In addition to making our genomic tests available in the United States through our central laboratory, our exclusive license to the nCounter® Analysis System, which we believe to be a best-in-class diagnostics platform, positions us to deliver our tests to patients worldwide through laboratories and hospitals that can perform the tests locally. We estimate that our current and near-term pipeline products address an estimated $10 billion global market and that our longer-term pipeline products will enable us to address an estimated $50 billion global market. 
We design our tests to answer critical questions in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases and improve patient outcomes. We deliver clinical and economic utility to patients, physicians and payers, thereby helping to eliminate unnecessary costs burdening the healthcare system. We position our tests to integrate seamlessly into the way physicians currently evaluate patients in order to facilitate adoption. 
We develop our genomic tests using advanced scientific methods, such as RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing and machine learning, and then optimize the assays and classifiers for the platform on which the test will be performed. Historically, we have utilized RNA sequencing methods performed in our CLIA laboratory in South San Francisco, California. Beginning in 2021, we expect to adapt select tests to be performed on the nCounter Analysis System for their international distribution.
We believe our powerful scientific platform provides multiple vectors to create value for patients, providers and payers, as well as stockholders, and to help advance precision medicine:
•Unique Biorepositories - When we develop new tests, we build extensive, robust biorepositories of patient-consented samples and well-curated clinical, radiological, outcome and other information from Institutional Review Board-approved clinical trials to inform our discovery and validation efforts. Our biorepositories are designed to encompass the broad spectrum of disease that our tests may encounter when used in clinical practice, as well as the wide range of conditions associated with patients who are suspected of having a particular disease. We extract extensive genomic information from these patient samples using our RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing platform. 
•Proprietary Technology and Bioinformatics - For biomarker discovery and product development, we utilize machine learning to select the genomic, clinical or other features from our biorepository that best distinguish the condition we are trying to identify. This enables us to develop high-performing genomic classifiers that can answer specific clinical questions. In addition, our bioinformatics pipelines are built to extract genomic variant content from the same assay to inform therapeutic selection.
•High-Performing Commercial Genomic Tests - With the exception of Prosigna, which competes with a first-to-market test in a highly competitive environment, our genomic tests generally serve large, untapped markets where they are changing the diagnostic and treatment paradigm for patients. The majority of our genomic testing business stems from our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, certified laboratory serving the United States market. We believe the nCounter Analysis System affords us the opportunity to adapt our test menu for multiple markets globally, providing flexibility for a global distributed testing model and increased efficiency in our United States-based CLIA lab. Our RNA sequencing platform enables us to offer testing from our CLIA lab for a broad range of gene alterations, which can inform treatment decisions at the time of diagnosis.
We currently offer commercialized genomic tests in four clinical indications that we believe are changing disease diagnosis and patient care. All of our commercial tests are available in the United States and one is available internationally. These include the Afirma® Genomic Sequencing Classifier, or GSC, and the Afirma Xpression Atlas, or XA, designed to improve diagnosis of and inform treatment decisions, respectively, for thyroid cancer; the Percepta® GSC for lung cancer; the Envisia® Genomic Classifier for interstitial lung disease, or ILD, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF; and the Prosigna Breast Cancer Assay for assessing risk of breast cancer distant recurrence. The Prosigna test is available for use on the nCounter Analysis System internationally and in the United States. Our investigational LymphMark lymphoma subtyping is also intended for use on the nCounter Analysis System and is expected to launch in 2021. 
We expect to continue expanding our offerings in thyroid cancer, lung cancer, ILD/IPF, breast cancer and lymphoma, as well as other indications that we believe will benefit from our technology and approach. Our product development pipelines 
address what we believe to be an over $50 billion annual market opportunity in early detection, diagnosis, staging/prognosis, therapy selection/surgery and disease monitoring across the aforementioned indications. We plan to commercially introduce four products in 2021: Our nasal swab test for early lung cancer detection and our Percepta Genomic Atlas, which, together with the Percepta GSC, form a comprehensive lung cancer portfolio that we believe may improve lung cancer diagnosis and treatment decisions; our Envisia classifier on the nCounter Analysis System for expansion into global markets; and our LymphMark lymphoma subtyping test. 
We believe our ability to leverage RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing data in large biorepositories of patient-consented samples in oncology and other indications, our strong commercial position in major clinical indications and our global reach, present partnership opportunities for biopharmaceutical companies to enhance their research and development capabilities and for other genomic diagnostics companies to introduce their non-competitive tests to global markets on the nCounter Analysis System. 
We have formed several biopharmaceutical partnerships, each focused on our current indications to derive value out of our current business or advance future business. Our collaboration with the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson, which began in December 2018, has helped advance our pipeline, including the launch in 2019 of our Percepta GSC on our RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing platform and development of the first non-invasive nasal swab test designed for early lung cancer detection. We have recently expanded our program with Johnson & Johnson to potentially develop future tests designed to detect lung disease before cancer develops. We also collaborate with Acerta Pharma, the hematology research and development arm of AstraZeneca, to provide genomic information that will support its development of oncology therapeutics in lymphoma, for which we are developing our LymphMark test. We have also announced programs in thyroid cancer – with Loxo Oncology (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company) as well as with Bayer AG, or Bayer – that center on our Afirma XA to advance precision medicine based on the test’s comprehensive genomic profiling capabilities. 
During 2020, we also entered into our first two diagnostic company partnerships with CareDx in transplantation and MAVIDx in COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. These collaborations may lead to revenue sources in the future.
The published evidence supporting our tests demonstrates the robustness of our science and clinical studies, which we believe is key to driving adoption and reimbursement. Patients and physicians can access a more comprehensive list of publications on our website. Over 50 clinical studies covering our products have been published, including three landmark clinical validation papers published in The New England Journal of Medicine for the Afirma and Percepta classifiers, respectively, and in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine for the Envisia classifier. We continue to build upon our extensive library of clinical evidence.
We believe our focus on developing clinically useful tests that change patient care is enabling us to set new standards in genomic test reimbursement. Our genomic classifiers in thyroid cancer, lung cancer and ILD/IPF, as well as the Prosigna breast 
cancer assay, are covered by Medicare. Our Afirma classifier, for use in thyroid cancer diagnosis, is now covered by every major health plan in the United States, which collectively insure more than 275 million people. We are contracted as an in-network service provider to health plans representing over 225 million people in the United States. We believe that our in-network status with private payers will help facilitate private insurer reimbursement for our Percepta and Envisia classifiers. The Prosigna test is covered by leading private payers in the United States and is widely reimbursed by government and private payers in the countries where it is available.
Patients access our tests through their physician. Our Afirma, Percepta and Envisia tests are used as part of the diagnostic process and genomic testing services are performed in our CLIA laboratory located in San Francisco, California, and marketed as laboratory developed tests. We perform slide preparation and staining for cytopathology on fine needle aspiration samples, for use with Afirma testing, in our reference laboratory in Austin, Texas. The Prosigna test is a FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic test that is performed on the nCounter Analysis System in laboratories worldwide, as well as in the United States.
Recent Developments
Acquisition of Decipher
On February 2, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Decipher Biosciences, Inc., or Decipher. Decipher is a commercial-stage precision oncology company, with a focus in urologic oncology specific to prostate and bladder cancers, and has a kidney cancer test in development. Through the planned acquisition, we expect to expand our presence into seven of the ten most common cancers in the United States, accelerating our expected revenue growth.
Under terms of the Merger Agreement, Decipher will become our wholly owned subsidiary. At the effective time of the Merger, or the Closing, we will pay $600 million in cash to Decipher security holders, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for cash, unpaid indebtedness, unpaid transaction expenses and the aggregate exercise prices of all Decipher options. 
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Decipher and us. The Closing is anticipated to occur by April 2021 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the Decipher stockholders and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The Merger Agreement also provides customary termination rights to each of the parties.

Impact of COVID-19
In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China, and began to spread globally, including to the United States and Europe, in the following months. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic and a public health emergency of international concern. The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is inherently uncertain at the time of this report. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in travel restrictions and in some cases, prohibitions of non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. As COVID-19 has spread, it has significantly impacted the health and economic environment around the world and many governments have closed most public establishments, including restaurants, workplaces and schools. Our customers, third-party contract manufacturers, suppliers and collaboration partners have been affected by the closure of hospitals, doctors' offices, manufacturing sites, or country borders, among other measures being put in place around the world. In April 2020, we announced certain cost-cutting measures in response to the pandemic, including cuts to executive and board of directors compensation, and employee furloughs. Although certain of these measures were later reversed, certain of our employees continue to work remotely. Similar measures taken by other companies in the medical industry and otherwise during the shutdown are having, and will continue to have, negative impact on the demand for medical care and diagnostic tests, which affects the frequency with which tests are prescribed, and the ability of doctors and hospitals to administer such tests. Further the inability to travel and conduct face-to-face meetings can also make it more difficult to expand utilization of our products into new geographies and to drive awareness of our products. These circumstances had a significant negative impact on our financial results during 2020.
Our Products
We believe our focus on answering clinical questions that produce actionable results; our comprehensive scientific approach to product development, including our use of RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing; and our development of rigorous clinical evidence to establish our tests’ performance and facilitate their reimbursement play critical roles in our ability to develop diagnostic tests that change clinical care. We currently offer genomic tests in thyroid cancer, lung cancer, IPF and breast cancer:
•Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier and Xpression Atlas. Our Afirma offerings include the Afirma GSC and Xpression Atlas. Our offerings are intended to provide physicians with clinically actionable results from a single fine needle aspiration, or FNA, biopsy. The Afirma GSC was developed with RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing and machine learning, and is used to identify patients with benign thyroid nodules among those with indeterminate cytopathology results in order to rule out unnecessary thyroid surgery. The Afirma product is the first of its kind to market, and we believe the market leader. Since Afirma testing became available in 2011, we estimate that we have helped more than 95,000 patients avoid having all or part of their thyroids removed.
The Afirma Xpression Atlas provides physicians with gene alteration content from the same FNA samples that are used in Afirma GSC testing and may help physicians decide with greater confidence on the surgical or therapeutic pathway for their patients. We commercially launched the Afirma XA in 2018 and in April 2020 introduced an expanded test that includes 905 DNA variants and 235 RNA fusion partners in 593 genes that are associated with thyroid cancer.
•Percepta Genomic Sequencing Classifier. The Percepta classifier improves lung cancer diagnosis following an inconclusive bronchoscopy by identifying patients with lung nodules who are at low risk of cancer and may avoid further, invasive procedures and those with a high risk of lung cancer, so they may obtain faster diagnosis and treatment. The test is built upon foundational "field of injury" science - through which genomic changes associated with lung cancer in current and former smokers can be identified with a simple brushing of a person's airway - without the need to sample the often hard-to-reach nodule directly. We commercially introduced the Percepta classifier in 2015, with clinical validation data subsequently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In June 2019, we launched the next-generation Percepta test, providing expanded lung cancer risk information to further inform treatment decisions. The Percepta classifier is the first product of its kind to be available commercially and the first to obtain Medicare coverage for improved lung cancer diagnosis.
•Envisia Genomic Classifier. The Envisia classifier improves diagnosis and prognosis of interstitial lung diseases, including IPF, by helping physicians identify the genomic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia, or UIP, without the need for diagnostic surgery. UIP is a hallmark of IPF and of poor prognosis across ILDs and is often difficult to distinguish even with the most advanced imaging technologies. Diagnostic surgery is risky, expensive and may not be viable for some patients. The Envisia test identifies UIP with high accuracy on patient samples that are obtained through transbronchial biopsy, a nonsurgical procedure that is commonly used in lung evaluation. Obtaining an accurate, timely IPF diagnosis is important given the availability of drugs that can slow the progression of this debilitating disease, as well as the need to avoid inappropriate and potentially harmful treatment. Additionally, prognostic information may help physicians determine treatment plans for patients with ILDs, including IPF. The Envisia classifier is the first product of its kind to market. We announced a final Medicare coverage policy for the Envisia classifier in March 2019, which was followed by the online publication of positive clinical validation and clinical utility data in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine in May 2019. Following these milestones, we initiated nationwide expansion for the test.
•Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay. The Prosigna test uses advanced genomic technology to inform next steps for patients with early-stage breast cancer, based on the genomic make-up of their disease. The test leverages a collection of 50 genes known as the PAM50 gene signature, and can provide a breast cancer patient and physician with a prognostic score indicating the probability of cancer recurrence during the next ten years. Outside of the United States, it is also utilized to provide cancer subtype classification information.
Physicians can use Prosigna to help guide therapeutic decisions so that patients receive therapeutic interventions, such as chemotherapy, only if clinically warranted. The in vitro diagnostic test is indicated in female breast cancer patients who have undergone surgery in conjunction with locoregional treatment consistent with standard of care, either as:
1.A prognostic indicator for distant recurrence‐free survival at ten years in post‐menopausal women with Hormone Receptor‐Positive (HR+), lymph node‐negative, Stage I or II breast cancer to be treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, when used in conjunction with other clinicopathological factors; or
2.A prognostic indicator for distant recurrence‐free survival at ten years in post‐menopausal women with Hormone Receptor‐Positive (HR+), lymph node‐positive (1‐3 positive nodes), Stage II breast cancer to be treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, when used in conjunction with other clinicopathological factors. The device is not intended for patients with 4 or more positive nodes.
The Prosigna test is cleared by the FDA for marketing in the United States for use on the nCounter Analysis System and is available for use when ordered by a physician. The test is performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, or FFPE, tissue. The Prosigna test has been CE-marked, and is available for use by healthcare professionals in the European Union and other countries that recognize the CE mark, as well as in Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. The test is covered by Medicare and leading private payers in the United States and is widely covered by government and private payers in the countries where it is available.
Our Pipeline
Our product pipeline reflects our strategy of answering clinical questions in our indications across the clinical care continuum. We develop new products using our RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing and machine learning platform and also strategically acquire complementary products through collaborations and acquisitions. In December 2019, we acquired the exclusive global rights to the nCounter Analysis System, positioning us to make our genomic tests available to physicians and patients in global markets through a distributed platform in which customers perform the tests in their local laboratories. This transaction also expands our existing genomic test offerings into new oncology indications of breast cancer and lymphoma. We 
believe the global market opportunity for our current and future pipeline products is over $50 billion annually. We expect to launch four new products in 2021:
•Nasal Swab Test for Early Lung Cancer Detection - In December 2020, we announced preliminary, cross-validation performance data showing that our noninvasive nasal swab test - the first of its kind - may enable early lung cancer detection and diagnosis. The preliminary findings specifically show that our novel genomic test has the potential to accurately classify lung cancer risk in patients with lung nodules so that these patients may obtain the prompt diagnosis and potential treatment they need or may be monitored noninvasively. These findings support those of a feasibility study whose results were shared at the CHEST Annual Meeting in October 2019. The in-development test uses “field of injury” technology to determine the likelihood that a lung nodule is cancerous by measuring gene expression patterns in cells collected from the nose. We plan to introduce the nasal swab test commercially in the United States in the second half of 2021 and complete the development of the test on the nCounter Analysis System for regulatory submission internationally by the end of 2022.
•Percepta Genomic Atlas – The Percepta Genomic Atlas will enable more patients with lung cancer to receive more-appropriate treatment sooner. The test will provide comprehensive genomic profiling information on small samples of the tumor biopsy used for diagnosis to inform treatment decision-making at the time of diagnosis. Data presented in December 2020 showed that the in-development test accurately detected known gene variants in lung cancer using bronchoscopy samples, including stage I, II and III cancers, with over 95% concordance to a reference next-generation sequencing assay. We plan to introduce the Percepta Genomic Atlas in the second half of 2021.
•Envisia Classifier the nCounter Analysis System – We are adapting our Envisia classifier for use on the nCounter Analysis System so that the test may be offered to physicians and patients in international markets by hospitals and laboratories that will perform the test locally. We expect to introduce the test before the end of 2021.
•LymphMark Lymphoma Subtyping Test - The LymphMark test is in development for use on the nCounter Analysis System as an aid in disease characterization and prognosis to support disease management for patients newly diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL. The LymphMark test utilizes gene-expression profiling of RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue to classify the “cell of origin” subtype of DLBCL tumors. The World Health Organization recommends gene-expression profiling for patients with DLBCL, given that certain subtypes are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, which may potentially be mitigated by more-specific treatments that are under development.
•Product Extensions - We expect to expand our portfolio of tests across all of our indications – including IPF, breast cancer and lymphoma – to inform treatment decisions at the time of diagnosis, similar to what we have done with the Afirma Xpression Atlas in thyroid cancer and plan with the Percepta Genomic Atlas in lung cancer. Because our diagnostic and prognostic tests are positioned early in the clinical care continuum, we have a unique opportunity to inform downstream decisions without the patient having to undergo further procedures to obtain additional tissue samples.
Additionally, we plan to develop tests further “upstream” in lung cancer to identify patients with precancerous changes that can potentially be treated with preventative therapies. In December 2020, we expanded our collaboration with the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson to include a large-scale, prospective clinical trial that will inform on feasibility of such future tests.
Platform for Global Expansion
In December 2019, we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to the nCounter Analysis System for in vitro diagnostic use and for the development and commercialization of in vitro diagnostic tests. We expect this instrument platform to enable a broad range of testing through its ability to simultaneously conduct multiplex testing of up to 800 RNA, DNA and protein targets. The nCounter Analysis System is simple to use and requires less than two hours of hands-on time, which is an up to 80 percent reduction compared to sequencing technology, making advanced genomic testing more accessible to patients through laboratories that previously may not have had the resources or expertise to perform such complex testing.
We believe the nCounter Analysis System is a key catalyst that is enabling our transformation into a leading global diagnostics company poised for long-term growth and our planned acquisition of Decipher Biosciences is expected to further position us for further growth.
Biopharmaceutical Collaborations
We believe the powerful clinical and scientific platform we use in the discovery and development of new products also provides multiple opportunities to monetize our assets through collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies. In developing our products, we have built or gained access to unique biorepositories that include extensive clinical cohorts and whole genome RNA sequencing data, which we believe are important to the development of new targeted therapies, determining clinical trial eligibility and guiding treatment selection. Further, we believe our expanded global footprint and move into new clinical areas in oncology, enabled by the nCounter Analysis System, will prove highly attractive to biopharmaceutical companies, which need access to patients worldwide for their targeted therapies.
As of December 31, 2020, we had established biopharmaceutical collaborations with Johnson & Johnson; Acerta Pharma, the hematology research and development arm of AstraZeneca plc; and Loxo Oncology, Inc., or Loxo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company; and Bayer. 
We also collaborate with the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson to advance the development and commercialization of novel diagnostic tests to detect lung cancer at its earliest stages, when the disease is most treatable. The collaboration with Johnson & Johnson, begun in December 2018, was formed to accelerate two key lung cancer programs for us: the commercialization of our Percepta GSC on our RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing platform, which was achieved in June 2019, and the development of the first noninvasive nasal swab test for early lung cancer detection. We announced preliminary cross-validation data for the in-development nasal swab test in December 2020 and plan to commercially introduce the test in the second half of 2021. Under terms of the agreement, we and Johnson & Johnson have combined clinical study cohorts involving more than 5,000 patients with multiple years of clinical outcome data.
In December 2020 we began an expanded collaboration with the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson, which will include a focus on the NOBLE trial, a 9,000-patient, prospective, multicenter clinical study. The NOBLE study was launched in July 2020 to identify genomic and other differences in lung cancer development and progression among patients with lung nodules detected by CT imaging. We believe the new study will position us to develop future tests that may benefit broader patient populations, including nonsmokers and those with pre-cancerous changes who are likely to develop lung cancer. Through our expanded collaboration, the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson is helping to fund the NOBLE trial and will have access to resulting data and the rights to any therapy developed as a results, while we retain all diagnostic rights.
Through our collaboration with Acerta Pharma, which we began in December 2019, we provide genomic information to support the biopharmaceutical company’s development of oncology therapeutics in lymphoma. 
In April 2018, we entered into a research collaboration with Loxo, which gave the biopharmaceutical company access to data derived from our Afirma XA platform for use in its development of highly selective medicines for patients with genetically defined cancers, including thyroid cancer. This collaboration, which supported Loxo’s precision medicine therapy development, concluded in February 2021, following FDA approval of the biopharmaceutical company’s RET-focused drug, Retevmo (selpercatinib). In December 2020, we began a program with Bayer to identify specific subsets of thyroid cancer patients who may benefit from biomarker-driven therapies.
Diagnostic Company Collaborations
We believe the nCounter Analysis System creates opportunities for us to enter into collaborations with other diagnostics companies who seek to make their non-competitive advanced genomic tests accessible to physicians and patients in international markets. We believe that expanding the menu of genomic tests available on the nCounter Analysis System will increase adoption of our tests on the platform. In addition, we expect to generate revenue through such partnerships by providing the reagents and kits for any diagnostic tests performed on the nCounter Analysis System. Longer term, we believe that having a comprehensive genomic testing menu on the nCounter Analysis System will position us to place more instruments into hospitals and reference laboratories worldwide.
In May 2020, we entered into a collaboration with CareDx through which CareDx will have exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for solid organ transplant-rejection tests on the nCounter Analysis System. In July 2020, we entered into an agreement for MAVIDx to develop ultra-high throughput genomic testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as well as other infectious diseases, including influenza, on the nCounter Analysis System. 
Market Opportunity
The majority of our current business is focused on developing and commercializing genomic classifiers that help resolve diagnostic uncertainty. We believe this is a critical healthcare issue that leads to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary surgeries, delayed or potentially harmful treatments and billions of wasted healthcare dollars each year. We also offer genomic tests designed to answer important questions at other points along the care continuum - often from the same patient samples used in diagnosis - to further help improve patient outcomes and the use of healthcare resources. We believe the total addressable market for our current tests - in thyroid cancer, lung cancer, IPF and breast cancer - is over $3 billion in the United States and Europe. We believe the global market opportunity for our current and pipeline products is over $50 billion annually.
Thyroid Market Opportunity for Our Afirma Solution
Each year in the United States, we estimate that more than 565,000 FNA biopsies are performed to assess patients with potentially cancerous thyroid nodules. Cytopathology is performed on each biopsy and we estimate that up to 30 percent of the results are indeterminate (not clearly benign or malignant). Physicians have traditionally recommended thyroid surgery to obtain a more definitive diagnosis. Following surgery, however, 70% to 80% of patients' nodules are diagnosed as benign, meaning the surgery was unnecessary. Such surgery is invasive, costly and often leads to the need for lifelong daily thyroid hormone replacement drugs. The Afirma classifier is included in most leading medical guidelines.
We believe the addressable market opportunity for our Afirma solution is $720 million in the United States and approximately $100 million in the European Union. We currently do not have meaningful operations or sales outside the United States.
In January 2012, we obtained Medicare coverage for our Afirma classifier. The test is covered by every major health plan in the United States, which collectively insure more than 275 million people. We are contracted as an in-network service provider to health plans representing over 225 million people in the United States. We estimate that approximately 20% of patients evaluated for thyroid cancer in the United States are covered by Medicare and the remaining 80% are covered by commercial plans or Medicaid or they are self-insured.
Lung Cancer Market Opportunity for Our Percepta Classifier
Lung cancer is often difficult to diagnose without invasive, risky and costly surgeries. Nearly 230,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year in the United States and more than 140,000 people die annually from the disease. We estimate that approximately 1.8 million to 2.0 million lung nodules are identified in patients in the United States each year and that doctors perform approximately 545,000 bronchoscopies on these patients in order to obtain a diagnosis. A bronchoscopy is 
a non-surgical procedure that is often used to evaluate patients with potentially cancerous lung nodules, but produces inconclusive results in up to 70% of cases. We estimate that the number of bronchoscopies performed would potentially increase - in lieu of more invasive procedures - if physicians had more confidence in the bronchoscopy procedure’s ability to provide clear results. Currently, we estimate that approximately 230,000 patients undergoing bronchoscopy have inconclusive results and could potentially benefit from our test.
We believe the addressable market opportunity for our Percepta product is approximately $490 million in the United States and over $200 million in Europe. We anticipate the market will expand significantly over the coming years as lung cancer screening programs are implemented in the United States and physicians embrace bronchoscopy as a standard, less-invasive diagnostic modality for evaluating lung nodules and lesions.
In May 2017, we obtained Medicare coverage for Percepta, making it the first genomic test to be covered for use in lung cancer screening and diagnosis. The test is available to nearly 60 million Medicare enrollees. We estimate that half of the patients evaluated for lung cancer in the United States are covered by Medicare.
We estimate that the total addressable global market for our in-development nasal swab test for earlier lung cancer detection is approximately $5.5 billion. In the United States alone, we estimate that about 750,000 patients with lung nodules found on CT scans – either through screening or incidentally – are referred to a pulmonologist for evaluation. Currently out of the approximately 10 million people in the United States who are eligible for annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT, only about 1.2 million people are getting screened. We believe the total number of people screened will increase should the United States Preventative Services Task Force’s recommendation to expand eligibility for annual screening be adopted. Additionally, we believe that by informing decision-making around which patients with lung nodules to work up and which to monitor, our nasal swab test may increase referrals to CT screening. 
Further, we estimate that the total addressable global market for a genomic test that can identify patients with precancerous changes is approximately $36 billion. This is based on the global rates of smoking and patients at risk for lung cancer who may be eligible for the nasal swab test to identify pre-cancerous changes. We believe this market will continue to grow in the coming years as populations with a history of smoking age into at-risk eligibility for assessment of lung cancer risk.
IPF Market Opportunity for Our Envisia Classifier
Each year in the United States and Europe, up to 220,000 patients are suspected of having an ILD, including IPF, which is among the most common and deadly of these lung-scarring diseases. IPF is notoriously difficult to diagnose, often leading to treatment delays, repeated misdiagnoses, patient distress and added healthcare expense. Physicians routinely use high-resolution computed tomography imaging to identify UIP, the pattern whose presence is essential to IPF diagnosis. This approach, however, frequently provides inconclusive results, leading many patients to require surgery to secure a more definitive diagnosis using surgical histopathology. These surgeries are risky and expensive, and many patients are too frail to undergo the procedure. Of the approximate 250,000 patients evaluated for ILD annually, we estimate that approximately 60%, or 151,000 patients receive an uncertain diagnosis and are candidates for our Envisia test.
We believe the addressable market opportunity for our Envisia product is approximately $435 million in the United States and up to $300 million in Europe.
In March 2019, we obtained final Medicare coverage for the Envisia classifier through the MolDX program, administered by Palmetto GBA. The Envisia classifier is the first genomic test to be covered by Medicare for use in IPF diagnosis, with the test available to the government health program’s nearly 60 million Medicare enrollees. We estimate that half of the patients evaluated for ILDs/IPF in the United States are covered by Medicare.
Breast Cancer Market Opportunity for Our Prosigna Test
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. It impacts 2.1 million women and causes 627,000 deaths each year. Following diagnosis, physicians have traditionally used clinical factors - tumor size, grade and nodal status - to help determine the risk of cancer recurrence and thus to help inform whether adjuvant chemotherapy should be added to endocrine treatment. We believe that historically this subjective approach led to women unnecessarily being exposed to toxic chemotherapy or to being undertreated.
The Prosigna assay measures RNA expression levels of 50 genes that provide a breast cancer patient and physician with a prognostic score indicating the probability of cancer recurrence over ten years, as well as information on the patient’s breast cancer genetic subtypes which can further inform treatment.
We estimate that the global early stage breast cancer recurrence market is significant, with approximately 375,000 patients potentially eligible for Prosigna annually. This is comprised of approximately 111,000 patients in the United States and 250,000 in the rest of the world. The Prosigna test is clinically validated in studies published in Annals of Oncology and the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The test is recommended in guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology in the United States. Medicare coverage for Prosigna has been in effect since October 2015. Outside of the United States, the test is included in leading medical guidelines, including from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, which in 2019 recommended use of the test. We estimate that the addressable market for Prosigna is approximately $275 million in the United States and $650 million in global markets.
LymphMark Lymphoma Subtyping Test
DLBCL is a heterogeneous group of cancers that represents the most common and one of the most aggressive forms of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. We estimate that there are approximately 95,000 patients diagnosed with DLBCL each year globally, including approximately 25,000 patients in the United States, who would be potential candidates for our test. We estimate that the total addressable market for LymphMark is approximately $350 million globally.
Scientific Background
In the past, clinicians made diagnoses from biopsy samples by looking at them under a microscope. Technology has advanced far beyond this, and scientists now have the ability to decipher genomic patterns that reside in the DNA and RNA of such biopsies. We search for patterns that tell us whether or not the biopsy contains the disease in question. We do this by using a whole-genome approach. This means we look at all of the human genes, including their expression patterns and their variants and mutations, rather than just looking at a few selected genes that we think may be important. This comprehensive measurement of the human genome allows us to detect signals from genes we may not have previously suspected to be involved in disease.
We use machine learning-based algorithms to match genomic patterns with clinical truth, or the true diagnosis. For example, when we train an algorithm on RNA sequencing data, we teach it to associate a set of expression patterns with disease and a different set of patterns with lack of disease. When algorithms are trained on enough examples with clinical truth, they learn to find that pattern in samples they have never encountered, thus allowing the algorithm to predict disease in a clinical setting.
Our core products are built around algorithms that help either rule in or rule out disease. Due to the complex, sometimes rare, subtypes of various diseases like cancer, we develop and train our machine learning algorithms using a diverse set of patient samples so that they are equipped to recognize patterns across the whole spectrum of conditions that may be encountered in the clinic.
Our process uses commercially available reagents and instruments with our own proprietary process and protocols, which results in RNA extraction from the range of small, minimally invasive biopsies used in our clinical development studies and our commercial laboratory tests.
Our Prosigna breast cancer prognostic test, acquired in December 2019, similarly utilizes machine learning-based algorithms to provide prognostic information for certain early-stage breast cancer patients. The RNA-based test uses a “PAM50” signature, comprised of 50 genes, to compare the gene expression profile of a patient’s tumor - from a surgically removed sample - with each of four intrinsic tumor subtypes to determine the degree of similarity. The results, in combination with a proliferation score and tumor size, produce an individualized Prosigna risk-of-recurrence score. The Prosigna test was adapted to be performed using the nCounter Analysis System so that it can be performed in local laboratories.
In addition to our primary tests in each of our clinical indications, our RNA sequencing platform also enables us to identify gene alterations such as variants and fusions, copy number and other information - from samples utilized in initial testing - that may inform next steps in patient care. We currently offer this capability in our thyroid cancer offerings as the Afirma Xpression Atlas, which is used to help inform surgical strategy and treatment options for patients whose thyroid nodules are confirmed or suspicious for cancer. We believe this capability may be especially useful in oncology and other diseases that are increasingly treated using therapies that target specific gene alterations.
Technology
Genomic Testing
Our technology approach for our genomic tests is comprised of a number of key attributes:
•Core Expertise in Broad-based Genomic Analysis. Our team of bioinformatics and computational scientists possess extensive knowledge of both existing computational methods as well as the capacity to develop proprietary methods as needed for algorithm design. We demonstrated our ability to utilize large amounts of genomic data with machine learning algorithms in the development of the original Afirma GEC on microarrays and substantially extended this capability in the development of the Afirma GSC by accessing genomic features through deep RNA sequencing. Our expertise allows us to use a combination of expression analysis as well as mutations and variants to build our sophisticated machine learning algorithms, all on the same platform. Additionally, we believe our technological capabilities enable us to adapt our genomic tests to other platforms, including the nCounter Analysis System for distribution to global markets.
•Platform-Agnostic Approach. We are not reliant on any one technology platform to measure genomic signals; in fact, we may take advantage of a multitude of genomic methodologies to develop future tests. When we developed the Afirma GEC in 2008, microarray technologies were a cost-effective discovery technology compared to other approaches that were nascent at the time. More recently, the rapid cost reductions achieved in next generation sequencing platforms have allowed us to pursue our whole genome approach to biomarker discovery using a range of genomic features obtained through both DNA and RNA sequencing. From this vast array of sequence data, our algorithms select those genomic signals that inform on the disease in question, in the relevant biopsy sample. We continue to evaluate potential opportunities to use new genomic discoveries and technologies to further improve patient care.
•Proprietary Capabilities in Analyzing Small, Heterogeneous Cytology Samples. We have developed proprietary technology, intellectual property and know-how for optimized methods for extraction and analysis of nanogram quantities of RNA from small biopsy samples. Our focus is on redefining clinical truth, using patient samples obtained through less-invasive techniques, thereby increasing access to our technology by a larger patient population. While others can extract RNA from these small biopsies, we believe our process is optimized and scaled for high-throughput clinical testing and large-scale clinical development studies, such as those involving high-density microarrays and next-generation sequencing.
•Precision and Reproducibility. We have in place standard operating procedures governing reagents, materials, instruments and controls and extensive experience from numerous verification studies performed for our tests. We apply the same high-quality control methods that were developed for our reagents and processes, along with our proprietary software for automation, sample tracking, data quality control and statistical analysis, to our development process.
nCounter Analysis System
In December 2019, we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to the nCounter Analysis System for in vitro diagnostic use and for the development and commercialization of in vitro diagnostic tests. Currently, the Prosigna breast cancer assay is the only commercially-available test on the platform.
The nCounter Analysis System can simultaneously analyze RNA, DNA or protein targets, as well as gene mutations, fusions and copy number variations, in up to 800 genes. The system utilizes proprietary chemistry that allows the measurement of subtle changes in the activity of multiple genes from minute amounts of a biological sample, with high sensitivity and precision. This chemistry also obviates the need for amplification or other steps that can be cumbersome and time-consuming or may introduce the possibility of measurement errors. As a result, the nCounter Analysis System enables easy-to-use genomic testing with simple workflow that requires less than two hours of hands-on time - an up to 80 percent reduction compared to sequencing technology - making advanced genomic testing more accessible to patients through laboratories that previously may not have had the resources or expertise to perform such complex testing.
We believe the nCounter Analysis System’s sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities will provide a robust platform for our genomic classifiers, enabling us to offer them in a kit format that can be performed locally in laboratories worldwide where the instrument is installed. Additionally, we believe that we can perform our genomic classifiers on the nCounter Analysis 
System in our own CLIA lab, enabling other, smaller-volume labs in the United States to offer our tests without the need to invest in an nCounter Analysis System instrument, while also enabling us to enhance our margins.
We expect to begin offering the Envisia classifier, for use in the diagnosis of ILDs including IPF, to international customers by the end of 2021 as a kit-based test that runs on the nCounter Analysis System. We expect our in-development nasal swab classifier, for use in lung cancer diagnosis, to follow on the nCounter Analysis System in 2022, after the test becomes available in our CLIA lab in the United States in the second half of 2021. The nCounter Analysis System can also run additional tests developed by us, as well as by potential diagnostics or biopharmaceutical partners seeking access to global markets.
Studies Validating Test Performance and Clinical Utility
In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the “ACCE” model as a paradigm for establishing evidence to confirm the safety and effectiveness of molecular diagnostic tests. ACCE derives its name from the main criteria for evaluating such tests, including analytic validity, clinical validity and clinical utility. This model has been adopted by most technology assessment groups, professional societies and payers. We fully embrace this paradigm of evidence development and we strive to provide the highest level of scientific evidence to support our test claims.
We believe that developing an extensive library of rigorous clinical evidence to support our tests is critical to driving inclusion in clinical guidelines, securing reimbursement and gaining physician adoption. We make our published research, abstracts from medical conferences and other product information available on our website at www.veracyte.com. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Afirma classifiers are supported by more than 30 published scientific studies. These include a prospective, multicenter clinical validation study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, which suggested that the test can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary surgeries, compared to traditional diagnostic approaches. They also include a clinical validation study with patients from this same cohort, which was published in JAMA Surgery and show that the next-generation Afirma GSC can identify 30 percent more patients who may potentially avoid unnecessary surgery. 
Our Percepta test is supported by seven published scientific studies, including data published in The New England Journal of Medicine, which demonstrate the test’s accuracy in identifying patients who are at low risk of cancer following inconclusive results from bronchoscopy. These patients may then be monitored with CT scans in lieu of undergoing surgery - a frequent next step at this juncture of the clinical pathway. A clinical utility study published in the CHEST journal showed that use of the test reduced unnecessary surgeries in the target patient population, compared to physicians’ plans prior to Percepta testing.
Our Envisia classifier is supported by clinical data published in seven peer-reviewed journals. These include a prospective clinical validation study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, which showed that the Envisia test achieved high specificity, meaning it would be expected to identify more than two-thirds of patients with usual interstitial pneumonia, or UIP, the hallmark of IPF, while minimizing the number of false positive results. In comparison, data show that high-resolution CT (HRCT) imaging, which is typically used in IPF diagnosis, has a sensitivity of just 43 percent for UIP.
The Prosigna breast cancer prognostic test is supported by multiple clinical studies involving thousands of female patients with early-stage breast cancer. These include a large clinical validation study published in Annals of Oncology. In this study of 1,478 patients, researchers found that the Prosigna risk of recurrence score added a “highly significant further increase in prognostic information” compared to a clinical linear predictor alone. Data demonstrating the test’s clinical performance, clinical utility, cost-effectiveness and analytical validation have been published in over a dozen peer-reviewed journals including the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Journal of the National Cancer Institute and JAMA Oncology among others.
Commercial Operations
In January 2021, we formalized a new General Manager-based structure to advance our growing global business, which includes two business approaches and products in multiple clinical indications. Under this structure, we appointed a General Manager, Endocrinology, Breast Cancer and Lymphoma; and a General Manager, Pulmonology. Each role has full global responsibility and accountability for specific indications, including pipeline development, strategy, marketing and sales, reimbursement and field-based medical affairs. 
Our sales force consists of approximately 50 sales team members under each General Manager in the United States (thyroid cancer and pulmonology). 
We have approximately 15 sales team members, including Country Managers, who promote the Prosigna test globally through laboratory and channel partnerships, in addition to a marketing team in Europe. 
To date, nearly all of our revenue has been derived from customers we serve in the United States. Through December 31, 2020, we derived most of our revenue from our Afirma solution, including cytopathology services and the Afirma assays.
In addition to direct sales, industry trade shows or events typically provide us with an opportunity to share important product and research updates and to interact with key opinion leaders who impact our business. With customers less accessible in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we seized new opportunities to engage with them digitally. We increased our use of digital technology, which included virtual speaker programs and webinars among customers nationwide, conducting email campaigns, product websites, search engine optimization and other online tactics that brought timely, relevant information to our customers in a more-personalized format. We envision increasingly utilizing digital strategies beyond the pandemic to further strengthen our customer relationships and deepen physician understanding of our tests and their value in the evolving precision medicine landscape.
We also anticipate continuing to have a presence at a number of select industry conferences, which may include the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, Annual Meeting; the Annual Scientific and Clinical Congress of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, or AACE, the Annual Meeting of the American Thyroid Association, or ATA, and the Endocrine Society’s Annual Meeting, or ENDO; key pulmonology conferences such as the American Thoracic Society’s International Conference, or ATS, and the American College of Chest Physician’s CHEST Annual Meeting; and, in breast cancer, the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.
Prosigna is currently our only product generating revenue in global markets. Commercialization efforts for Prosigna involve securing reimbursement, selling test kits to institutions and medical centers that already own or lease nCounter Analysis Systems, and driving physician demand for the test. 
Laboratory Operations
We currently perform all genomic testing in thyroid cancer, lung cancer and IPF in South San Francisco, California. For Afirma testing, we perform slide preparation and staining for cytopathology on FNA samples in Austin, Texas. 
We receive samples for testing directly from the following sources:
•FNAs for Afirma Genomic Testing Only. Institutions and other clients, such as laboratories, that perform their own cytopathology may send us FNA samples from indeterminate results to perform Afirma genomic testing. We receive over 70% of our Afirma test volume from this source and it is the fastest-growing segment of our business.
•FNAs for Cytopathology and Reflexed Afirma Genomic Testing. We receive FNA samples from ordering physicians for cytopathology assessment and if results are indeterminate, Afirma genomic testing is to be performed. We partner with Thyroid Cytopathology Partners, or TCP, to perform the cytopathology review.
•Bronchoscopy Samples for Percepta Classifier. Institutions send us samples collected during the bronchoscopy procedure and order genomic testing with the Percepta classifier when bronchoscopy results are inconclusive. These samples are collected using a bronchial airway brushing during a bronchoscopy procedure for lung cancer diagnosis.
•Bronchoscopy Samples for Envisia Classifier. Institutions send us samples to help better differentiate IPFs from other ILDs without the need for surgery. These samples are collected using transbronchial biopsy during a bronchoscopy procedure.
We rely on TCP to provide professional cytopathology diagnoses on thyroid FNA samples pursuant to a pathology services agreement. Our agreement with TCP is effective until October 31, 2022 and thereafter automatically renews every year unless either party provides notice of intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the then-current term.
Our Prosigna breast cancer test is performed on the nCounter Analysis System in laboratories internationally and in the United States. We believe that our state-of-the-art laboratory space in South San Francisco, California, has sufficient laboratory capacity to accommodate volume growth for our existing and pipeline products, as well as for Prosigna testing on the nCounter Analysis System.
Our Quality Assurance team provides oversight on quality, licensing and regulatory compliance and maintenance for both of our laboratories to ensure data integrity and consistent, validated processes. The team also oversees the quality systems used in research and development, client services, billing operations and sales and marketing. 
Reimbursement Strategy
We employ a multi-pronged strategy designed to achieve broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests in the United States and internationally:
•Compile a Growing Library of Peer-reviewed Studies that Demonstrate the Test Is Effective. To date, several peer-reviewed articles and review papers have been published and have helped support our efforts aimed at widespread adoption and reimbursement of our genomic tests. In each disease area we pursue, we intend to conduct studies in order to develop robust library of evidence.
•Meet the Evidence Standards Necessary to Be Consistent with Leading Clinical Guidelines. We believe inclusion in leading clinical practice guidelines plays an important role in payers' coverage decisions. For example, the data published on Afirma to date is consistent with the recommendations of the widely-recognized American Thyroid Association and National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines.
•Execute an Internal Managed Care and Claims Adjudication Function as Part of Our Core Business Operations.  We believe that obtaining adequate and widespread reimbursement is a critical factor in our long-term success. We employ a team of in-house claims processing and reimbursement specialists who work with payers, physician practices and patients to obtain maximum reimbursement.
•Collaborate with Network of Key Opinion Leaders. Key opinion leaders are able to impact clinical practice by publishing research and determining whether new tests should be integrated into practice guidelines. We collaborate with key opinion leaders early in the development process to ensure our clinical studies are designed and executed in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefits of our tests to patients, physicians and payers. Ongoing studies to support real world experience with our tests are also a key component of our efforts to collaborate with physician thought leaders.
•Established Payer Relationships and In-network Contracts. We believe that positive engagement with payers leads to coverage decisions and facilitates our efforts on coverage and contract decisions for subsequent tests.
Coverage, Coding and Reimbursement
United States
Revenue from our tests comes from several sources, including commercial third-party payers, such as insurance companies and health maintenance organizations, government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and patients. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which provide health care to almost one in every three Americans. For any particular geographic region, Medicare claims are processed at the local level by Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs.
Medicare generally covers molecular diagnostic tests through the MolDX program, administered by the MAC, Palmetto GBA. Medicare has covered our Afirma classifier testing since 2012 and Percepta classifier testing since 2017. We received Medicare coverage for our Envisia classifier testing in 2019. The Prosigna test achieved Medicare coverage in 2015. We estimate that Medicare covers approximately 20% of patients evaluated for thyroid cancer, approximately 50% of patients evaluated for lung cancer and breast cancer, and approximately 70% of patients evaluated for ILD, including IPF.
Since 1984, Medicare has paid for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, or CDLTs, on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS under section 1833(h) of the Social Security Act, or the SSA. Section 216(a) of the Protecting Access to 
Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, added section 1834A to the SSA. The statute required extensive revisions to the Medicare CLFS coding, rate setting processes, and laboratory payment reporting for CDLTs, and creates a new subcategory of CDLTs called ADLTs with separate reporting and payment requirements.
In 2016, CMS issued the final rule to implement the requirements of PAMA, which significantly revised the Medicare payment system for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests. The final rule was implemented on January 1, 2018 for the private payer rate-based fee schedule required by PAMA. Under the final rule, for CDLTs furnished on or after January 1, 2018, the amount Medicare pays is equal to the weighted median of private payer rates for the CDLT.
Prior to the implementation on January 1, 2018, the allowable Medicare rate for our Afirma GSC was $3,200. From January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020, the allowable Medicare rate for our Afirma test under PAMA increased to $3,600.
In December 2019, through the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, Congress delayed the next data reporting period under PAMA from 2020 to 2021 for final payments made between January 1 and June 30, 2019, extending the applicability of the payment rates based on 2017 reporting by one year through December 31, 2021. Afirma will continue to be paid at $3,600 through that date. The 2020 Medicare payment rate for Prosigna based on the volume-weighted median of private payer rates under PAMA will be $2,510.21. In 2021, Prosigna’s rate will decrease by 15% to approximately $2,134. The volume-weighted median of these private payer rates for final payments made from January through June 2019 (and now reported January through March 2021) will now set the Medicare payment rate for the Afirma classifier and for Prosigna from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024.
We submit claims to payers directly for the Afirma GSC, using a unique American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code. Effective January 1, 2021, we were issued a new Category I CPT code number (81546) for the Afirma GSC test, which is priced at the same rate as the prior Afirma GEC CPT code (81545). FNA samples are also received for cytopathology, for which we bill both the technical and professional component using established CPT codes. Effective January 1, 2021, we also obtained a Proprietary Laboratory Analysis, or PLA, code for the Afirma Xpression Atlas that was priced by CMS at $2,920, and a PLA code for the Afirma Medullary Thyroid Cancer test, which will be gap-fill priced in 2021 and we expect to have a rate on the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule, or CLFS January 1, 2022. Obtaining a CPT code is not a guarantee that a service will be considered medically necessary and be reimbursed by Medicare or a private payer, but we view obtaining these codes as a step toward further establishing reimbursement for these services.
We bill payers directly for the Percepta classifier using an “unlisted” CPT code until we obtain a specific code for the test. In September 2020, CMS, approved new ADLT status for the Envisia classifier and established a Medicare reimbursement rate of $5,500 for the test. For the six-month period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending March 31, 2021, Veracyte will collect private-payer payment rate data for the test, the median of which will be used by CMS to determine the Medicare pricing, beginning July 1, 2021. During the nine-month period prior to the new pricing, the Envisia classifier will be reimbursed at the $5,500 rate for all Medicare patients. The Envisia classifier has been a covered benefit for Medicare patients since 2019.
Currently, labs in the United States that perform Prosigna testing on their own nCounter Analysis Systems bill payers directly using the CPT code that is specific to the Prosigna test, 81520. We expect that, when we perform Prosigna testing in our own CLIA certified lab that we will bill payers directly for Prosigna testing.
State Medicaid programs typically make their own decisions with respect to coverage for our tests, as do private payers. We rely on a small number of third-party payers for a significant portion of our revenue, the loss of one or more of which would have a negative effect on our business. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, revenue was represented by the indicated percent for each payer:
•Medicare accounted for 24%, 26% and 29% of our revenue; and 
•UnitedHealthcare, our largest private payer, accounted for 11%, 11% and 12% of our revenue.
Outside the United States
Outside of the United States, we bill hospital and laboratory customers directly for test kits they order, which currently consist of Prosigna test kits. Our customers subsequently bill third-party payers for reimbursement. Prosigna test marketing has initially targeted private and cash-pay markets in Europe. We will continue to drive reimbursement efforts in Europe and other global markets through the development of clinical and other evidence to support Prosigna’s inclusion in guidelines and coverage programs.
Competition
We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets we target with our advanced genomic tests include:
•the ability of the test to answer the appropriate clinical question at the right point in the clinical pathway;
•the quality and strength of clinical validation and utility data;
•confidence in diagnostic results backed by analytical verification data;
•the extent of reimbursement and in-network payer contracts;
•inclusion in practice guidelines;
•cost-effectiveness; and
•local testing near the patient and ease of use.
We believe we compete favorably on the factors described above with our Afirma solution and are positioning ourselves to compete effectively on these factors with our first-to-market Percepta and Envisia classifiers. Another competitive factor that we believe will become increasingly important for advanced genomic tests offered within and outside of the United States is that they be available as distributed kits on an instrument platform with broad functionality to justify the capital expense. We believe our plans to adapt our genomic tests to the nCounter Analysis System, which already can run the Prosigna test, will further enhance our tests’ attractiveness to hospitals and laboratories globally.
Our principal competition for the Afirma solution comes from traditional methods used by physicians to diagnose thyroid cancer. Physicians in the United States have historically recommended that patients with indeterminate diagnoses from cytopathology results be considered for surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid to rule out cancer. This practice has been the standard of care in the United States, as well as in many international markets, for many years, and we continue to educate physicians about the benefits of our test in order to change clinical practice.
We also face competition from companies and academic institutions that use next generation sequencing technology or other methods to measure mutational markers such as BRAF and KRAS, along with numerous other mutations. These organizations include Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc., CBLPath, Inc./University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and others who are developing new products or technologies that may compete with our tests. In the future, we may also face competition from companies developing new products or technologies.
With the Percepta and Envisia tests, we believe our primary competition will similarly come from traditional methods used by physicians to diagnose the related diseases. For the Percepta test, we expect competition from companies focused on lung cancer such as Biodesix, Inc. and Oncocyte Corporation. We also anticipate facing potential competition from companies offering or developing approaches for assessing malignancy risk in patients with lung nodules using alternative samples such as blood, urine or sputum, including Biodesix, Inc. and Guardant Health, Inc. However, such "liquid biopsies" are currently predominantly used later in the diagnostic paradigm; for example, to inform treatment decisions for cancer or to gauge risk of recurrence or response to treatment.
In the breast cancer diagnostics market, the Prosigna test competes with Exact Sciences Corporation’s Oncotype Dx, a service for gene expression analysis performed in a central laboratory in Redwood City, California. We also face competition from companies such as Agendia, Inc. and bioTheranostics, Inc., which is expected to be acquired by Hologic, Inc., which also offer centralized laboratories that profile gene or protein expression in breast cancer. Outside the United States, we also face regional competition from Myriad Genetics, Inc., and its product EndoPredict test for breast cancer recurrence.
In general, we also face competition from commercial laboratories, such as Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, and Sonic Healthcare USA with strong infrastructure to support the commercialization of diagnostic services. We face potential competition from companies such as Illumina, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., both of which have entered the clinical diagnostics market. Other potential competitors include companies that develop diagnostic products, such as Roche Diagnostics, a division of Roche Holding Ltd, Siemens AG and Qiagen N.V.
Competitors may develop their own versions of our solution in countries in which we do not have patents or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging the use of their solution by physicians in other countries.
Many of our potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop products with prices lower than ours, which could be viewed by physicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our solution, or offer solutions at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the list price of our solutions and affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to change clinical practice in a meaningful way or compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our products, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As we add new tests and services, we will face many of these same competitive risks for these new tests.
Regulation
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA
As a clinical reference laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. We are subject to CLIA, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that test specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. Under CLIA, which is administered by CMS, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations we perform and to comply with standards covering personnel qualifications, facilities administration, quality systems, inspections, and proficiency testing. We must maintain CLIA compliance and certification to sell our tests and be eligible to bill for diagnostic services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.
Moreover, if one of our clinical reference laboratories is out of compliance with CLIA requirements, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, as well as directed plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties. If we were to be found out of compliance with CLIA requirements and subjected to sanctions, our business could be harmed.
We have historically held CLIA certifications to perform testing at our South San Francisco and Austin, Texas laboratory locations. To renew our CLIA certificates, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards.  Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make random inspections of our clinical reference laboratories. If we in the future fail to maintain CLIA certificates in our South San Francisco or Austin, Texas laboratory locations we would be unable to bill for services provided by state and federal healthcare programs, as well as many private third-party payers, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
State Laboratory Licensing
California Laboratory Licensing
In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under CLIA, licensure is required and maintained for our South San Francisco clinical reference laboratory under California law. Such laws establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical reference laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, California laws mandate proficiency testing, which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory.
If our clinical reference laboratory is out of compliance with California standards, the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH, may suspend, restrict or revoke our license to operate our clinical reference laboratory, assess substantial civil money penalties, or impose specific corrective action plans. Any such actions could materially affect our business. We maintain a current license in good standing with CDPH. However, we cannot provide assurance that CDPH will at all times in the future find us to be in compliance with all such laws.
New York Laboratory Licensing
Our clinical reference laboratories are required to be licensed by New York, under New York laws and regulations before we receive specimens from New York State. The license establishes standards for:
•quality management systems;
•qualifications, responsibilities, and training;
•facility design and resource management;
•pre-analytic, analytic (including validation and quality control), and post-analytic systems; and
•quality assessments and improvements.
New York law also mandates proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under New York state law, regardless of whether such laboratories are located in New York. If a laboratory is out of compliance with New York statutory or regulatory standards, the New York State Department of Health, or NYSDOH, may suspend, limit, revoke or annul the laboratory's New York license, censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties. Statutory or regulatory noncompliance may result in a laboratory's operator being found guilty of a misdemeanor under New York law. NYSDOH also must approve the laboratory developed tests before the test is offered in New York; approval has been received for the Afirma GEC and the Percepta classifier. Should we be found out of compliance with New York laboratory standards of practice, we could be subject to such sanctions, which could harm our business. We maintain a current license in good standing with NYSDOH for our South San Francisco and Austin laboratories. We cannot provide assurance that the NYSDOH will at all times find us to be in compliance with applicable laws.
Other States' Laboratory Licensing
In addition to New York and California, other states require licensing of out-of-state laboratories under certain circumstances. Pennsylvania, Maryland and Rhode Island require licenses to test specimens from patients in those states and Florida requires a license to receive specimens from a clinical laboratory in that state. We have obtained licenses from states where we believe we are required to be licensed, and believe we are in compliance with applicable licensing laws.
From time to time, we may become aware of other states that require out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure in order to accept specimens from the state, and it is possible that other states do have such requirements or will have such requirements in the future. If we identify any other state with such requirements or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to comply with such requirements.
United States Regulation of Laboratory Testing
Food and Drug Administration: Diagnostic Kits
Diagnostic kits, including collection systems that are sold and distributed in the United States are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. Devices subject to FDA regulation must undergo premarket review prior to commercialization unless the device is of a type exempted from such review. In addition, manufacturers of medical devices must comply with various regulatory requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and implementing regulations promulgated under that Act. Entities that fail to comply with FDA requirements may be subject to issuance of inspectional observations on Form FDA-483, untitled or warning letters, recalls, import detentions, seizures, or injunctions, including orders to cease manufacturing and can be liable for civil money penalties or criminal prosecution.
The FDC Act sets forth the classifications of medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and prescribes the levels of controls appropriate for each of the three classes to help ensure reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are considered to be low risk and are exempt from FDA premarket notification requirements. Class I devices are subject to general regulatory controls. When general controls are considered insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, but there is sufficient information to establish special controls to provide such assurance, FDA will classify the device as a Class II device. For most Class II devices, the FDC Act requires the submission to FDA of a premarket notification, referred to as a “510(k),” which must provide data and information showing that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, referred to as a predictive device, with respect to the indications for use and the product’s technological characteristics. If the data and information are sufficient to show that the device is as safe and effective as the predicate device, FDA issues a Substantially Equivalent letter clearing the device for marketing. 
If there is insufficient information to support classifying a device into Class I or Class II and the device is life-sustaining or life-supporting or is substantially important in preventing illness or injury or presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury, FDA places the device into Class III. Class III devices are considered the highest risk devices and generally require significant data and information, including testing data and data from nonclinical and clinical studies, to provide reasonable assurance of the device's safety and effectiveness. Class III devices require the submission and FDA approval of a premarket application, or PMA, before they can be marketed.
Certain devices are classified as Class III devices automatically, by operation of law, when the device does not have a predicate device or is found not to be substantially equivalent to a predicate device. If there is sufficient evidence to show that the device is a lower risk device, a manufacturer may ask FDA to reclassify the device into Class II or Class I by submitting a De Novo classification request. When FDA reclassifies a device through the De Novo process, other manufacturers of the same device type do not necessarily have to submit a De Novo request or a PMA in order to legally market the device. Instead, manufacturers can submit a 510(k), unless the device has been classified as 510(k) exempt, to legally market their device, because the device that was the subject of the original De Novo request can serve as a predicate device for a substantial equivalence determination. If FDA does not issue an order granting the De Novo request for reclassification, the device will remain a Class III device and be subject to PMA requirements to obtain marketing authorization. 
Establishments that manufacture or distribute FDA-related medical devices, including manufacturers, repackagers and relabelers, specification developers, and initial importers, are required to register and list their device products with the FDA.
Devices that may be legally marketed are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. These include: good manufacturing practice for medical devices as set out in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, labeling regulations, restrictions on promotion and advertising, the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR (which requires manufacturers to report to the FDA), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report certain recalls and field actions to the FDA). Certain corrections and market removals may also be subject to FDA’s recall regulation and procedures. 
The FDA has issued a regulation outlining specific requirements for "specimen transport and storage containers." "Specimen transport and storage containers" are medical devices "intended to contain biological specimens, body waste, or body exudate during storage and transport" so that the specimen can be destroyed or used effectively for diagnostic examination. A specimen transport and storage container that is not labeled or otherwise represented as sterile is classified as a Class I exempt device, which means that the device is exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement and the QSR, except for recordkeeping and complaint handling requirements. These 510(k) exempt devices are still subject to MDR requirements, the reporting of corrections and removals, and establishment registration and product listing. 
In our FDA registration, we have listed the containers we provide for collection and transport of Afirma GEC or GSC and Percepta samples from a physician to our clinical reference laboratory as Class I devices in accordance with the classification of regulation for the specimen transport and storage container. We also plan to list our sample collection containers for Envisia samples with the FDA as Class I devices. If the FDA were to determine that our sample collection containers are not Class I devices, we would be required to file 510(k) applications and obtain FDA clearance to manufacture and market the containers, which could be time consuming and expensive.
The FDA enforces the requirements described above by various means, including inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an Untitled Letter or Warning Letter to more severe sanctions such as:
•fines, injunctions, and civil money penalties;
•recall or seizure of products;
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; and
•criminal prosecution.
Federal Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests and Research Use Only Products
Clinical laboratory tests like our proprietary genomic tests are regulated under CLIA, as administered by CMS, as well as by applicable state laws. Clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory are referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, by the FDA. Currently, FDA believes these tests meet the definition of a device under the FDC Act; however, the FDA is currently exercising enforcement discretion for LDTs, meaning that FDA is not enforcing the device regulations that FDA has stated apply to clinical laboratories performing a LDT , although FDA may continue to enforce device regulations with respect to reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs. We believe that the Afirma, Percepta and Envisia classifiers are LDTs for which FDA is currently exercising its enforcement discretion. In October 2014, the FDA published a draft guidance document proposing a framework for the regulation of LDTs. In November 2016, the FDA announced that it would not finalize guidance and would instead work with the new Administration, Congress and stakeholders on an updated framework. In January 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper on LDTs in which it synthesized stakeholder feedback and outlined a substantially revised "possible approach" to the oversight of 
LDTs, which did not represent a formal position of the FDA, and is not enforceable. In a December 2018 statement, FDA said that there is a need for “a unified approach to the regulation of in vitro clinical tests to protect patient safety, support innovation, and keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology that’s helping us find new treatments for disease,” and listed key principles of an approach it would support. In August 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, announced a new policy purporting to rescind prior FDA guidance documents and other informal issuances regarding premarket review of LDT and determining that FDA must engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking in order to require premarket review of LDTs. It is unclear whether the HHS policy will remain in effect with the change in Administration following the U.S. general election in November 2020; whether this HHS measure will compel the FDA to formalize earlier enforcement discretionary policies and informal guidance documents through notice-and-comment rulemaking and/or impose further restrictions on LDTs; or whether Congress will enact legislation changing the regulation of LDTs. 
Some of the materials we use for our tests and that we may use for future tests are in vitro diagnostic products intended and labeled for research use only, or RUO, or investigational use only, or IUO. An RUO product cannot be used for any human clinical purpose and must be labeled "For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures." RUOs are a separate regulatory category and include in vitro diagnostic devices that are in the laboratory research phase of development. They are therefore not subject to most FDA regulatory requirements so long as they are properly labeled and used in accordance with such labeling. RUOs cannot be marketed with any claims that the device is safe, effective, or has diagnostic utility, or is intended for human clinical diagnostic or prognostic use. In November 2013, the FDA issued final guidance titled “Distribution of In-Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only” regarding the distribution, use, and labeling of in vitro diagnostic products labeled RUO or IUO. The FDA has advised that if evidence demonstrates that a product is inappropriately labeled for research or investigational use only, the device would be considered misbranded and adulterated within the meaning of the FDC Act. In the guidance, FDA stated that the manufacturer’s objective intent for an RUO or IUO product’s intended use will be determined by examining the totality of circumstances, including advertising, instructions for clinical interpretation, presentations that describe clinical use, and specialized technical support, surrounding the distribution of the product in question.
We cannot predict the ultimate form or impact of any such RUO/IUO, LDT or other guidance and the potential effect on our solutions or materials used to perform our diagnostic services. While we qualify all materials used in our diagnostic services according to CLIA regulations, we cannot be certain that the FDA might not promulgate rules or issue guidance documents that could affect our ability to purchase materials necessary for the performance of our diagnostic services. Should any of the reagents obtained by us from vendors and used in conducting our diagnostic services be affected by future regulatory actions, our business could be adversely affected by those actions, including increasing the cost of service or delaying, limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents necessary to perform the service.
We cannot provide any assurance that FDA premarket review or other requirements will not be imposed in the future for our diagnostic services, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. Legislative proposals addressing oversight of LDTs were introduced in recent years, most recently the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act of 2018 in December 2018, and we expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our tests or to develop and introduce new tests.
If premarket review, clearance, or approval, is required for the tests that we market as LDTs, our business could be negatively affected until such review is completed and clearance or approval to market is obtained, and the FDA could require that we stop selling our tests pending premarket clearance or approval. If our tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about the legal status of our services, if we are required by the FDA to label them investigational, or if FDA limits the use and corresponding labeling claims, order levels may decline and reimbursement may be adversely affected. The regulatory process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical studies and submitting to FDA a premarket notification to obtain clearance or submitting a De Novo classification request or PMA to obtain approval to market the device. If clearance or approval is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that our tests will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, nor can there be any assurance that approved labeling claims or labeling claims subject to cleared indications for use will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our solutions. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to heightened requirements of the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. We may also decide voluntarily to pursue FDA premarket review of our tests to obtain marketing clearance or approval if we determine that doing so would be appropriate.
Privacy and Fraud and Abuse Compliance
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by health care providers, such as us. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. In 2009, Congress amended HIPAA through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. The implementing regulations of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, were last modified in 2013 and resulted in significant changes to the privacy, security, breach notification, and enforcement requirements with which we must comply. Among these changes, covered entities are now vicariously liable for violations of HIPAA resulting from acts or omissions of their business associates where the business associate is an agent of the covered entity and was acting within the scope of its agency, regardless of whether the covered entity and business associate entered into a business associate agreement in compliance with HIPAA. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties.
We have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with HIPAA’s privacy, security, and breach notification requirements. We may not use or disclose protected health information in any form, including electronic, written, or oral, in a manner that is not permitted under HIPAA, and we are required to implement security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the electronic protected health information that we create, receive, maintain, or transmit. While we have some flexibility in determining which security safeguards are reasonable and appropriate to implement for our operations, it nonetheless requires significant effort and expense to ensure continuing compliance with the HIPAA security rule. We are also required to comply with the administrative simplification standards under HIPAA when we conduct the electronic transactions regulated by HIPAA, including by using standard code sets and formats and standardized identifiers for health plans and providers. The requirements under HIPAA and its implementing regulations may change periodically and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially costlier than under current requirements.
In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our business. In particular, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which was enacted in California in 2018 and components of which went into effect on January 1, 2020.  The CCPA, among other things, requires covered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers concerning the collection and sale of personal information, and gives such consumers the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. Amendments to the CCPA have been made since its enactment, and it remains unclear what, if any, further amendments will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. 
Recent developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding the processing of personal data from Europe. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in the European Union on May 25, 2018, applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to European Union users. The GDPR creates new compliance obligations applicable to our business, which could cause us to change our business practices, and increases financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements).
New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future from time to time. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements to which we are aware that we are subject. However, we can provide no assurance that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
Corporate Practice of Medicine
Numerous states, including California and Texas, have enacted laws prohibiting corporations such as us from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. This prohibition is generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. Violation of this prohibition may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us or the professional through licensing proceedings. The pathologists who review and classify thyroid FNA cytopathology results for Afirma are employed by TCP, a Texas professional association, pursuant to services agreement between us and TCP. Pursuant to the agreement, we pay TCP a monthly fee on a per FNA basis, and TCP manages and supervises the pathologists who perform the cytopathology services as a component of the Afirma solution.
Federal and State Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions
We are subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar restrictions under the self-referral prohibitions of certain states in which we operate, including California's Physician Ownership and Referral Act, or PORA. Together these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payer for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician's immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition.
Both the Stark Law and PORA contain an exception for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician meeting certain contractual requirements. We have compensation arrangements with a number of physicians for personal services, such as speaking engagements and consulting activities. We have structured these arrangements with terms intended to comply with the requirements of the personal services exception to Stark and PORA.
However, we cannot be certain that regulators would find these arrangements to be in compliance with Stark, PORA or similar state laws. We would be required to refund any payments we receive pursuant to a referral prohibited by these laws to the patient, the payer or the Medicare program, as applicable.
Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:
•denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
•refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
•a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral;
•possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and
•a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law's prohibition.
These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required for a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
Further, a violation of PORA is a misdemeanor and could result in civil penalties and criminal fines. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by federal and California law. While we have attempted to comply with the Stark Law, PORA and similar laws of other states, it is possible that some of our financial arrangements with physicians could be subject to regulatory scrutiny at some point in the future, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review.
Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws
The federal Anti-kickback Law makes it a felony for a person or entity, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any federal health care program. A violation of the Anti-kickback Law may result in imprisonment for up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 in the case of individuals and $500,000 in the case of organizations. Convictions under the Anti-kickback Law result in mandatory exclusion from federal health care programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, HHS has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude health care providers and others engaged in prohibited activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Actions which violate the Anti-kickback Law also incur 
liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
Although the Anti-kickback Law applies only to federal health care programs, a number of states, including California, have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-kickback Law pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third- party payers. California's fee-splitting and Anti-kickback statute, Business and Professions Code Section 650, and its Medi-Cal Anti-kickback statute, Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14107.2, have been interpreted by the California Attorney General and California courts in substantially the same way as HHS and the courts have interpreted the Anti-kickback Law. A violation of Section 650 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $50,000. A violation of Section 14107.2 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $10,000.
Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between health care providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. The law enforcement authorities, the courts and Congress have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between health care providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-kickback Law, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases.
The federal Anti-kickback Law includes statutory exceptions and provides for a number of safe harbors. If an arrangement meets the provisions of a safe harbor, it is deemed not to violate the Anti-kickback Law. An arrangement must fully comply with each element of an applicable safe harbor in order to qualify for protection. Many state anti-kickback statutes have analogous exceptions or safe harbors to those of the federal Anti-kickback Law. These state anti-kickback statutes have generally been interpreted consistently with the Anti-kickback Law.
Among the safe harbors that may be relevant to us is the discount safe harbor. The discount safe harbor potentially applies to discounts provided by providers and suppliers, including laboratories, to physicians or institutions. If the terms of the discount safe harbor are met, the discounts will not be considered prohibited remuneration under the Anti-kickback Law. California does not have a discount safe harbor. However, as noted above, Section 650 has generally been interpreted consistent with the Anti-kickback Law.
The personal services safe harbor to the Anti-kickback Law provides that remuneration paid to a referral source for personal services will not violate the Anti-kickback Law provided all of the elements of that safe harbor are met. One element is that if the agreement is intended to provide for the services of the physician on a periodic, sporadic or part-time basis, rather than on a full-time basis for the term of the agreement, the agreement specifies exactly the schedule of such intervals, their precise length, and the exact charge for such intervals. Our personal services arrangements with some physicians may not meet the specific requirement of this safe harbor that the agreement specify exactly the schedule of the intervals of time to be spent on the services because the nature of the services, such as speaking engagements, does not lend itself to exact scheduling and therefore meeting this element of the personal services safe harbor is impractical. Failure to meet the terms of the safe harbor does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis under the language of the statute, taking into account all facts and circumstances.
While we believe that we are in compliance with the Anti-kickback Law, Section 650, and Section 14107.2, there can be no assurance that our relationships with physicians, academic institutions and other customers will not be subject to investigation or challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the Anti-kickback Law, Section 650, or Section 14107.2 could have a negative effect on our business.
Other Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other health care fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the federal health care programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms "usual charge" and "substantially in excess" are ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations, though the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General has provided some guidance on the topic.
Further, the federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment from or retaining an overpayment by the 
federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government's involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in up to treble damages, substantial civil penalties, fines, imprisonment or combination of the above, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs. California has an analogous state false claims act applicable to all payers, as do many other states; however, we may not be aware of all such rules and statutes and cannot provide assurance that we will be in compliance with all such laws and regulations.
In general, in recent years U.S. Attorneys’ Offices have increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry, as have Congress, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General and the Department of Defense. These bodies have all issued subpoenas and other requests for information to conduct investigations of, and commenced civil and criminal litigation against, healthcare companies based on financial arrangements with health care providers, regulatory compliance, product promotional practices and documentation, and coding and billing practices. Whistleblowers have filed numerous qui tam lawsuits against healthcare companies under the federal and state False Claims Acts in recent years, in part because the whistleblower can receive a portion of the government’s recovery under such suits.
In addition, in October 2018, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, or EKRA, was enacted as part of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (P.L 115-271). This law prohibits the solicitation, receipt, payment or offering of any remuneration in return for referring a patient or patronage to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory for services covered by both government and private payers. EKRA also applies to the payment or offering of remuneration in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. To date, neither the Department of Justice nor the Department of Health and Human Services has issued guidance further interpreting or implementing EKRA.
Finally, under PAMA, laboratories are required to report to CMS the private payer payment rates and test volumes paid by private payers based on final payments made during a specific “data collection period.” This data reporting requirement is triennial for most clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (annual for ADLTs), with the first data reporting period occurring in 2017 for final payments made in January through June 2016. The next data reporting period will be in 2021 for final payments made in January through June 2019. When reporting data under PAMA, the President, CEO, or CFO of a reporting entity, or an individual who has been delegated authority to sign for, and who reports directly to, such an officer, must sign the certification statement and be responsible for assuring that the data provided are accurate, complete, and truthful, and meets all the required reporting parameters. Failure to report or misrepresentation or omission in reporting can result in civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day for each violation and other penalties. We believe we are in compliance with the PAMA reporting requirements, but there can be no assurance that our reporting practices will not be scrutinized under the PAMA regulations.
International
Many countries in which we may offer any of our tests in the future have anti-kickback regulations prohibiting providers from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any national health care program. In situations involving physicians employed by state-funded institutions or national health care agencies, violation of the local anti-kickback law may also constitute a violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA.
The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual, business entity or employee of a U.S. business entity to offer or provide, directly or through a third party, including any potential distributors we may rely on in certain markets, anything of value to a foreign government official with corrupt intent to influence an award or continuation of business or to gain an unfair advantage, whether or not such conduct violates local laws. In addition, it is illegal for a company that reports to the SEC to have false or inaccurate books or records or to fail to maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We will also be required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors' activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
The standard of intent and knowledge in the Anti-Bribery cases is minimal-intent and knowledge are usually inferred from that fact that bribery took place. The accounting provisions do not require intent. Violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions for corporations and other business entities are subject to a fine of up to $2 million and officers, directors, 
stockholders, employees, and agents are subject to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Other countries, including the United Kingdom and other OECD Anti-Bribery Convention members, have similar anti-corruption regulations, such as the United Kingdom Anti-bribery Act.
When marketing our tests outside of the United States, we may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing, prohibitions on the import of tissue necessary for us to perform our tests or restrictions on the export of tissue imposed by countries outside of the United States or the import of tissue into the United States, and marketing approval. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may in some cases require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. To that end, we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contracts, such as confidentiality, invention assignment and licensing agreements. We also rely upon trade secret laws to protect unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation. In addition, we have what we consider to be reasonable security measures in place to maintain confidentiality. Our intellectual property strategy is intended to develop and maintain our competitive position.
We apply for and in-license patents covering our products and technologies and uses thereof, as we deem appropriate, however we may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we may fail to apply for patents in potentially relevant jurisdictions. Our issued patents expire between 2021 and 2038 and are related to methods used in the Afirma thyroid diagnostic platform, lung diagnostics, breast cancer diagnostics, and the nCounter Analysis System. 
We intend to file additional patent applications in the United States and abroad to strengthen our intellectual property rights; however, our patent applications (including the patent applications listed above) may not result in issued patents in a timely fashion or at all, and we cannot assure investors that any patents that have issued or might issue will protect our technology. We may receive notices of claims of potential infringement from third parties in the future.
We hold registered trademarks in the United States for "Veracyte," "Afirma," "Percepta," "Envisia," "Prosigna," "Know By Design," the Afirma logo, and the current and former Veracyte logos, and we have common law rights and pending trademark applications for "LymphMark" and “More About You.” We also hold registered trademarks in various jurisdictions outside of the United States.
We require all employees and technical consultants working for us to execute confidentiality agreements, which provide that all confidential information received by them during the course of the employment, consulting or business relationship be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with our research employees provide that all inventions, discoveries and other types of intellectual property, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, conceived by the individual while he or she is employed by us are assigned to us. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
Teams and Culture
Our People. At December 31, 2020, we had 320 employees, of which 59 work in laboratory operations, 35 in research and development and clinical development, 131 in selling and marketing, and 95 in general and administrative, including 55 in billing and client services, 13 in information technology and 13 in finance. None of our employees are the subject of collective bargaining arrangements, and our management considers its relationships with employees to be good.
Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. The Company believes in an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to inspire innovative ideas and decisions. In addition to being led by a female founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, our Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Medical Officer is also female and 58% of our employees are female, including 37% at the Vice President level and above, as of December 31, 2020. In addition, three of our nine Board of Directors are female, including our Chairman of the Board, as of December 31, 2020. Forty-eight percent (48%) of our employees are non-White, including 26% at the Vice President Level and above, as of December 31, 
2020. We strive to further advance diversity among our employees and believe that the resulting range of employee ideas, experiences and perspectives strengthens our company. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken important steps to protect the health and safety of our employees and the broader community. These have included asking employees who were able to work from home to do so in order to protect employees who perform mission-critical work in our facilities; reconfiguring our workspaces and workshift scheduling to enable social distancing; requiring face masks to be worn inside our offices; and other initiatives.
Environmental Matters
Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or new regulations will affect our business, operations or the cost of compliance.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We procure reagents, equipment, and other materials that we use to perform our tests from sole suppliers. We also purchase components used in our collection kits from sole-source suppliers. Some of these items are unique to these suppliers and vendors. In addition, we utilize a sole source to assemble and distribute our sample collection kits. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or the alternative sources will be available when we need them. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform the tests and for our collection kits, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications or are otherwise unusable, if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, if materials become unavailable due to COVID-19 related increases in demand for the materials, or if we elect to change suppliers, an interruption in test processing could occur, we may not be able to deliver patient reports and we may incur higher one-time switching costs. Any such interruption may significantly affect our future revenue, cause us to incur higher costs, and harm our customer relationships and reputation. In addition, in order to mitigate these risks, we maintain inventories of these supplies at higher levels than would be the case if multiple sources of supply were available. If our test volume decreases or we switch suppliers, we may hold excess inventory with expiration dates that occur before use which would adversely affect our losses and cash flow position. As we introduce any new test, we may experience supply issues as we ramp test volume.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be party to lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. We are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings.
