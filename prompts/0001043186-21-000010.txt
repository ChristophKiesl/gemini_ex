ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Our Company 
Stabilis Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”, “Stabilis”, “our”, “us” or “we”) are an energy transition company that provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation and fueling solutions including using liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and hydrogen to multiple end markets across North America. We have safely delivered over 250 million gallons of LNG through more than 25,000 truck deliveries during our 16-year operating history, which we believe makes us one of the largest and most experienced small-scale LNG providers in North America. We define “small-scale” LNG production to include liquefiers that produce less than 1,000,000 LNG gallons per day (3,788 cubic meters per day) and “small-scale” LNG distribution to include distribution by trailer or tank container (up to 15,000 LNG gallons) or marine vessels that carry less than 8,000,000 LNG gallons (approximately 30,000 cubic meters). We provide LNG and hydrogen solutions to customers in diverse end markets, including aerospace, agriculture, industrial, utility, pipeline, mining, energy, remote clean power, and high horsepower transportation markets. Our customers use LNG and hydrogen as a partner fuel for renewable energy, and as an alternative to traditional fuel sources, such as distillate fuel oil and propane, to reduce harmful environmental emissions and lower fuel costs. Our customers also use LNG as a “virtual pipeline” solution when natural gas pipelines are not available or are curtailed.
We also provide electrical and instrumentation construction, installation and service to the marine, power generation, oil and gas, and broad industrial market segments in Brazil. Our products are used to safely distribute and control the flow of electricity from a power generation source to mechanical devices utilizing the power. We also offer a range of electrical and instrumentation turnarounds, maintenance and renovation projects.
Additionally, we build power and control systems for the energy industry in China through our 40% interest in our Chinese joint venture, BOMAY Electric Industries, Inc (“BOMAY”).
Our Industry 
LNG can be used to deliver natural gas to locations where pipeline service is not available, has been interrupted, or needs to be supplemented. LNG can also be used to replace a variety of alternative fuels, including distillate fuel oil (including diesel fuel and other fuel oils) and propane, among others to provide both environmental and economic benefits. We believe that these alternative fuel markets are large and provide significant opportunities for LNG substitution.
In addition, hydrogen solutions will play an increasingly important role in the energy transition as hydrogen initiatives increase globally, including the development of hydrogen powered marine vessels, fueling station infrastructure and fuel cell technologies. 
We believe that LNG and hydrogen solutions provide an important balance between environmental sustainability, security and accessibility, and economic viability when compared to both renewables and other traditional hydrocarbon-based fuels and will play a key role in the energy transition.
BACKGROUND
On July 26, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), the Share Exchange with American Electric Technologies, Inc. (“American Electric”) and its subsidiaries was completed. In the Share Exchange, American Electric acquired directly 100% of the outstanding limited liability company membership interests of Stabilis Energy, LLC (“Stabilis LLC”) from LNG Investment Company, LLC (“LNG Investment”) and 20% of the outstanding limited liability membership interests of PEG Partners, LLC (“PEG”) from AEGIS NG LLC (“AEGIS”). AEGIS owned a 20% noncontrolling interest of PEG. The remaining 80% of the outstanding limited liability company interests of PEG were owned directly by Stabilis LLC. As a result, Stabilis LLC became a direct 100% owned subsidiary of American Electric and PEG became an indirectly-owned 100% subsidiary of American Electric. Under the Share Exchange Agreement, American Electric issued 13,178,750 post-split shares of common stock to acquire Stabilis LLC, which represented approximately 90% of the total amount of common stock of American Electric, which was issued and outstanding as of July 26, 2019. The proposed transaction was approved by the shareholders of American Electric at a Special Meeting of Stockholders. The Share Exchange resulted in a change of control of American Electric to control by Casey Crenshaw by virtue of his beneficial ownership of 88.4% of the common stock of American Electric to be outstanding as of July 26, 2019.
Immediately following the Effective Date, the Company declared a reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock at a ratio of one-for-eight, American Electric changed its name to Stabilis Energy, Inc., and our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “SLNG”. Our common stock traded under the symbol “SLNG” on the Nasdaq Stock Market from July 29, 2019 to October 2, 2019. On October 3, 2019 the Company’s common shares commenced trading on the OTCQX Best Market under the same symbol. Unless otherwise noted, any share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split. 
Because the former owners of Stabilis LLC owned 88.4% of the voting stock of the combined company immediately following the Effective Date, and certain other factors including that directors designated by LNG Investment constitute a majority of the post-closing board of directors, Stabilis LLC is treated as the acquiror of American Electric in the Share Exchange for accounting purposes. As a result, the Share Exchange is treated by American Electric as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). For further information regarding this transaction, see Note 2—Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
On August 5, 2019, we entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Chart Energy & Chemicals, Inc. (“Chart E&C”), Stabilis LLC, and Stabilis Eagle Ford, LLC (“Stabilis LNG EF”) for the satisfaction of indebtedness of Stabilis LNG EF to Chart E&C in the principal amount of $7 million (the “Exchanged Indebtedness”) in exchange for unregistered shares of our common stock (such transactions, the “Chart Transaction”). We issued to Chart E&C 1,470,807 shares of Company common stock, based on the per share price of Company common stock of 90% of the average of the dollar volume-weighted average prices per share of the common stock as calculated by Bloomberg for each of the five consecutive trading days ending on and including the third trading day immediately preceding the closing date, which took place on August 30, 2019. At closing, Stabilis LNG EF also paid to Chart E&C an amount in cash equal to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Exchanged Indebtedness due through the closing, plus a cash amount to be paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of our Common Stock. Management determined the modifications to be substantial and pursuant to ASC 470, the transaction was treated as a debt extinguishment for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million, which is included in Other Income in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.
On September 11, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange Agreement, which eliminated the right of Chart E&C to elect an additional exchange of all or any portion of the balance of the unpaid principal amount of the Note. The Exchange Agreement previously provided for Chart E&C to elect an additional exchange, on a second closing date, of all or any portion of the balance of the unpaid principal amount of the Note, for additional shares of our common stock based on the foregoing pricing calculation related to the closing date. For further information regarding this transaction, see Note 10—Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
On August 20, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Diversenergy, LLC (“Diversenergy”) and its subsidiaries, creating what we believe will be one of the leading LNG marketing and distribution companies in Mexico. Diversenergy specializes in LNG distribution, providing LNG to customers who use it as a fuel in mobile high horsepower applications and to customers who do not have natural gas pipeline access. We purchased all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Diversenergy for total consideration of 684,963 shares of Company common stock and $2.0 million in cash. The completion of the acquisition expanded the Company's presence in the distributed LNG and compressed natural gas (“CNG”) markets in Mexico. For further information regarding this transaction, see Note 2—Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
On August 20, 2019, we established Energía Superior Gas Natural LLC (“Energía Superior”) as a joint venture with CryoMex Investment Group LLC (“CryoMex”), to pursue investments in distributed natural gas production and distribution assets in Mexico (the “Joint Venture”). CryoMex is led by Grupo CLISA, a Monterrey, Mexico-based developer and operator of businesses in multiple end markets including energy.
The Joint Venture plans to invest in LNG and compressed natural gas production, transportation, storage, and regasification assets that serve multiple end markets throughout Mexico, including the industrial, mining, pipeline, utility, marine, and over-the-road transportation markets.
The market in which we operate has been impacted by the recent downturn in the energy market as well as the outbreak of COVID-19 and its progression into a pandemic in March 2020. Various containment measures, including large-scale travel bans, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns, have resulted in the slowing of economic growth and a reduced demand for oil and natural gas and the disruption of global manufacturing supply chains. As the COVID-19 environment evolves, governments, corporations and other authorities may continue to implement restrictions or policies that adversely impact consumer spending, the economy, commodity prices, demand for our products, and our business, operations and share price. The ultimate extent and long-term effects of the pandemic are difficult to determine, but a prolonged 
period of market fluctuations and weak general economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.
The Company implemented a number of cost control measures, including headcount reductions, temporary salary reductions, travel reductions, elimination of certain consultants, and other measures to adjust to anticipated activity levels and maintain adequate liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company will continue to monitor the developments relating to COVID-19, and will follow health and safety guidelines as they evolve. Management may implement further similar cost control measures, as necessary, but there can be no assurances that such measures will be effective.
At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company held on September 17, 2020, the stockholders of the Company authorized an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Stabilis Solutions, Inc. On October 9, 2020, Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation were filed by the Secretary of State of Florida and our common stock began trading under the name Stabilis Solutions, Inc. on October 19, 2020. The change of name did not result in changes to the Company’s ticker symbol, or the CUSIP number for the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, our common stock will continue to be traded on the OTCQX Best Market under the ticker symbol “SLNG”.
OUR BUSINESS
Summary 
Stabilis seeks to provide our customers with safe, reliable and cost-effective LNG and hydrogen fueling solutions and power delivery equipment and services. We believe that LNG and hydrogen solutions provide an important balance between environmental sustainability, security and accessibility, and economic viability when compared to both renewables and other traditional hydrocarbon-based fuels and will play a key role in the energy transition. We provide multiple products and services to our customers, including: 
LNG and Hydrogen Production and Sales—Stabilis builds and operates cryogenic natural gas processing facilities, called “liquefiers”, which convert natural gas into LNG through a multiple stage cooling process. We currently own and operate a liquefier that can produce up to 100,000 LNG gallons (379 cubic meters) per day. We also purchase LNG from third-party production sources which allows us to support customers in markets where we do not own liquefiers. Stabilis also has the capability to provide hydrogen from third-party hydrogen producers.
Transportation and Logistics Services—Stabilis offers our customers a “virtual natural gas pipeline” by providing them with turnkey LNG transportation and logistics services in North America. We deliver LNG to our customers’ work sites from both our own production facility and our network of approximately 25 third-party production sources located throughout North America. We own a fleet of LNG fueled trucks and cryogenic trailers to transport and deliver LNG. We also outsource similar equipment and transportation services for both LNG and hydrogen from qualified third-party providers as required to support our customer base.
Cryogenic Equipment Rental—Stabilis owns and operates a rental fleet of approximately 150 mobile LNG storage and vaporization assets, including: transportation trailers, electric and gas-fired vaporizers, ambient vaporizers, storage tanks, and mobile vehicle fuelers. We also own several stationary storage and regasification assets. We believe this is one of the largest fleets of small-scale LNG equipment in North America. Our fleet consists primarily of trailer-mounted mobile assets, making delivery to and between customer locations more efficient. We deploy these assets on job sites to provide our customers with the equipment required to transport, store, and consume LNG in their fueling operations.
Engineering and Field Support Services—Stabilis has experience in the safe, cost effective, and reliable use of LNG and hydrogen in multiple customer applications. We have also developed many processes and procedures that we believe improve our customers’ use of LNG and hydrogen in their operations. Our engineers help our customers design and integrate LNG and hydrogen into their fueling operations and our field service technicians help our customers mobilize, commission and reliably operate on the job site.
Stabilis generates revenue by selling and delivering LNG and hydrogen to our customers. We also generate revenue by renting cryogenic equipment and providing engineering and field support services. We sell our products and services separately or as a bundle depending on the customer’s needs. LNG pricing depends on market pricing for natural gas and competing fuel sources (such as diesel, fuel oil, and propane among others), as well as the customer’s purchased volume, contract duration and credit profile. 
Stabilis’ customers use LNG and hydrogen in their operations for multiple reasons, including lower and more stable fuel costs, reduced environmental emissions, and improved operating performance. We serve customers in a variety of end markets, including aerospace, industrial, energy, mining, remote clean power, utilities and pipelines, and high horsepower transportation. We believe that LNG and hydrogen consumption will continue to increase in these end markets in the future. 
Stabilis believes that our extensive operating experience positions us to be a leader in the North American small-scale LNG and hydrogen markets. We operate an LNG liquefier and have executed over 200 turnkey LNG solutions projects for our customers. We plan to leverage this experience to grow our business by investing in new LNG production and both LNG and hydrogen distribution assets throughout North America.
Power Delivery Solutions—Stabilis provides power delivery equipment and services for the marine, power generation, oil and gas, and broad industrial market segments in Brazil. Our products are used to safely distribute and control the flow of electricity from a power generation source to mechanical devices utilizing the power. We also offer a range of electrical and instrumentation turnarounds, maintenance and renovation projects.
Additionally, we build power and control systems for the energy industry in China through our 40% interest in BOMAY.
Market for Small-Scale LNG and Hydrogen in North America 
LNG can serve as a partner fuel for renewable energy sources and provides an important balance between environmental sustainability, security and access, and economic viability as a source of fuel. LNG can also be used to deliver natural gas to locations where pipeline service is not available, has been interrupted, or needs to be supplemented and to replace a variety of alternative fuels, including distillate fuel oil (including diesel fuel and other fuel oils) and propane, among others. We believe that these alternative fuel markets are large and provide significant opportunities for LNG substitution. U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) data for the U.S. market size for these alternative fuels in 2018 was as follows: 

 | | | | ADI Estimated LNG Market Size (LNG Gallons)
 | EIAReportedGallons(Billions) | CubicMeters(Millions) | LNG GallonEquivalent(Billions) | 2018(Billions) | % 2018Combined | 2030(Billions) | % 2030Combined

Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration and ADI Analytics 
According to ADI Analytics ("ADI"), the North American small-scale LNG market was 499 million gallons in 2019 and is projected to be 1.9 billion gallons by 2030. This implies that LNG comprised approximately 0.4% of the combined U.S. distillate and propane markets in 2019 and will comprise approximately 1.6% of the current combined market size by 2030. We believe that LNG is a suitable substitute for most diesel and propane applications and that the LNG market share growth projected in the table above should be achievable based on current market trends. The market for hydrogen in the applications we serve is nascent but expected to grow rapidly.
We believe that the following factors could drive significant LNG and hydrogen market growth in North America over the next decade:
Lower Emissions than Alternative Fossil Fuels. Natural gas contains less carbon than most other fossil fuels and, as a result, produces fewer carbon dioxide emissions when burned. The National Energy Technology Laboratory indicates that new natural gas power plants emit between 50% and 60% less carbon dioxide compared with emissions from a typical coal plant. The Argonne National Laboratory indicates that natural gas vehicles produce between 13% and 21% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than comparable gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles. Additional studies indicate that natural gas also produces lower particulate matter and sulfur emissions than other fossil fuels. We believe the relative environmental benefits of natural gas as a fuel is becoming increasingly important as our customers expand their corporate sustainability mandates to lower greenhouse gas 
emissions and increase decarbonization initiatives. Hydrogen produces no harmful environmental emissions when utilized in similar applications.
Increasing Growth in Renewable Energy Production. Energy production from renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar, is growing rapidly across the world as many governments and businesses seek to reduce their carbon emissions. For example, The International Renewable Energy Agency (“IRENA”) reports that U.S. installed electricity capacity based on renewable energy increased 7.3% in 2019 with solar and wind accounting for all of the growth. IRENA projects similar growth trends for the renewable energy production over the next several years. However, wind and solar are intermittent energy sources that require back-up energy sources that can come into service quickly and reliably. We believe that natural gas driven turbines and engines are the preferred viable back-up power source as they meet these operating requirements and use relatively clean natural gas fuel. We believe that natural gas power generation could support the growth of wind and solar energy production and that LNG could be a preferred source of natural gas fuel for off-pipeline applications. Hydrogen powered applications for renewable energy support are also in development.
Less Expensive than Alternative Fuels. Technological advances in natural gas production have unlocked significant new gas reserves in North America. We believe that these proven, abundant and growing reserves of natural gas have the potential to produce among the highest volumes of natural gas in the world. This abundant supply of natural gas has supported relatively low natural gas prices in North America. The cost of natural gas in the United States and Canada currently is less than the cost of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis. In addition, because the price of the natural gas commodity makes up a smaller portion of the total cost of LNG relative to the commodity portion of competing fuels, the price of LNG is less sensitive to variations in the underlying commodity cost. These factors have made LNG more economical than competing fuel sources, and we believe that LNG will maintain this cost advantage into the foreseeable future. The market for hydrogen is developing but at this time we do not believe it is cost competitive with many traditional hydrocarbon-based fuel sources.

The following chart sets forth the wholesale price of Propane, Ultra-Low No. 2 Diesel, Indicative Liquefied Natural Gas and Natural Gas (Henry Hub).

Better Safety than Alternative Fuels. The physical characteristics of LNG make it a safer fuel when compared to diesel and propane because it boils and dissipates rapidly into the air when spilled instead of pooling on or near the ground. If released, LNG is also less combustible than diesel and propane because it ignites at relatively high temperatures and within a narrow flammability range when mixed with air. In addition, LNG fuel tanks and systems used in natural gas applications are subjected to a number of federal and state required safety tests, such as fire, environmental hazard, burst pressure and crash testing that ensure their safety. Processes and procedures for using hydrogen in similar applications are under development.
Established LNG Production and Distribution Technology. ADI reports that small-scale LNG production and distribution technologies have been proven and are now widely available from multiple vendors. Small-scale liquefiers are available in modular formats from several vendors and many of them have established track records of reliable and safe operating performance. LNG transport trailers, storage vessels, and vaporization equipment are also available from multiple vendors, and most of this equipment also comes with an established operating track record. We believe that the availability of proven small-scale LNG production and distribution technologies reduces the technology risk in growing the industry, but it also places a premium on the owner’s or operator’s construction and operating capabilities. Hydrogen production and distribution technologies are currently under development by various manufacturers.
The market for Hydrogen is nascent and is expected to grow rapidly as a key energy transition fuel in the coming decades. According to a 2021 study published by the Hydrogen Council, over 200 hydrogen projects have been announced worldwide, including over 19 in North America, including projects for large-scale industrial usage, use as a transportation fuel in ships and buses, and distribution, transportation, and storage infrastructure. Hydrogen spending projections across the value chain based on project announcements add up to more than $300 billion through 2030. Hydrogen can be transported by trucks, pipelines or ships depending on the targeted end-use. We expect that small-scale hydrogen distribution using equipment and expertise similar to that used for small-scale LNG will play an important role in the ultimate acceptance and utilization of hydrogen as a low to zero emission fuel source.
Our Products, Services and Other Business Activities 
Stabilis’ principal products, services and business activities are described below. Financial information about the revenue we receive from these activities is discussed in this report in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
LNG Production. Stabilis owns and operates an LNG liquefier near George West, Texas, which we refer to as the “George West Liquefier”, that has the capacity to produce 36.5 million LNG gallons (138,258 cubic meters) per year or 100,000 LNG gallons (379 cubic meters) per day. This plant includes a dual truck trailer loading system and a 270,000 LNG gallon (1,023 cubic meters) storage tank system. The George West Liquefier was 99.2% dispatchable in 2020 with the only shutdowns coming for routine scheduled maintenance. We intend to build or acquire additional liquefiers throughout North America over the next several years as we seek to optimize our North American LNG supply network. 
We are also in the process of evaluating other opportunities to develop liquefiers throughout North America, including several locations in Mexico. 
LNG and Hydrogen Sales. Stabilis supplies our customers with LNG produced at our own liquefaction facility as well as LNG and hydrogen produced at third-party facilities. We make the determination of LNG and hydrogen supply sources based on product cost, the transportation cost to deliver to regional customer locations, and the reliability of the supply source. Our network of 25 third-party LNG production facilities located throughout North America includes: 1) utility owned peak shaving plants, 2) natural gas/helium processing facilities, and 3) other merchant LNG production facilities similar to our George West Liquefier. We have contracts with these production sources that allow us to purchase LNG for our customers as required and without firm or long-term volume commitments. We can also purchase hydrogen from sources across the country. We believe that our third-party supply network is the largest and most complete in North America allowing us access to approximately 500 million LNG gallons (1.9 million cubic meters) of capacity annually on an as required basis. Occasionally the LNG or hydrogen we obtain from third parties may be purchased under take-or-pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes. In situations where firm take or pay contracts are required, we try to support them with back-to-back customer purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2020, we do not have take-or-pay LNG or hydrogen supply contracts matched to contracted customer demand. As of December 31, 2019, we had one firm take-or-pay LNG supply contract. In 2020, we purchased approximately 43% of our LNG from third-party suppliers and we produced the remainder at the George West Liquefier. 
Stabilis sells LNG and hydrogen on a bulk or wholesale basis to our customers. We sell LNG through supply contracts that are priced on a regional commodity index-plus basis, such that LNG sales under these contracts increase or decrease as a result of changes in the commodity cost of natural gas. We sell LNG to our customers based on the same commodity index we buy natural gas to reduce our exposure to commodity prices changes. We sell LNG fuel at prices we set based on prevailing market conditions. Our pricing methodology depends on our cost of natural gas and LNG production, the customer’s commercial requirements, the price of competing energy sources, volumes required, contract duration, and the customer’s credit profile. 
Transportation and Logistics Services. Stabilis offers its customers a “virtual natural gas pipeline” by providing them with turnkey transportation and logistics services for delivery from the LNG production source to the LNG consumption site. Our logistics and scheduling team offers 24-hour support to our customers. We utilize customized telemetry and fuel dispatch software systems to optimize our LNG deliveries. Customers can call our logistics team and have LNG delivered quickly and efficiently to almost any location in North America. We deliver LNG to our customers’ sites with our fleet of 41 tanker trailers, where it is stored and then vaporized on demand to fuel our customers consuming equipment which includes engines, turbines, generators, furnaces, dryers, boilers, kilns, pipelines, and other high horsepower applications. We offer similar turn-key solutions for hydrogen customers utilizing the same transportation and logistics capabilities.
Stabilis owns a fleet of LNG fueled trucks that are used to make deliveries to our customers near the George West Liquefier. We also have contracts with multiple national and regional trucking companies to deliver LNG to our customers. These carriers are certified to transport hazardous materials and the drivers are trained on safe LNG operating and delivery procedures. We believe that our established relationships with these carriers gives us a unique ability to reliably and safely deliver LNG to almost any location in North America on short notice. 
Cryogenic Equipment Rental. Stabilis believes that we own the largest small-scale rental fleet of mobile LNG storage, transportation and vaporization equipment in North America. Our asset base includes 150 pieces of equipment, including: transportation trailers, electric and gas-fired vaporizers, ambient vaporizers, storage tanks, and mobile vehicle fuelers. We use these assets to provide customers with the necessary equipment to transport, store, and consume LNG in their operations. 
Stabilis rents our cryogenic and related equipment to customers based on day rates that vary by the cost and availability of our equipment, and align with our customers’ contract terms. Our equipment is designed specifically for use in small-scale LNG applications and includes the safety and operational features that our customers and our regulators require. We believe that our current fleet of equipment can support significant growth in volumes in our business. We continually evaluate adding additional equipment as required by our customers to optimize their operations.

Engineering and Field Service Support Services. Stabilis believes it has significant experience in the safe, cost efficient and reliable use of LNG and hydrogen in multiple customer applications. Our engineering team provides our customers with safe and effective fueling plans. Our engineering services are usually included in our efforts to sell and commission customer projects, however sometimes we bill customers for them on an hourly or fixed project basis. Our staff of approximately 20 trained field service technicians help our customers use LNG and hydrogen safely and efficiently on their job sites. We generally bill our customers for field service technicians on a day rate basis but sometimes this cost is included in bundled pricing. 
Power Delivery Solutions. As a result of the business combination with American Electric, Stabilis provides power delivery equipment and services for the oil and gas, marine vessel, power generation and broad industrial market segments in Brazil, and build electrical systems for sale in China through our 40% interest in BOMAY. We generally bill customers based on contractual terms that can be based on an event or an hourly rate. The resale of electrical and instrumentation equipment is billed upon delivery.
Our Customers 
Stabilis serves customers in a variety of end markets, including aerospace, industrial, utilities and pipelines, mining, energy, commercial, and transportation within the United States and Mexico. We believe these customer markets are well suited to use LNG and hydrogen because they consume relatively high volumes of fuel, operate in mobile, temporary or off-pipeline locations, have limited access to alternative fuel sources, and/or are facing increasingly stringent emissions or other environmental requirements. We currently serve approximately 160 customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Noble Energy, Inc. and Aggreko Plc each accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Noble Energy, Inc. accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. During such periods, no other purchaser accounted for 10% or more of our revenue. We believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations because LNG is a fungible product with well-established markets and numerous purchasers. 
Aerospace. The Aerospace industry utilizes LNG as a propellent for rocket propulsion systems and LNG provides an economical, readily available, and easily stored fuel for rockets engines. Aerospace firms may also utilize LNG for power generation at remote facilities. Consumption of LNG at aerospace facilities vary significantly by project type.
Industrial. Industrial applications for LNG include sand and aggregate producers, asphalt plants, greenhouses, food processers, paper mills, agricultural dryers, and general manufacturing facilities. Remote sand producers and mobile asphalt plants that use LNG to produce heat for their processing and drying operation are among our largest customers. LNG often replaces propane, fuel oil, or diesel fuel in these applications. These customers often cannot justify the cost of new pipeline infrastructure and using LNG requires minimal up-front costs, regulatory approvals, and lead time requirements. We believe LNG is optimal for these applications because it is cost-effective with stable pricing, offers consistent supply without curtailments, provides an energy density that minimizes storage requirements, and has a clean and consistent burn that makes heating operations more predictable. Based on our experience, sand production facilities can consume 10,000 to 20,000 LNG gallons per day, and asphalt plants can use 5,000 to 10,000 LNG gallons per day. 
Utilities and Pipelines. North America has an expansive network of pipelines that, based on age and increasingly more stringent regulations, require routine testing and maintenance. During such events LNG fueling solutions can provide flow assurance to address natural gas supply interruptions during pipeline hydrostatic testing, repairs, gas distribution system 
curtailments, or unplanned outages. Such solutions can also provide a bridge for large industrial or utility customers before permanent pipelines are installed. LNG is becoming more predominant in regions where natural gas demand is growing and utilities and pipelines are required to continue to meet critical peak gas demand. LNG can provide an economic solution to support these supply requirements during peak weather conditions, gas curtailments and/or pipeline repairs. In addition, utilities and other power providers can also utilizes LNG to provide clean distributed power when access to an electrical grid is limited, additional power is needed during times of peak load, or power infrastructure is damaged due to storms such as hurricanes or wildfires. LNG usage in utility and pipeline applications varies significantly by project type. Hydrogen and methane blends are currently being tested by pipelines as a method of reducing emissions from pipeline gas. 
Mining. Mines, including those producing metals, rare earth materials, and coal, are often located in remote locations that are off the electrical grid and do not have natural gas pipeline access. Mines use LNG to fuel electrical generators and to produce heat for their processing activities. Several mines have also tested using LNG as a fuel for their mine trucks and other high horsepower engine equipment. In addition to fuel cost benefits, LNG can help reduce emissions at mines that are often located in environmentally sensitive areas. Based on our experience, power generation and heating applications at mines can consume 10,000 to 100,000 LNG gallons per day. 
Energy. Energy producers use high horsepower engines to power their drilling and pressure pumping operations. LNG displaces some of the total diesel fuel consumption in these applications using dual-fuel engine technology. We believe that energy producers can use LNG to reduce fuel costs and to meet environmental emissions requirements. Based on our experience, dual-fuel drill rigs can consume 1,000 to 5,000 LNG gallons per day and dual-fuel pressure pumping spreads can consume 10,000 to 20,000 LNG gallons per day. Energy producers use the field gas being produced in their operations to fuel the turbine engines that power their pressure pumping spreads. While turbines can burn field gas, they often require significant amounts of LNG for primary or back-up fuel supply because field gas often varies widely in volume, composition, and pressure. Based on our experience, turbine driven pressure pumping operations can consume 30,000 to 60,000 LNG gallons per day when using LNG as the primary fuel. 
Commercial. Commercial locations, including offices, call centers, data centers and, campuses, often need fuel for primary or back-up power generation. LNG often replaces propane or diesel fuel in these applications. LNG usage in commercial applications varies significantly by location size and purpose. 
Transportation. LNG is being used to fuel high horsepower engines in multiple transportation applications, including over-the-road trucking, mine haul trucks, locomotives, and marine engines, due to reduced emissions and cost savings benefits. Extensive LNG fueling networks exist currently in the United States, the European Union, and China. Regulatory requirements are accelerating the adoption of LNG as a transportation fuel in other markets, particularly in the marine sector. The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) has imposed a global sulfur cap of 0.5% on ships trading outside of established emission control areas starting in January 2020, a level that could be difficult to achieve using common marine fuels, such as heavy fuel oil, but could be achieved using LNG. Large marine vessels can take several hundred thousand gallons of LNG in a single fuel bunkering event. LNG is also utilized as a fuel for rail locomotives and mining trucks. LNG usage in transportation application varies by the horsepower requirements of the application. Hydrogen is currently being tested as an alternative fuel for cars, trucks, trains, and marine vessels.
Mexico. The volume of U.S. produced natural gas going to Mexico has been increasing significantly over the last several years as pipelines have been built to deliver natural gas to major Mexican cities and utility sites. However, a large portion of Mexico does not have access to these pipelines and is not expected to have access in the near-term so LNG can be used to provide energy to these areas. We believe we are currently one of the largest small-scale LNG exporters to Mexico with multiple truckloads crossing the border from our George West Liquefier daily. Primary end markets for LNG in Mexico include the industrial, mining, and commercial sectors. We believe that the demand for LNG will continue to grow as the population and economy grow. 
We actively deliver LNG through virtual distribution systems, providing LNG to customers who use it as a fuel in mobile high horsepower applications and to customers who do not have natural gas pipeline access. 
Brazil. We offer a range of electrical and instrumentation construction and installation services to our customers. These services include new construction as well as electrical and instrumentation turnarounds, maintenance and renovation projects. 
China. Through our 40% interest in BOMAY, we provide power and control systems for the land drilling market in China.
Competitive Strengths 
Stabilis believes that we are well positioned to execute our business strategies based on the following competitive strengths: 
LNG is an economically and environmentally attractive product. Stabilis believes that many of our customers use LNG because it can significantly reduce harmful carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur, particulate matter, and other emissions as compared to other hydrocarbon-based fuels. LNG is also an important partner fuel for renewables such as solar and wind power and will be a key component of the energy transition to more sustainable sources of energy. We also believe that the combination of cost benefits and environmental benefits makes LNG a compelling fuel source for many energy consumers. We believe that LNG can be delivered to customers at prices that are lower and more stable than what they would pay for distillate fuels or propane. In addition, several of our customers have reported that LNG as a fuel decreases their operating costs by reducing equipment maintenance requirements and providing more consistent burn characteristics.
Demonstrated ability to execute LNG and hydrogen projects safely and cost effectively. Stabilis has produced and delivered over 250 million gallons of LNG to our customers throughout our 15+ year operating history. Our experience includes building and operating LNG production facilities, delivering LNG from third-party sources to our customers, and designing and executing a wide-variety of turnkey LNG fueling solutions for our customers using our cryogenic equipment fleet supported by our field service team. We have experience serving customers in multiple end markets including aerospace, industrial, utilities and pipelines, mining, energy, remote clean power, and transportation. We also have experience exporting LNG to Mexico and Canada. Finally, we believe our team is among the most experienced in the small-scale LNG industry. We believe that we can leverage this proven LNG execution experience to grow our business in existing markets and expand our business into new markets including the nascent hydrogen market. The production and distribution of hydrogen shares many attributes with LNG and we believe hydrogen will be a safe fuel and increasingly cost effective as acceptance grows.
Comprehensive provider of “virtual natural gas pipeline” solutions throughout North America. Stabilis offers our customers a comprehensive off-pipeline natural gas solution by providing the supply infrastructure, transportation and logistics, and field service support necessary to deliver LNG to them in a program that is tailored to their consumption needs. We believe we own one of the largest fleets of cryogenic transportation, storage, and vaporization equipment in North America. We can provide our customers LNG and related services for a wide variety of applications almost anywhere in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We believe that our ability to be a “one stop shop” for all of our customers’ off-pipeline natural gas requirements throughout North America is unique among LNG providers. We believe our LNG experience allows us to expand our comprehensive offerings using hydrogen.
Ability to leverage existing LNG production and delivery capabilities into new markets. Stabilis believes that our experience producing and distributing LNG can be leveraged to grow into new geographic and service end markets. Since our founding we have expanded our service area across the United States, northern Mexico, and western Canada. We have also expanded our industry coverage to include multiple new end markets and customers. We accomplished this expansion into new markets by leveraging our LNG production and distribution expertise, in combination with our cryogenic engineering and project development capabilities, to meet new customer needs. 
Growth Strategy 
Stabilis’ primary business objective is to provide superior returns to our shareholders by becoming the leading vertically integrated small-scale LNG solution provider in the Americas. We intend to accomplish this objective by implementing the following growth strategies: 
Expand our LNG production business throughout North America. Stabilis believes that the customers and markets we serve could benefit from localized LNG supply sourcing. To this end, we believe that expanding our LNG liquefaction footprint throughout North America will enhance our competitive position by lowering our delivered cost and by creating a comprehensive and reliable supply network for our customers. We intend to leverage our liquefier development, construction, and operations experience to develop new liquefiers in markets that require LNG supply. We plan to both build new liquefiers and acquire existing liquefiers based on whichever offers the best service to our customers and returns to our investors. 
Expand our LNG distribution business throughout North America. Stabilis believes that expanding our LNG distribution capabilities throughout North America will enhance our competitive position by creating a comprehensive and reliable supply network for our customers, lowering our delivered LNG costs, and expanding our ability to service new industries and geographies. We currently provide LNG distribution and field service support throughout the United States and parts of Mexico and Canada. We plan to expand our distribution capabilities by adding equipment to our fleet, including the high-flow, high pressure vaporization equipment required by pipelines and turbine powered pressure pumping spreads. In addition, we plan to explore opportunities that expand our geographic reach and industry expertise, including acquisitions of companies that already 
service our targeted customers. Finally, we plan to explore opportunities to expand into the compressed natural gas (“CNG”) and hydrogen markets to provide comprehensive energy transition solutions to our customers. 
Consistent with our strategy to expand our LNG production business, Stabilis will focus the expansion of our LNG distribution business in the United States and Mexico. We believe that supporting our liquefiers with our distribution capabilities optimizes our asset base and our ability to service our customers. We also plan to expand our third-party LNG supply network in these markets so we can provide our customers with comprehensive and reliable service. 

Use our LNG production and distribution expertise to expand into Latin and South America. Stabilis believes there is a significant opportunity to leverage our expertise in LNG production and distribution to expand our business into power generation opportunities in Latin and South America. Our business development team is identifying utilities and industrial energy consumers that may view LNG as a compelling alternative to traditional distillate fuels. We believe it will be compelling for them to enter into long-term contracts that support the development of the infrastructure required to deliver LNG directly to their power generation and other assets. We expect that these markets will require some combination of LNG production or sourcing, local logistics, distribution services and field support, paired with Stabilis-owned power generation assets in some instances. 
Expand our ability to deliver Hydrogen to our customers. Stabilis believes that the market opportunity for zero emissions hydrogen fuel is growing. We are engaged with customers to use hydrogen and hydrogen/methane blends (“Hythane”) in applications including marine power generation, distributed power generation, and pipelines. We will continue to build our technical and operating expertise to bring safe and reliable hydrogen fueling solutions to our customers. We will also seek to add hydrogen capable production, transportation, and distribution assets to our equipment fleet to support our customers.
Maintain financial strength and flexibility. Stabilis will seek to maintain a conservative balance sheet which we believe will allow us to better react to market opportunities. We believe that maintaining adequate balance sheet flexibility, along with positive cash flows from operations, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute on our business strategies. 
Competition 
The market for natural gas is highly competitive. Stabilis believes the biggest competition for LNG in these applications are distillate fuels and propane as they power the majority of engines and generators in our target markets. We also compete with other fuel sources including pipeline natural gas and CNG. We believe we have multiple competitors in the market for natural gas fuel, including, but not limited to: 
•Producers and distributors of LNG, including New Fortress Energy LLC, Clean Energy Fuels Corp., Pivotal LNG Inc.(Dominion Energy), Eagle LNG, Applied LNG, Kinetrex Energy, Sapphire Gas Solutions, numerous utilities located across the country which produce LNG for peak shaving purposes, and numerous local providers of cryogenic distribution and field services; and 
•Producers and distributors of CNG, including NG Advantage LLC, Xpress Natural Gas LLC, Compass Natural Gas Partners LP and Certarus Ltd. 
Stabilis competes with other natural gas companies, as well as other fossil fuel sources, based on a variety of factors, including, among others, cost, supply, availability, quality, emissions, and safety of the fuel. Location is often a primary competitive factor as transportation costs limit the distance LNG can be hauled at competitive prices. We believe we compare favorably with many of our competitors on the basis of these factors; however, some of our competitors have longer operating histories and market-based experience, larger customer bases, more expansive brand recognition, deeper market penetration and substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than our business. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences, legal requirements or other industry or regulatory trends, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, dedicate more effort to infrastructure and systems development in support of their business or product development activities and exert more influence on the regulatory landscape that impacts the natural gas fuel market. Additionally, utilities and their affiliates typically have unique competitive advantages, including a lower cost of capital, substantial and predictable cash flows, long-standing customer relationships, greater brand awareness, and large sales and marketing organizations. 
Stabilis does not believe that we compete with mid-scale and world-scale LNG liquefiers that produce more than 1,000,000 LNG-gallons (3,788 cubic meters) per day. These large LNG production facilities, such as those operated by Cheniere Energy and Freeport LNG, typically are designed and permitted to fill large marine vessels that deliver cargos of 21,120,000 LNG-gallons (80,000 cubic meters) or more to large import terminals in foreign markets. We do not believe that any of them currently have or plan to have truck loading facilities that would be required to supply LNG to small-scale LNG customers. We also do not believe 
that any mid-scale or large-scale liquefiers currently have plans to install LNG loading capabilities for vessels smaller than 7,920,000 LNG-gallons (30,000 cubic meters). 
Sales and Marketing 
Stabilis markets our products and services primarily through our direct sales force, which includes sales representatives covering all of our major geographic and customer markets, as well as attendance at trade shows and participation in industry conferences and events. Our technical, sales and marketing teams also work closely with federal, state and local government agencies to provide education about the value of natural gas as a fuel and to keep abreast of proposed and newly adopted regulations that affect our industry. 
Seasonality 
A portion of Stabilis’ operating revenues and profits relate to providing backup gas for the local distribution infrastructure in the United States and Mexico to support utilities during times of peak heating demand from November through March. Revenues are generally lower from April to October during the months when heating demand is seasonally lower. 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 
Stabilis is subject to a variety of federal, international, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, zoning and land use, public reporting and taxation, among others. Any changes to existing laws or regulations, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or failure by us to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in significant additional expense to us or our customers or a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Regulations that significantly affect our operating activities are described below. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date, but new laws or regulations or amendments to existing laws or regulations to make them more stringent could have such an effect in the future. We cannot estimate the costs that may be required for us to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, and these unknown costs are not contemplated by our existing customer agreements or our budgets and cost estimates. We believe that we are in compliance with all environmental and other governmental regulations. Our compliance has, to date, had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Construction and Operation of LNG Liquefaction Plants. To build and operate LNG liquefaction plants, Stabilis must apply for facility permits or licenses that address many factors, including storm water and wastewater discharges, waste handling, and air emissions related to production activities and equipment operation. The construction of LNG plants must also be approved by local planning boards and fire departments. 
Transportation of LNG. Federal and state safety standards require that LNG is moved by qualified drivers in cryogenic containers designed for LNG transportation. Drivers are subject to U.S. Department of Transportation (“USDOT”) regulations, such as Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), Hazardous Materials Regulations, and state certification requirements, such as certifications by the Alternative Energy Division of the Railroad Commission of Texas. Cryogenic containers have to undergo annual USDOT visual inspections and periodic pressure tests. Motor vehicles equipped with an LNG container or other motor vehicles used principally for transporting LNG in portable containers in Texas have to be registered with the Railroad Commission of Texas. 
Transfer of LNG. Federal safety standards require each transfer of LNG to be conducted in accordance with specific written safety procedures. These procedures must require that qualified personnel be in attendance during all LNG transfer operations, and these procedures must be implemented, and copies of the procedures must be available/displayed, at each LNG transfer location. 
Storage and Vaporization of LNG at Customer Sites. To install and operate both temporary and permanent storage and vaporization equipment, Stabilis may apply for permits or licenses that address many factors, including waste handling and air emissions related to onsite storage and equipment operation or consult with customers so they may apply for needed permits. The operation and siting of storage and vaporization of LNG may also require approval by local planning boards and fire departments. 
Import & Export of LNG. To import or export LNG from the United States to Mexico and Canada via truck, numerous authorizations are required. In support of our business in Canada, Stabilis maintains an import and export license from the United States Department of Energy (“DOE”) and from the National Energy Board of Canada (“NEB”). We maintain an Emergency Response Action Plan (“ERAP”) with Transport Canada. In support of our business in Mexico, we maintain an export license 
from the DOE and maintain import permits to bring the LNG into the country. Exporting LNG in large quantities would require additional permits and licenses from various regulatory agencies, including the DOE and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). We do not have these permits at this time but could file for such authorizations in the future. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2020, Stabilis had 268 employees, 220 of whom were full-time employees. We believe our relations with employees are satisfactory. None of our employees are currently subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 
Intellectual Property 
The intellectual property portfolio of Stabilis and its subsidiaries includes patents and trademarks. The Company has two pending patent applications in the United States, specifically a non-provisional patent application for the use of natural gas for well-enhancement and a non-provisional patent application for natural gas deliquification. The Company has four pending foreign patent applications (two in Canada and two in Mexico). Additionally, the Company owns or has exclusive license to five U.S. and one foreign (Mexico) patents. The last patent to expire in the U.S. will expire in January 2031, absent any adjustments or extensions. The Company has ten U.S. trademark registrations and one foreign trademark registration (Canada). The Company has no pending trademark applications.
