Item 1. Business
Corporate History and Background
We are a former blank check company incorporated on September 27, 2019 under the name CF Finance Acquisition Corp. II (“CF II”) as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On March 8, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), CF II consummated the previously announced merger pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 30, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among CF II, PVMS Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned-subsidiary of CF II (“Merger Sub”), and View, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Legacy View”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, a business combination between CF II and Legacy View was affected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Legacy View (the “Business Combination”), with Legacy View surviving as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CF II (the “Merger” and collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). On the Closing Date, CF II changed its name from CF Finance Acquisition Corp. II to View, Inc. and Legacy View changed its name to View Operating Corporation. Our Class A Common Stock and Public Warrants are listed on the Nasdaq under the symbols “VIEW” and “VIEWW”, respectively.
Overview
View, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“View” or the “Company”), headquartered in Milpitas, California, is a leading smart buildings platform and technology company that transforms buildings to improve human health and experience, reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, and generate additional revenue for building owners. 
Our innovative products are designed to enable people to lead healthier and more productive lives by increasing access to daylight and views, while minimizing associated glare and heat from the sun and keeping occupants comfortable. These products also simultaneously reduce energy consumption from lighting and HVAC, thus reducing carbon emissions. To achieve these benefits, we design, manufacture, and provide electrochromic or smart glass panels to which we add a 1 micrometer (~1/100th the thickness of human hair) proprietary electrochromic coating. These smart glass panels, in combination with our proprietary network infrastructure, software and algorithms, intelligently adjust in response to the sun by tinting from clear to dark states, and vice versa, to minimize heat and glare without ever blocking the view. In addition, we offer a suite of fully integrated, cloud-connected smart-building products that are designed to enable us to further optimize the human experience within buildings, improve cybersecurity, further reduce energy usage and carbon footprint, reduce real estate operating costs, provide real estate owners greater visibility into and control over the utilization of their assets, and provide a platform on which to integrate and deploy new technologies into buildings.
View's earlier generation products are described best as “smart glass,” which are primarily composed of three components that all work together to produce a solution:
•the insulating glass unit; which is either double or triple pane with a micrometer semiconductor (or electrochromic) coating.
•the network infrastructure; which is composed of the controllers, connectors, sensors, and cabling.
•the software: which includes the predictive algorithms, artificial intelligence, remote management tools, and user-facing iOS and Android apps, to control the tint of the glass.
After the Company completed installations in a few hundred buildings, it identified an opportunity to use its network infrastructure and cabling as the backbone on which different smart and connected devices in a typical building could operate. We believe customers using View Smart Glass can leverage View’s network as their building’s operations technology infrastructure to reduce duplicative labor costs, reduce materials usage, provide better cyber security, improve visibility and management of connected devices, and future-proof the building through easy upgradability.
Recognizing the opportunity to significantly improve the human experience, energy performance and carbon footprint in buildings, and real estate operating costs through adoption of technology, View began selling a Smart Building Platform, which is a fully integrated smart window platform, to building owners starting in 2021. Concurrent with the commencement of the sales efforts, View also began hiring an extensive team of construction managers, project managers, and building specialists to 
enable the Company to work towards delivering the fully installed and integrated Smart Building Platform, which had historically been the responsibility of the general contractor’s glazing and low voltage electrician (“LVE”) subcontractors.
The Smart Building Platform includes an upgraded network infrastructure and end-to-end design and deployment services, and also enables next generation Smart Building Technologies. We began offering our Smart Building Platform for the following strategic reasons:
•To optimize the design, aesthetics, energy performance and cost of the entire smart façade (or digital skin) of the building, rather than just one component (smart glass), thus benefiting both customers and View.
•To elevate the window selection and purchase decision to a customer and decision maker that has a more global view of the project and is in a much better position to make an informed decision regarding all the benefits provided by View’s Smart Building Platform. 
•To accelerate the integration of new technologies into the fabric of the building. Today, this includes integrating environmental quality sensors and immersive, transparent, high-definition displays into smart windows. Importantly, our smart façade design enables future hardware and software upgrades into the building infrastructure. 
•We believe delivering a digital, connected façade and smart building platform will enable future business opportunities and pricing models as buildings, both existing and new, incorporate additional technology and connected products.
View’s next generation, smart building network is designed as a scalable and open infrastructure in which the smart window is now another node of the network; in addition, the network is now equipped to host other connected devices and applications, from both View and third parties, as additional nodes on the network. The network has its own 48v direct current power and power-over-ethernet ports to incorporate other connected devices on a standard protocol. Also integrated into the network throughout the building is gigabit speed linear ethernet coaxial cable, as well as optical fiber. Computer processing is also built into the backbone of the network with x86 and ARM processing cores. The network also includes an operating system with capabilities to run third party applications and services, security protocol to protect buildings from cyberattacks, and several elements of a digital twin of the building. View’s smart building network also hosts artificial intelligence and machine learning engines, which View developed, and also provides access to artificial intelligence and machine learning engines that are in the cloud. The exterior of the building is the largest in surface area. With the smart building network, the entire exterior of the building can be digitized. Activating the exterior through digitization creates multiple opportunities for building owners and occupants. 
View’s Smart Building Platform enables other devices and smart building applications to be built and connected to the View smart building network. A few applications View has already built and deployed on its next generation network include:
Transparent Displays: View Immersive Display. Integrated into the smart window and connected to the same network as the glass, Immersive Display allows users to turn their windows into the equivalent of an iPad or tablet — an interactive digital display that allows users a new way to digest multi-media content. Immersive Displays are large-format (55 inches and larger), digital, high-definition, interactive canvases that can be used to broadcast content, host video calls and display information and digital art to large groups of people, while maintaining a view of the outdoors through the window on which it is integrated.
Personalized Health: View Sense. An integrated, enterprise-grade, secure, sensor module that monitors multiple environmental variables (e.g., CO2, Temperature, Volatile Organic Compounds, Humidity, Dust, Light, and Noise) to provide illustrative data and information to building management teams in order to improve building performance and enhance human health and comfort.
View’s R&D continues to focus on not only improving the smart glass product but also on continually bringing more smart building applications and capabilities to market, as well as collaborating with other industry partners to integrate their devices and applications with View’s smart building network, with the aim of making building occupants more comfortable, healthier, and more productive, making buildings more sustainable, and providing better information to building owners to streamline operations and reduce operating costs.
In terms of the value propositions to View’s customers, its earlier generation smart glass product focused primarily on improving occupant experience and reducing energy costs through adjustments of the glass tint. The current generation of the product focuses not only on improving energy savings and user experience through smart glass, it also focuses on increasing occupant productivity, creating healthier buildings, and using data from other devices to develop broader insights that further 
improve building operations and reduce energy usage. Current scientific research supports that cognitive function and in turn, productivity goes up when building occupants are exposed to more natural light and comfortable workspaces; they sleep better, and they experience less eye strain, fewer headaches, and lower stress. In a study published by the International Journal of Environmental Health and Public Health in 2020, researchers at the University of Illinois and SUNY Upstate Medical University found that employees working next to View Smart Glass during the day slept 37 minutes longer each night, experienced half as many headaches, and performed 42% better on cognitive tests. The research was sponsored in part by View.
View also recognized that the new Smart Building Platform offering would potentially enable the company to move ‘up’ the supply chain of the construction industry. Whereas the Company’s traditional offering placed it in the role of a supplier to subcontractors of the General Contractor (“GC”), the level of integration and oversight needed to ensure a quality installation and integration of the complete smart building platform is designed to incentivize building owners and GCs to work directly with View, engaging View to assume the role of the prime contractor for the platform rather than supplier of subcomponent materials. This would also better position View to upsell additional goods and services to the building owners in the future, which could be more efficiently integrated into the smart building platform than with the traditional offering.
Today, View’s Smart Glass products are installed into approximately 40 million square feet of buildings, including offices, hospitals, airports, educational facilities, hotels, and multi-family residences. In addition to our Smart Building Platform, View continues to sell smart windows through our Smart Glass offering and individual smart building technologies through our Smart Building Technologies offerings. 
Our Products
View Smart Glass
View Smart Glass is our core product that includes the following products and services:
Insulating glass units (“IGUs”)
Our electrochromic glass panels in the form of IGUs utilize our proprietary electrochromic technology to modulate ultraviolet, visible and infrared light simultaneously and on command. Electrochromism is the phenomenon by which the light transmission through a transparent material changes when an electrical voltage is applied to it.

Our Benefits
View’s products provide multiple benefits to users, building owners and operators, and more broadly to society.
•Sustainability and Energy Efficiency: View Smart Glass reduces energy usage in buildings by blocking heat from entering buildings and thus reducing peak cooling loads. View Smart Glass also helps harvest natural light, thus reducing daytime lighting energy loads. Building owners can also realize significant contributions to their Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certifications, and path to Net-Zero Energy performance by using View Smart Glass windows. In addition, View Building Performance makes it possible to further optimize building energy consumption by combining occupancy data with HVAC and lighting controls.
•Improved Human Health and Productivity: Independent research has shown that increased exposure to natural light and views leads to significant reductions in the incidence of eyestrain, headaches and drowsiness, improved productivity and longer sleep. In addition, View Sense provides information to report and optimize indoor environmental factors such as temperature, air quality, light levels and the level of carbon dioxide, which have been shown to impact cognitive function.
•Better User Comfort and Experience: While people enjoy sitting next to windows because of the benefits of natural light and a connection to the outdoors, they often feel uncomfortable and are unable to do so with conventional glass windows because of the presence of glare and heat. View Smart Glass mitigates both heat and glare while still maintaining unobstructed views and a connection to the outdoors, thus keeping users comfortable and providing them with a superior experience.
•Improved Utilization of Real Estate: Building operators today often leave the last few feet around the perimeter of a building unoccupied because of the presence of uncomfortable heat and glare. By using View Smart Glass windows, they are able to eliminate this discomfort and reclaim usable space inside the building perimeter.
•Design Flexibility: Many architects prefer to design buildings with large windows because of the benefits of natural light and to cater to occupant preferences. However, conventional glass lets in heat because of incidental sunlight, making it a relatively energy-inefficient material. This has forced architects to either reduce the size of windows or spend more on other mitigation strategies to meet regulatory requirements and user preferences. View Smart Glass, which modulates the amount of heat entering the building, provides architects with greater design flexibility—allowing for larger windows and more natural light while still meeting energy codes and regulatory requirements.
•Future-Proofing of Assets: By using the View Smart Building Platform, building owners gain the capability to make future performance improvements to their buildings at lower costs and complexity, and to potentially realize higher rents or faster lease-ups, which in turn may improve the monetary value of the building. In addition, the View Secure Edge provides cybersecurity protections and edge compute environments needed to cost-effectively deploy and manage new smart building applications over time. Finally, View Building Performance also reduces the ongoing costs associated with real estate property management, potentially boosting net operating income even further.

Our Market Opportunity / Key Trends
We believe that the total addressable market for smart glass will include all exterior windows in buildings and expect smart glass to eventually be as prevalent as air conditioning or elevators in buildings. We expect four secular megatrends to continue to drive the demand for our View Smart Building Platform and View Smart Glass windows in modern architectural designs:
•Increased focus on climate change, Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) and sustainability: There is both a growing awareness in society of the need to reduce energy usage and to mitigate or reverse the human impact on climate change, and growing regulatory pressure to reduce energy consumption in buildings. View’s Smart Glass panels and products help reduce energy usage in buildings and contribute in a positive and material manner to the ESG, LEED and energy initiatives of building owners and occupants.
•Growing focus on human health inside buildings: Based on scientific knowledge and general societal move towards healthier living, we believe that there is a growing focus within the real estate industry by architects, developers and 
building owners to construct buildings that are healthier. The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the awareness in broader society of the environmental conditions inside buildings, including a greater focus on how air quality affects human health. Independent studies have shown that View’s products improve the health and wellness of people in buildings.
•Better occupant experience: We believe that people have growing expectations for comfort, wellness, and experience from their indoor environments and workspaces. Humans spend 90% of their time in buildings compared to just 5% inside an automobile. Yet comparatively, the real estate industry has experienced very little innovation in the last several decades. Independent research has demonstrated that natural light and views are among the highest desired amenities by employees, and tenants pay higher rents for buildings with these features. View enhances both natural light and views through its Smart Glass panels and products, and we anticipate this to be a strong driver of market growth.
•Growing demand for smart buildings: We believe that a confluence of factors, including societal changes and customer needs, the availability of high-performance sensors and electronics at reasonable prices, and advancements in software, machine learning and artificial intelligence, are driving demand for smart buildings. View is well positioned to leverage these trends with a smart building platform, and a growing portfolio of smart building products can be added to this platform.

Manufacturing and Supply
Manufacturing Process
The insulating glass units (“IGUs”) included in the View Smart Glass and View Smart Building Platform offerings are manufactured at our production facility located in Olive Branch, Mississippi. We operate a sophisticated manufacturing facility designed for performance, scale, durability, and repeatability.
Our manufacturing combines talent, equipment, and processes from the semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and glass processing industries. Our proprietary manufacturing facility has been in use since 2010. We currently operate one production line in our facility with a name-plate capacity of approximately 5 million square feet of smart glass per year. In addition, we have partially completed the construction of a second production line at our Olive Branch facility. Once operational, we expect our facility’s name-plate capacity to increase by an additional 7.5 million square feet of smart glass per year, bringing our total name-plate capacity of our facility to 12.5 million square feet per year. We expect to incur additional capital expenditures with 
respect to facility automation and completion of the second production line. The existing facility enables us to achieve economies of scale, as we increase production and decrease cost per unit produced.
The electronic components comprising our View Net, View Immersive Experiences and View Sense products are manufactured through various contract manufacturers in accordance with our proprietary designs. We use outsourced manufacturing facilities to limit our capital expenditures, take advantage of third-party manufacturing expertise, and gain the flexibility and scalability to respond to changing demands for our products. Our manufacturers order components that have long lead times based on our demand forecasts and purchase other components as needed. We do not have any long-term supply agreements with any of the contract manufacturers that manufacture or supply any of the electronic components comprising our View Net, View Immersive Experiences and View Sense products.
Certain materials used by the Company in the manufacturing of its products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers. Shortages could occur in these materials due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one supplier accounted for 34.0% of total purchases.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to create, obtain and protect intellectual property is important to the success of our business and our ability to compete. We create IP in our operations globally, and we work to protect and enforce our IP rights. We consider our trademarks valuable assets, including well-known marks such as “VIEW”, “VIEW NET”, “INTELLIGENCE”, “VIEW SENSE”, “VIEW DISPLAY”, AND “SMARTPROTECT”.
In addition, we integrate licensed third party technology and IP into certain aspects of our products. Although certain third party proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular third party IP.
As of December 31, 2021, we had: 520 patents; 769 pending, published or allowed patent applications; 68 registered trademarks and 44 pending trademark applications.
Raw Materials
We utilize various commodity raw materials in our products, including glass, deposition targets, and glass spacers in the manufacturing process, as well as aluminum for the framing of the IGUs as part of the Smart Building Platform product. Before we use these materials, a supplier must undergo an extensive qualification process, depending on the type of raw material. When appropriate and feasible, we secure raw material supplies through long-term contracts; however, currently we primarily purchase our product inputs through periodic purchase orders, including for glass which is a critical raw material. We obtain raw materials and supplies from a variety of sources whenever possible, although certain important glass components used in our products are purchased from a single source supplier. We believe our sources and supplies of raw materials are adequate for our needs.
Facilities
We are headquartered in Milpitas, California and manufacture our product at our facility located in Olive Branch, Mississippi. Our research and development activities are conducted at both our Milpitas and Olive Branch locations. We lease approximately 804,104 square feet of manufacturing space in Olive Branch under a lease expiring in March 2028. We also lease office space of 77,200 square feet in Milpitas under a lease expiring in September 2028. As of December 31, 2021, we have invested over $400.0 million in capital expenditures, primarily in the Olive Branch facility which continues to be our sole manufacturing hub since 2010. We believe our current facilities are secure under long-term leases and will support our anticipated growth over the next several years. As demand for our products increases, we expect to expand our operations in Olive Branch through the completion of a second production line, but do not intend to add new facilities in the near future.
Government Regulation and Compliance
United States
We are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and licensing requirements of federal, state and local authorities. We are also required to obtain various licenses and permits from state and local authorities in connection with the operation of our businesses, including but not limited to licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to glaziers, electricians and engineers; building codes; and permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects.
Our sales and marketing practices are regulated by federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations typically place restrictions on the manner in which products and services can be advertised and sold, and to provide consumers with certain rescission rights.
Our operations include the use, handling, storage, transportation, generation and disposal of hazardous materials. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the use, management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and occupational health and safety. We are subject to litigation regarding environmental compliance and could incur in the future substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from regulatory proceedings, third party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or non-compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities. 
For example, in April 2022, View and the United States Attorney’s Office for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi agreed in principle to the terms of a global settlement agreement resolving the prospect of claims and charges against View relating to all prior discharges of water without first obtaining a pretreatment permit. The terms of the potential global settlement agreement include, among others, a $3.0 million fine, a $1.5 million civil penalty and a $0.5 million community service payment, wastewater reduction requirements, as well as probation and oversight for three years. In connection with the final approval of the settlement, we expect to obtain required permits or to enter into an agreed order and operate in compliance with such order until permits can be obtained. For further discussion of the potential global settlement agreement, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 9 of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this Annual Report. In addition, any failure by the Company to be in compliance with the terms of the potential global settlement agreement, applicable environmental laws and regulations or any new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our facility is also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. 
We are also subject to federal and state laws regarding privacy and the protection of user data. Certain state data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations may be more restrictive than federal laws. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the United States Congress and various state legislative bodies concerning data protection that could affect us. We take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and certain industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, and security.

Dynamic Glass Act
The Dynamic Glass Act of 2021 (the “Dynamic Glass Act”) is a bipartisan and bicameral, clean energy bill introduced in the U.S. Congress on March 17, 2021 and is currently pending. The bill classifies electrochromic glass as an energy property for purposes of investment tax credit, and amends the tax code to ensure that electrochromic glass qualifies as energy property for purposes of energy tax credit. Under the Dynamic Glass Act, “electrochromic glass” is defined as glass which uses electricity to change its light transmittance properties to heat or cool a structure, which would include View’s products. 
On November 19, 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 5376, the “Build Back Better Act” which included Dynamic Glass as one of five newly eligible properties eligible for the Investment Tax Credit. If certain project criteria are met, these new energy properties are eligible for a thirty percent (30%) federal tax credit. View’s existing and prospective customers would receive benefit from this federal tax credit when they use electrochromic glass. Ultimate passage of the Build Back Better Act or a revised form remains uncertain. 
Canada
Companies operating in the smart glass industry in Canada are subject to provincial regulation of their business activities, including the sale, installation and maintenance of smart building and electronic security systems. Consumer protection laws in 
Canada also require that certain terms and conditions be included in the contract between the service provider and the consumer.
Human Capital Resources
Employee Overview
Our employees are instrumental in helping inspire us to achieve our purpose. They bring a wide range of talents, experience, and perspectives to drive the innovation that is changing the world. We believe in the recognition of employee contributions and, for that reason, we make significant efforts to consider individual job performance as an important factor for promotions, job retention, and salary adjustments. We are an equal opportunity employer, and it is our policy to make employment decisions and opportunities based on merit, qualifications, potential, and competency.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 895 employees, including 596 in factory operations in Olive Branch, MS, 142 in sales and marketing and customer support, and 157 in general and administrative support. Our Milpitas, CA headquarters office has a strong engineering base and a smaller research and development facility. Our products rely heavily on the strength of our research and development, as well as engineering capabilities, and we have 133 employees focused on these areas. We have several smaller sales offices in New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston, and various other locations. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be strong. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement, nor have there been any known union organizing activities at any of our facilities.
Talent and Human Capital Management
Our human capital is governed by various federal, state and local regulations. We monitor key employment activities, such as hiring, termination and pay practices to ensure compliance with established regulations across the world. Attracting, developing and retaining the best people globally is critical to View’s long-term success.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are focused on attracting, developing and retaining diverse teams. We embrace diversity and inclusion and strive to provide an environment rich with diverse skills, backgrounds and perspectives.
Health & Safety
The safety of our employees remains our top priority. We have developed a robust set of health and safety policies in order to provide our employees and contractors with the knowledge and tools necessary to reduce the risks associated with their work responsibilities. Our training programs are developed in response to federal, state, and local regulations, as well as insurance agency requirements and institutional needs.
From the start of the COVID-19 crisis, we adopted extensive safety protocols to minimize potential workplace virus exposure, as the employees at our Olive Branch, MS facility have been deemed essential workers. Our safety protocols include, but are not limited to, specific traffic flow patterns, a check-in system, social distancing, temperature checks, and vigorous cleaning procedures.
Board Oversight
Our Board believes that human capital management is an important component of View’s continued growth and success, and is critical to our ability to attract, retain and develop talented and skilled employees. We pride ourselves on a culture that respects co-workers and values concern for others. Management regularly reports to the Board on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, safety, diversity and inclusion, employee development and compensation and benefits. The Board provides input on important decisions, including with respect to safety, talent retention and development.
Employee Incentives and Benefits
We are committed to providing equity incentives to all our employees through the grant of equity incentive awards under our equity incentive plan, in order to align their interests with stockholders as “owners” of the business. We also provide cash incentives to our employees under our annual bonus program, pursuant to which employees are eligible to earn annual cash bonuses based on a percentage of their base salaries and overall company performance. These cash and equity incentive 
programs allow us to be competitive with comparable companies in our industry by giving us the resources to attract, motivate and retain talented individuals.
In addition, we provide health, welfare and retirement benefits for our employees, including medical, dental, vision, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability, vacation, paid time off, various voluntary insurance programs and our 401(k) retirement plan, which allow us to enhance employee productivity and loyalty through the provision of competitive benefits.
