Item 1.Business 
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, production and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins produced by our proprietary ProCellEx® plant cell-based protein expression system. We are the first and only company to gain FDA approval of a protein produced through plant cell-based expression in suspension. Our unique expression system represents a new method for developing recombinant proteins in an industrial-scale manner.
Our strategic focus is to develop tailored complex recombinant therapeutic proteins primarily produced through ProCellEx while genetically engineering and/or chemically modifying the proteins pre- and/or post-production. We intend such engineering and modifications to provide added clinical benefits by improving the biologic characteristics (e.g., glycosylation, half-life, immunogenicity) of the therapeutic protein.
Our proprietary ProCellEx platform is being used to manufacture our approved and marketed product, Elelyso®, for the treatment of Gaucher disease. We are also developing, via ProCellEx, a pipeline of products. Our clinical development program for pegunigalsidase alfa, or PRX-102, for the potential treatment of Fabry disease is in advanced clinical stages. In addition, we are planning to collaborate with SarcoMed with respect to alidornase alfa, or PRX-110, for use in the treatment
2



of any human respiratory disease or condition via inhaled delivery, and we are developing uricase, or PRX-115, for the treatment of refractory gout, PRX-119, a long action DNase I for the treatment of NETs-related diseases, and a number of other product candidates in early and preclinical development.
Our ProCellEx Platform
ProCellEx is our proprietary platform used to produce and manufacture recombinant proteins through plant cell-based expressions in suspension. ProCellEx consists of a comprehensive set of proprietary technologies and capabilities, including the use of advanced genetic engineering and plant cell culture technology, enabling us to produce complex, proprietary, and biologically equivalent proteins for a variety of human diseases. Our protein expression system facilitates the creation and selection of high-expressing, genetically-stable cell lines capable of expressing recombinant proteins.
Our technology allows for many unique advantages, including: biologic optimization; an ability to handle complex protein expressions; flexible manufacturing with improvements through efficiencies, enhancements and/or rapid horizontal scale-ups; a simplified production process; elimination of the risk of viral contaminations from mammalian components; and intellectual property advantages.
We developed ProCellEx based on our plant cell culture technology for the development, expression and manufacturing of recombinant proteins, which are the essential foundation of modern biotechnology. We develop new, recombinant therapeutic proteins by using the natural capability of agrobacterium to transfer a DNA fragment into the plant chromosome, allowing the genome of the plant cell to code for specific proteins of interest. The agrobacterium-mediated transformed cells are then able to produce specific proteins, which are extracted and purified and can be used as therapies to treat a variety of diseases.

ProCellEx technology can be utilized to express complex therapeutic proteins belonging to different drug classes, such as enzymes, hormones, monoclonal antibodies, cytokines and vaccines. The entire protein expression process, from initial nucleotide cloning to large-scale production of the protein product, occurs under Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP-, compliant, controlled processes. Our plant cell culture technology uses cells, such as carrot and 

3



tobacco (BY-2) cells, which undergo advanced genetic engineering and/or chemical modifications, and are grown on an industrial scale in a disposable, flexible bioreactor system. Our system does not involve mammalian or animal-derived components or transgenic field-grown or whole plants at any point in the production process.
Cell growth, from initiating scale-up steps from a cell-bank through large-scale production takes place in a clean-room environment in flexible, sterile, custom-designed polyethylene bioreactors, and does not require the use of large stainless-steel bioreactors commonly used in mammalian-based systems for recombinant protein production. The ProCellEx reactors are easy to use and maintain, allowing for rapid horizontal scale-up and do not involve the risk of mammalian viral contamination. Our bioreactors are well-suited for plant cell growth using a simple, inexpensive, chemically defined growth medium. The reactors, which are custom-designed and optimized for plant cell cultures, require low initial capital investment and are rapidly scalable at a low cost.
Business Highlights
Elelyso®
Elelyso for the treatment of Gaucher Disease is currently approved and marketed in 23 countries including the United States, Australia, Canada, Israel, Brazil, Russia and Turkey. In June 2012, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion regarding the benefit of Elelyso but did not immediately grant marketing authorization because of the ten-year market exclusivity granted to Vpriv® (Takeda Shire) in August 2010 for the same condition, which was later extended for an additional two years. Elelyso is marketed globally, excluding Brazil, through an exclusive licensing agreement with Pfizer. We maintain the distribution rights to Elelyso in Brazil, where it is marketed as BioManguinhos alfataliglicerase, through the Supply and Technology Transfer Agreement we entered into on June 18, 2013, with Fiocruz, an arm of the Brazilian MoH, or the Brazil Agreement. In 2020, we generated $8.0 million from sales of BioManguinhos alfataliglicerase to the Brazilian MoH.
Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102)
Pegunigalsidase alfa, or PRX-102, is our late-stage clinical asset in development for the treatment of Fabry disease. On August 11, 2020, we, together with Chiesi, announced that the FDA had accepted the BLA for PRX-102, which was filed under the Accelerated Approval Pathway, and granted Priority Review designation for PRX-102, for the proposed treatment of adult patients with Fabry disease. The FDA noted in its BLA filing communication letter that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. The FDA initially set an action date of January 27, 2021 under the PDUFA. However, as we previously announced in November 2020, the FDA extended the PDUFA action date to April 27, 2021. As we disclosed last year, the FDA advised us that it will have to inspect our manufacturing facility and the facility of a third party in Europe that performs fill and finish processes for PRX-102 as part of its review of the BLA to ensure cGMP compliance. Due to COVID-19-related FDA travel restrictions, the FDA has advised that it may be unable to conduct the inspections prior to the PDUFA action date. We, together with Chiesi, are currently addressing this issue.
PRX-102 is the subject of three phase III clinical trials (BALANCE, BRIDGE and BRIGHT). The BALANCE study, which is fully-enrolled, is ongoing; the BRIDGE and BRIGHT studies have been completed. Our phase I/II clinical trial of PRX-102, which was completed in 2015, was a study in naïve, or untreated, Fabry patients which demonstrated a significant reduction of Gb3 inclusion in kidney biopsies from adult Fabry patients. Patients from the phase I/II clinical trial have been enrolled in a long-term extension study. In December 2020, we, together with Chiesi, announced positive final results from the BRIDGE phase III open-label, single-arm, switchover study to assess the efficacy and safety of PRX-102 in Fabry patients previously treated with Replagal® (Takeda Shire), and in February 2021, we, together with Chiesi, announced positive topline results from the BRIGHT phase III 12-month, open-label, switch-over study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of PRX-102 treatment, 2 mg/kg every four weeks, in up to 30 patients with Fabry disease previously treated with a commercially available enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, (agalsidase alfa – Replagal or agalsidase beta – Fabrazyme®). We anticipate announcing interim results from our BALANCE trial in the first half of 2021.
We have entered into two exclusive global licensing and supply agreements (ex-U.S. and U.S.) with Chiesi for PRX-102; on October 19, 2017, Protalix Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into an Exclusive License and 

4



Supply Agreement with Chiesi, or the Chiesi Ex-US Agreement, pursuant to which Chiesi was granted an exclusive license for all markets outside of the United States to commercialize PRX-102 and on July 23, 2018, Protalix Ltd. entered into an Exclusive License and Supply Agreement with Chiesi, or the Chiesi US Agreement, with respect to the commercialization of PRX-102 in the United States.
Alidornase alfa (PRX-110)
Alidornase alfa is our plant cell-expressed recombinant human DNase I product candidate, chemically modified to resist inhibition by actin, thus enabling enzymatic activity in the presence of actin. In vitro studies have shown PRX-110 to have a highly improved catalytic efficiency and affinity to DNA compared to the unmodified DNase I. We completed a phase IIa clinical trial of PRX-110 in Cystic Fibrosis patients in 2018, and PRX-110 was shown to be generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Efficacy results demonstrated clinically meaningful lung function improvement following treatment with PRX-110. On February 10, 2021, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with SarcoMed with respect to PRX-110 for use in the treatment of any human respiratory disease or condition including, but not limited to, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis and other related diseases via inhaled delivery.
PRX-115
PRX-115 is our plant cell-expressed recombinant PEGylated Uricase (urate oxidase) – a chemically modified enzyme under development for the potential treatment of refractory gout. Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in the United States, affecting an estimated 9.2 million adults. An estimated approximately 2% of the gout population is considered to have chronic refractory disease. The uricase enzyme converts uric acid to allantoin, which is easily eliminated through urine. However the uricase enzyme does not exist naturally in humans. We use ProCellEx to express an optimized recombinant uricase enzyme under development for the potential treatment of refractory gout which we are designing to have an improved half-life, reduced immunogenicity and potentially longer-term efficacy.
PRX-119 
PRX-119 is our plant cell-expressed PEGylated recombinant human DNase I product candidate which we are designing to have an elongated half-life in the circulation for the potential treatment of NETs-related diseases. NETs, Neutrophil extracellular traps, are web-like structures, released by activated neutrophils that trap and kill a variety of microorganisms. NETs are composed of DNA, histones, antimicrobial and pro-inflammatory proteins. Excessive formation or ineffective clearance of NETs can cause different pathological effects. NETs formation has been observed in various autoimmune, inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, diverse forms of thrombosis, cancer and metastasis. According to scientific literature, animal studies have demonstrated that DNase I treatment reduce NETs toxicity. Our proprietary modified DNase I may potentially enable effective treatment of acute and chronic conditions.

Our Marketed Product
Elelyso®
Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa), our first commercial product for the treatment of Gaucher disease, is the first plant cell derived recombinant protein therapeutic approved by major regulatory authorities, including the FDA and the EMA. Elelyso is approved in 23 markets for infusion as an ERT for the long-term treatment of adult and pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 Gaucher disease. We have licensed to Pfizer the global rights for Elelyso, excluding Brazil. In Brazil, we maintain the distribution rights to taliglucerase alfa, marketed as BioManguinhos alfataliglicerase, through the Brazil Agreement. In 2020, we generated approximately $8.0 million from sales of BioManguinhos alfataliglicerase to the Brazilian MoH.
Gaucher disease, also known as glucocerebrosidase, or GCD, deficiency, is a rare genetic autosomal recessive disorder and one of the most common Lysosomal Storage Disorders, or LSD, in the world. It is one of a group of disorders that affect specific enzymes that normally break down fatty substances for reuse in the cells. If the enzymes are missing or do not work properly, the substances can build up and become toxic. Gaucher disease occurs when a lipid called glucosylceramide accumulates in the cells of the bone marrow, lungs, spleen, liver, and sometimes the brain. Gaucher disease symptoms can include fatigue, anemia, easy bruising and bleeding, severe bone pain and easily broken bones, and distended stomach due to an enlarged spleen and thrombocytopenia. Epidemiology of Gaucher disease varies; recent literature provides that prevalence of Gaucher disease ranges from 0.70 to 1.75 per 100,000 in the general population. In people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, estimates of occurrence vary from approximately 1 in 400 to 1 in 850 people.
The current standard of care for Gaucher disease is ERT, which is a medical treatment where recombinant enzymes are injected into patients to replace the lacking or dysfunctional enzyme. In Gaucher disease, recombinant GCD is infused to replace the mutated or deficient natural GCD enzyme. Elelyso is the only alternative ERT treatment of Gaucher disease to Sanofi Genzyme’s Cerezyme® and VPRIV.
Our Clinical Development Pipeline

Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102)
Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) is our proprietary plant cell culture expressed enzyme in development for the treatment of Fabry disease. Developed with our ProCellEx technology, it is a chemically modified version of the recombinant α-galactosidase-A (α-Gal-A) protein in which protein sub-units are covalently bound via chemical cross-linking using PEG chains resulting in a more active and stable molecule. It is a late-stage clinical asset and we have completed 

7



enrollment in all three of our phase III clinical trials of PRX-102 (BALANCE, BRIDGE and BRIGHT) which are designed, as a whole, to evaluate the potential superiority of PRX-102 over current ERT therapies, demonstrate the potential for improved efficacy and potentially better quality of life for Fabry patients and demonstrate the safety of our ERT. On August 11, 2020, we, together with Chiesi, announced that the FDA had accepted the BLA for PRX-102, which was filed under the Accelerated Approval Pathway, and granted Priority Review designation for PRX-102, for the proposed treatment of adult patients with Fabry disease. The FDA noted in its BLA filing communication letter that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. The FDA initially set an action date of January 27, 2021 under the PDUFA. However, as we previously announced in November 2020, the FDA subsequently extended the PDUFA action date to April 27, 2021. As we disclosed last year, the FDA advised us that it will have to inspect our manufacturing facility and the facility of a third party in Europe that performs fill and finish processes for PRX-102 as part of its review of the BLA to ensure cGMP compliance. Due to the FDA’s COVID-19-related FDA travel restrictions, the FDA has advised that it may be unable to conduct the inspections prior to the PDUFA action date. We, together with Chiesi, are currently addressing this issue.
The BLA submission includes a comprehensive set of preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data compiled from our completed phase I/II clinical trial of PRX-102, including the related extension study succeeding our phase I/II clinical trial, interim clinical data from our phase III BRIDGE switch-over study and safety data from our on-going clinical studies of PRX-102 in patients receiving 1 mg/kg every other week.
In February 2020, we, together with Chiesi, announced an agreement with the FDA for the Initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) for PRX-102. The joint announcement was made after completion of discussions with the FDA and receipt of confirmation from the FDA in an official “Agreement Letter” which outlines an agreed-upon approach to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRX-102 in pediatric Fabry patients in a clinical trial to be performed by Chiesi with our collaborative efforts.
We have granted to Chiesi an exclusive license to develop and commercialize PRX-102 for worldwide markets; in return, we are eligible to receive milestone and royalty payments from Chiesi.
Fabry disease is a serious life-threatening rare genetic disorder. Fabry patients lack the lysosomal enzyme, α-galactosidase-A, leading to the progressive accumulation of abnormal deposits of a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide, or Gb3, in blood vessel walls throughout their body. The abnormal storage of Gb3 increases with time and, as a result, Gb3 accumulates, primarily in the blood and in the blood vessel walls. The accumulation leads to a narrowing of the blood vessels, which in turn leads to decreased blood flow and tissue nourishment. The ultimate consequences of Gb3 deposition range from episodes of pain and impaired peripheral sensation to end-organ failure, particularly of the kidneys, but also of the heart and the cerebrovascular system. Fabry disease occurs in one person per 40,000 to 60,000 males.
Fabry disease is generally treated with an ERT, Fabrazyme or Replagal. In ERT, the missing α-galactosidase-A is replaced with a recombinant form of the protein via intravenous, or IV infusion once every two weeks. Fabry disease, if left untreated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one. It can have a significant impact on quality of life due to presence of serious, chronic and debilitating complications, including cardiovascular and renal complications, and comorbid conditions such as pain can have a significant impact on the psychological well-being of Fabry patients, which also impacts social functioning. Fabry disease involves substantial reduction in life expectancy. Causes of death are most often cardiovascular disease and, to a lesser extent, cerebrovascular disease and renal disease. The life expectancy of Fabry patients is significantly shorter compared to the general population. Untreated male Fabry patients may experience shortened lifespans to approximately 50 years, and 70 years for untreated women. This represents a 20- and 10-year reduction, respectively.
In January 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to PRX-102. Fast Track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs and vaccines for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need.
In December 2017, the European Commission granted Orphan Drug Designation to PRX-102 for the treatment of Fabry disease. Orphan Drug Designation for PRX-102 allows Chiesi access to a centralized marketing authorization procedure in Europe, including applications for inspections and for protocol assistance. Additionally, PRX-102 could potentially 

8



receive 10 years of market exclusivity within the European Union, with respect to new treatments, if the orphan drug designation is maintained at the time PRX-102 is approved for marketing in the European Union.
Our clinical development program is designed to show that PRX-102 has a potential clinical benefit in all adult Fabry patient populations when compared to currently marketed Fabry disease enzymes, Fabrazyme and Replagal. In preclinical studies, PRX-102 showed enhanced activity in Fabry disease target organs, reduction of the accumulated substrate, significantly longer half-life due to higher enzyme stability, and reduced immunogenicity, which together can potentially lead to improved efficacy through increased substrate clearance and significantly lower formation of antibodies. Providing a meaningful improvement in the health and quality of life for Fabry patients being treated with PRX-102 represents a significant potential market opportunity. The global market for Fabry disease is forecasted to be approximately $1.9 billion in 2021 (Global Data) and to continue to grow at a CAGR of approximately 9.5% (Global Data).
The PRX-102 phase III clinical program for the treatment of Fabry disease includes three separate studies: the BALANCE, BRIDGE and BRIGHT studies. The BALANCE study, which is fully-enrolled, is currently ongoing; the BRIDGE and BRIGHT studies have been completed. The designs of these studies are based on our phase I/II clinical trial which was completed in 2015. The phase III studies aim to show the potential superiority of PRX-102 compared to Fabrazyme in a head-to-head study and include a switch-over study from Replagal and also aim to demonstrate the safety of our ERT. We are also evaluating the potential of a once-monthly treatment regimen for PRX-102 with a higher dose. Patients in all three studies have the option to receive infusions in a home care setting based on infusion tolerability and country regulation. In addition, patients in all three studies have the option to continue to be treated with PRX-102 by enrolling in an extension study.

Phase III BALANCE Study
The BALANCE study is a 24-month, randomized, double blind, active control study of PRX-102 in Fabry patients with impaired renal function. We have completed enrollment of 78 patients in the trial, which is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRX-102 compared to agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme) on renal function in Fabry patients with progressing kidney disease previously treated with Fabrazyme. Patients previously treated with Fabrazyme for approximately one year and on a stable dose for at least six months were screened and then randomized on a 2:1 ratio to 1 mg/kg of PRX-102 or 1 mg/kg of Fabrazyme infused once every two weeks. Randomization is being stratified by urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) of < or ≥ 1 g/g by spot urine sample. The study was designed such that no 

9



more than 50% of the patients enrolled in the study would be female. Approximately 40% of the enrolled patients were female.
The primary endpoint for the BALANCE study is the comparison in the annualized rate of decline of eGFR slope between Fabrazyme and PRX-102. eGFR is considered a reliable and accepted test to measure the level of kidney function and stage of kidney disease. Additional parameters being evaluated include: cardiac assessment, Lyso-Gb3 (a biomarker for monitoring Fabry patients during therapy), pain, quality of life, immunogenicity, Fabry clinical events and pharmacokinetic and other parameters. The study also evaluates the safety and tolerability of PRX-102.
We intend to conduct an interim analysis when the last patient reaches 12 months of treatment to test for non-inferiority to support anticipated regulatory filings with the EMA. Patients enrolled in the BALANCE study will continue to be treated for a total of 24 months, at which point the data will be analyzed to test for superiority. If the anticipated BLA filing results in an approval from the FDA under the Accelerated Approval pathway, this analysis will also be used to support converting the accelerated approval into a full approval. We anticipate announcing interim results from our BALANCE trial in the first half of 2021.
Phase III BRIDGE Study
The BRIDGE study was a phase III 12-month open-label, single arm switch-over study evaluating the safety and efficacy of pegunigalsidase alfa, 1 mg/kg infused every two weeks, in up to 22 Fabry patients. The trial, which is was completed in December 2019, enrolled patients then being treated with agalsidase alfa, marketed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (formerly Shire Plc) as Replagal®, for at least two years and on a stable dose for at least six months. Patients were screened and evaluated over three months while continuing Replagal treatment. Following the screening period, each patient was enrolled and switched from Replagal treatment to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of PRX-102 1 mg/kg every two weeks for 12 months.
Final results of the data generated in the study showed substantial improvement in renal function as measured by mean annualized estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, or eGFR, slope in both male and female patients who were switched from agalsidase alfa to PRX-102. Twenty of 22 patients completed the 12-month treatment duration. Eighteen of the patients who completed the study opted to roll over to a long-term extension study and continue to be treated with PRX-102. In the study, the mean annualized eGFR slope of the study participants improved from -5.90 mL/min/1.73m2/year while on agalsidase alfa to -1.19 mL/min/1.73m2/year on PRX-102 in all patients. Male patients improved from -6.36 mL/min/1.73m2/year to -1.73 mL/min/1.73m2/year and female patients improved from -5.03 mL/min/1.73m2/year to -0.21 mL/min/1.73m2/year. Following the switch to PRX-102, there was a decrease in patients with progressing or fast progressing kidney disease, and most patients achieved a stable status post-switch.
PRX-102 was well-tolerated in the study, with all adverse events being transient in nature without sequelae. Of the 22 patients enrolled in the BRIDGE study, the majority of treatment  emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, with two patients (9.1%) withdrawing from the therapy due to hypersensitivity reaction that was resolved. The most common moderate treatment emergent adverse events were nasopharyngitis, headache and dyspnea.
An immunogenicity assessment indicated that four out of 20 patients (20%) developed persistent antidrug antibodies over the course of the study, of which two had neutralizing activity.
Baseline characteristics of the 20 patients that completed the study, ranging from ages 28 to 60 years, were as follows: mean eGFR 75.87 mL/min/1.73m2 in males, and 86.14 mL/min/1.73m2 in females and plasma lyso-Gb3 were 51.81 nM and 13.81 nM in males and females, respectively. While lyso-Gb3 levels remain slightly high, particularly within the male cohort, continuous reduction in lyso-Gb3 levels was observed of 19.55 nM (32.35%) in males and 4.57 nM (29.81%) in females.
Data from the interim analysis of the BRIDGE study, which were first announced in February 2020, were used to support the PRX-102 BLA filing with the FDA, and we anticipate that the final analysis will be used to support a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the EMA.

Phase III BRIGHT Study
The BRIGHT study was a Phase III 12-month, open-label, switch-over study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of PRX-102 via IV infusions of 2 mg/kg administered every 4 weeks. The trial, which was completed in June 2020, enrolled up to 30 patients with Fabry disease previously treated with a commercially available ERT (Fabrazyme or Replagal), for at least three years and on a stable dose administered every two weeks. To determine eligibility for participation in the study, candidates were screened to identify and select Fabry patients with stable kidney disease. Patients who matched the criteria were enrolled in the study and switched from their current treatment of IV infusions every 2 weeks to 2 mg/kg of PRX-102 every 4 weeks for 12 months. Patients participating in the study were evaluated, among other disease parameters, to determine if their kidney disease had not further deteriorated while being treated with the 4-week dosing regimen as measured by eGFR and Lyso-Gb3, as well as other parameters. In addition, participating patients were evaluated to assess the safety and tolerability of PRX-102.

We announced topline results in February 2021. The topline results indicate that 2 mg/kg of PRX-102 administered by intravenous infusion every four weeks was found to be well tolerated among treated patients, and stable clinical presentation was maintained in adult Fabry patients. No new patients developed treatment-induced anti-drug antibodies, or ADA, following the switch to PRX-102 treatment.

The BRIGHT study enrolled 24 adult males and 6 adult females. The most common Fabry disease symptoms were acroparesthesia, heat intolerance, angiokeratomas and hypohydrosis. All 30 patients received at least one dose of PRX-102, and 29 patients (mean [SD] age was 40.5 [11.3] years, ranging from 19 to 58 years) completed the 12-month study. Of these 29 patients, 28 received the intended regimen of 2 mg/kg every four weeks throughout the study, while one patient was switched to PRX-102 1 mg/kg every two weeks per protocol. One patient withdrew from the study after the first infusion due to a traffic accident.
Following screening, patients were enrolled and switched from their then current ERT to IV infusions of 2 mg/kg of PRX-102 every four weeks for 52 weeks (a total of 14 infusions). First infusions of PRX-102 were administered under controlled conditions at the investigation site. Based on the protocol-specified criteria, patients were able to receive their PRX-102 infusions at a home care setup once the Investigator and Sponsor Medical Monitor agreed that it was safe to do so. Safety and efficacy exploratory endpoints were assessed throughout the 52-week study.
Study outcome measures showed plasma lyso-Gb3 concentrations remained stable during the study with a mean change of 3.01 nM from baseline (19.36 nM) to Week 52 (22.23 nM). Mean absolute change of eGFR values were stable during the 52-week treatment period, with a mean change from baseline of -1.27 mL/min/1.73m2.
Following a survey of participants using the Quality of Life EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, responses indicate that patient perception of their own health remained high and stable throughout the 52-week study duration, with overall health mean (SE) scores of 78.3 (3.1) and 82.1 (2.9) at baseline and Week 52, respectively, in a 0 to 100 scale. Using the short-form Brief Pain Inventory, or BPI, questionnaire, approximately 75% of study participants had an improvement or no change in average pain severity at Week 52 (compared to baseline). The short-form BPI interference items also remained stable during the study. Pain-related results indicate that there was no increase and/or relapse in pain. No Fabry clinical events were reported during the study.
Phase I/II Study
Our phase I/II clinical trial of PRX-102, which we completed in 2015, was a worldwide, multi-center, open-label, dose ranging study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and efficacy parameters of PRX-102 in adult Fabry patients. Sixteen adult, naïve Fabry patients (9 male and 7 female) completed the trial, each in one of three dosing groups, 0.2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg. Each patient received IV infusions of PRX-102 every two weeks for 12 weeks, with efficacy follow-up after six-month and twelve-month periods. A majority of the patients who completed the trial opted to continue receiving PRX-102 in an open-label, 60-month extension study under which all patients were switched to receive 1 mg/kg of the drug, the selected dose for our BALANCE and BRIDGE studies of PRX-102.

The adult symptomatic, ERT-naïve Fabry disease patients enrolled in the phase I/II study were evaluated for Gb3 levels in kidney biopsies and for plasma Lyso-Gb3 concentration by the quantitative BLISS methodology. Biopsies were available from 14 patients. The outcome of ≥ 50% reduction in the average number of Gb3 inclusions per kidney PTC from baseline to Month 6 was demonstrated in 11 of 14 (78.6%) of the patients treated with PRX-102. The overall results demonstrate that PRX-102 reaches the affected tissue and reduces kidney Gb3 inclusions burden and Lyso-Gb3 in the circulation. A high correlation was found between the two Fabry disease biomarkers, reduction of kidney Gb3 inclusions and the reduction of plasma Lyso-Gb3 over six months of treatment.
Data was recorded at 24 months from 11 patients who completed 12 months of the long-term open-label extension trial that succeeded the phase I/II study. Patients who did not continue in the extension trial included: female patients who became or planned to become pregnant and therefore were unable to continue in accordance with the study protocol; and patients who relocated to a location where treatment was not available under the clinical study.
Results showed Lyso-Gb3 levels decreased approximately 90% from baseline. Renal function remained stable with mean eGRF levels of 108.02 and 107.20 at baseline and 24 months, respectively, with a modest annual eGFR slope of -2.1. An improvement across all the gastrointestinal symptoms evaluated, including severity and frequency of abdominal pain and frequency of diarrhea, was noted. Cardiac parameters, including LVM, LVMI and EF, remained stable with no cardiac fibrosis development detected. In conclusion, an improvement of over 40% in disease severity was shown as measured by the Mainz Severity Score Index, or MSSI, a score compiling the different elements of the disease severity including neurological, renal and cardiovascular parameters. In addition, an improvement was noted in each of the individual parameters of the MSSI.
Alidornase Alfa (PRX-110)
Alidornase alfa is our chemically-modified plant cell expressed recombinant human DNase I, administered through inhalation. Recombinant human DNase I enzymatically cleaves DNA but its activity is inhibited by actin, which is present in the blood and other target organs. PRX-110 is designed to be less susceptible to actin inhibition and have higher affinity to DNA, thus enhancing enzymatic activity. In-vitro studies have shown PRX-110 to have a highly improved catalytic efficiency and affinity to DNA, compared to dornase alfa (Pulmozyme®, currently the only commercially available DNase therapy), even more so in the presence of actin. On February 10, 2021, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with SarcoMed with respect to PRX-110 for use in the treatment of any human respiratory disease or condition including, but not limited to, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and other related diseases via inhaled delivery.
We completed a phase I clinical trial of PRX-110 with 18 healthy volunteers, in whom alidornase alfa was found to be well tolerated.
In July 2016, we commenced a phase IIa clinical trial of PRX-110 for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis, and we released the final results of the study in April 2017. Sixteen patients were enrolled in the study, all of whom completed the study. The phase IIa clinical trial was a 28-day switchover study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRX-110 in Cystic Fibrosis patients previously treated with Pulmozyme (dornase alfa). Participation in the trial was preceded by a two-week washout period from Pulmozyme before treatment with PRX-110 via inhalation.
Primary efficacy results from the phase IIa study demonstrated clinically meaningful lung function improvement following treatment with PRX-110, as demonstrated by a mean absolute improvement in the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) of 3.4 points from baseline. Moreover, a mean absolute increase in ppFEV1 of 2.8 points was also observed in patients participating in the study when compared to measurements taken from patients at initiation, before the switch from Pulmozyme to PRX-110.
PRX-115
PRX-115 is our plant cell-expressed recombinant PEGylated uricase (urate Oxidase) – a chemically modified enzyme under development for the potential treatment of refractory Gout. Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in the United States, affecting an estimated 9.2 million
12



adults. Gout is caused by factors that elevate serum uric acid, sUA, levels, which may include diet or genetic predisposition and environmental factors leading to hyperuricemia and tissue deposition of monosodium urate crystals, tophi, in joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation, and is characterized by recurrent flares. Gout flares lead to substantial morbidity by causing severe pain, reduced quality of life, decreased physical function, increased healthcare costs, and lost economic productivity. Furthermore, Gout is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome, and may contribute to myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, CKD, and premature mortality.
Currently available urate-lowering therapies, or ULTs, can be effective in treating gout. Refractory gout patients are those whom, despite treatment with existing ULTs, have high flare frequency, consistent tophi, and the inability to maintain therapeutic goals of urate levels. An estimated approximately 2% of the gout population is considered to have chronic refractory disease and are in in need of other therapeutic options. One option may be a therapeutic use of the uricase enzyme which converts uric acid to allantoin, which is easily eliminated through urine. The uricase enzyme does not exist naturally in humans. To date, two variants of recombinant uricases are approved for marketing: (i) Krystexxa® for treatment of chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy (no longer approved in the European Union) and (ii) Elitek®, indicated for the treatment of tumor lysis syndrome but not gout. Both have a black box warning for anaphylaxis, induce strong immunogenic reactions and have other major side-effects. We use ProCellEx to express an optimized recombinant uricase enzyme under development for the potential treatment of refractory gout which we are designing to have an improved half-life, reduced immunogenicity and potentially longer term efficacy.
PRX-119
PRX-119 is our plant cell-expressed PEGylated recombinant human DNase I product candidate being designed to elongate half-life in the circulation for NETs-related diseases. NETs, Neutrophil extracellular traps, are web-like structures, released by activated neutrophils that trap and kill a variety of microorganisms. NETs are composed of DNA, histones, antimicrobial and pro-inflammatory proteins. Excessive formation or ineffective clearance of NETs can cause different pathological effects. NETs formation has been observed in various autoimmune, inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, diverse forms of thrombosis, cancer and metastasis. According to scientific literature, animal studies have demonstrated that DNase treatment reduce NETs toxicity. Our proprietary modified DNase I design for long and customized systemically circulating in the bloodstream, may potentially enable effective treatment of acute and chronic conditions.
Intellectual Property
We have a robust patent portfolio, which is a key element of our overall strategy. We work to continually enhance, strengthen, and protect our intellectual property and now hold a broad portfolio of more than 90 patents globally, including Europe, the United States, Israel and additional countries worldwide. Our patents are designed to protect our proprietary technology, proprietary products and product candidates, and their methods of use. Additionally, we have more than 35 pending patent applications.
During 2020, we received a patent in Europe for the patent family named “Large Scale Disposable Bioreactor,” adding to the more than 10 previously granted patents in this family. We also received patents in Israel and the United States for the patent family named “Stabilized Alpha-Galactosidase and Uses Thereof,” adding to the more than 20 patents previously granted in this family. An Israeli patent was also granted for the patent family named “DNase I Polypeptides, Polynucleotides Encoding Same, Methods of Producing DNase I and uses thereof in Therapy” adding to the already granted European patent in this family. We also received grant to a patent in the United States. for the patent family “Chimeric Polypeptides, Polynucleotides Encoding Same, Cells Expressing Same and Methods of Producing Same, a patent was granted in China for the family “TNFα inhibitor polypeptides, polynucleotides encoding same, cells expressing same and methods of producing same, adding to the four previously granted patents in this family and a patent was granted in Canada for the family “Use of Plant Cells Expressing a TNF alpha Polypeptide Inhibitor in Therapy,” which is jointly owned with and licensed from Hadasit, adding to the five previously granted patents in this family. Another patent was granted in the US named “Oral Composition Comprising A Tnf Antagonist and use Thereof” licensed From Hadasit.
Our competitive position and future success depend in part on our ability, and that of our licensees, to obtain and leverage the intellectual property covering our product candidates, know-how, methods, processes and other technologies, to protect our trade secrets, to prevent others from using our intellectual property and to operate without 

13



infringing on the intellectual property of third parties. We seek to protect our competitive position by filing United States, European Union, Israeli and other foreign patent applications covering our technology, including both new technology and improvements to existing technology. Our patent strategy includes obtaining patents on methods of production, compositions of matter and methods of use. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation, licensing and partnership opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Our outstanding 2021 Notes are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and secured by perfected liens on all of our material assets, primarily consisting of our intellectual property assets, including a stock pledge of our foreign subsidiaries in favor of the holders of outstanding 2021 Notes.

We are aware of U.S. patents, and corresponding international counterparts of such patents, owned by third parties that contain claims covering methods of producing glucocerebrosidase. We do not believe that, if any claim of infringement were to be asserted against us based upon such patents, taliglucerase alfa would be found to infringe any valid claim under such patents. However, there can be no assurance that a court would find in our favor or that, if we choose or are required to seek a license to any one or more of such patents, a license would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
In April 2005, Protalix Ltd. entered into a license agreement with Icon Genetics AG, or Icon, pursuant to which we received an exclusive worldwide license to develop, test, use and commercialize Icon’s technology to express certain proteins in our ProCellEx protein expression system. We are also entitled to a non-exclusive worldwide license to make and have made other proteins expressed by using Icon’s technology in our technology. As consideration for the license, we are obligated to make royalty payments equal to varying low, single-digit percentages of net sales of products by us, our affiliates, or any sublicensees under the agreement. In addition, we are obligated to make milestone payments equal to $350,000, in the aggregate, for each product developed under the license, upon the achievement of certain milestones.

15



Our license agreement with Icon remains in effect until the earlier of the expiration of the last patent under the agreement or, if all of the patents under the agreement expire, 20 years after the first commercial sale of any product under the agreement. Icon may terminate the agreement upon written notice to us that we are in material breach of our obligations under the agreement and we are unable to remedy such material breach within 30 days after we receive such notice. Further, Icon may terminate the agreement in connection with certain events relating to a wind up or bankruptcy, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors, or if we cease to conduct operations for a certain period. Icon may also terminate the exclusivity granted to us by written notice if we fail to reach certain milestones within a designated period of time. Notwithstanding the termination date of the agreement, our obligation to pay royalties to Icon under the agreement may expire prior to the termination of the agreement, subject to certain conditions.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and significant competition. Competition from numerous existing companies and others entering the fields in which we operate is intense and expected to increase. Most of these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, technological personnel and managerial resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with our current and future product candidates and technologies. Acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies could further enhance such competitors’ financial, marketing and other resources. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize competitive products or technologies on their own through collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
With respect to Gaucher disease, we face competition from two ERTs, Sanofi Genzyme’s Cerezyme and Takeda’s (Shire) Vpriv. In addition, Actelion markets a small molecule drug for the treatment of mild to moderate Type 1 Gaucher disease (Zavesca or miglustat), an oral treatment approved by the FDA only for patients for whom ERT is not a therapeutic option. In addition, Sanofi Genzyme markets a small molecule oral drug, Cerdelga®, approved for Gaucher patients with certain CYP2D6 metabolizer status.
With respect to Fabry disease, we face competition from Sanofi Genzyme (Fabrazyme), Takeda Shire (Replagal) and Amicus (Galafold®). In addition, we are aware of other late clinical stage, early clinical stage and experimental drugs which are being developed for the treatment of Fabry disease by other companies.
With respect to refractory gout, we face competition from Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (Krsytexxa), which is indicated for treatment of chronic gout in adult patients refractory to conventional therapy. In addition, we are aware of other clinical stage, early clinical stage and experimental refractory or chronic gout treatments.
We also face potential competition to our ProCellEx system from companies that are developing other platforms for the expression of recombinant therapeutic pharmaceuticals. We are aware of companies that are developing alternative technologies to develop and produce therapeutic proteins in anticipation of the expiration of certain patent claims covering marketed proteins. A number of companies have developed or are developing alternative expression technologies. Examples include Crucell N.V. (acquired by Johnson & Johnson) has an expression system based on human-cell technology, Dyadic International Inc.’s expression system based on a fungus, Pfenex Inc.’s (acquired by Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) bacteria-based expression system, and others. Companies developing alternate plant-based technologies include iBio, Inc., Medicago, Inc., and Greenovation Biotech GmbH. Unlike ProCellEx, these alternate technologies are not cell-based. These companies base their product development on transgenic plants or whole plants.
Agreements and Partnerships
Elelyso – Pfizer
We have licensed to Pfizer the global rights to Elelyso in all markets, excluding Brazil, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Exclusive License and Supply Agreement, or the Amended Pfizer Agreement, which we entered into with 

16



Pfizer in October 2015 to amend and restate our initial Exclusive License and Supply Agreement with Pfizer, or the Pfizer Agreement. Pursuant to the Amended Pfizer Agreement, Pfizer retains 100% of revenue and reimburses 100% of direct costs. For the first 10-year period after the execution of the Amended Pfizer Agreement, we have agreed to sell drug substance to Pfizer for the production of Elelyso, subject to certain terms and conditions, and Pfizer maintains the right to extend the supply period for up to two additional 30-month periods, subject to certain terms and conditions. In a subsequent amendment, we agreed that after the completion of the first 10-year supply period, the supply term would automatically extend for a five-year period. Any failure to comply with our supply commitments may subject us to substantial financial penalties. The Amended Pfizer Agreement includes customary provisions regarding cooperation for regulatory matters, patent enforcement, termination, indemnification and insurance requirements. We maintain distribution rights to taliglucerase alfa in Brazil.
Elelyso – Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz)
Elelyso, marketed as BioManguinhos alfataliglicerase in Brazil, is commercialized in Brazil through the Brazil Agreement with Fiocruz, which became effective in January 2014. Gaucher patients in Brazil are entitled to receive ERT paid for by the Brazilian MoH. The Brazilian MoH clinical treatment guidelines state that BioManguinhos alfataliglicerase is the therapy of choice for newly diagnosed patients. BioManguinhos alfataliglicerase is currently estimated to be used by approximately 27% of Gaucher patients in Brazil.
The Brazil Agreement provides for a staged technology transfer which is intended to transfer to Fiocruz the capacity and skills required for the Brazilian government to construct its own manufacturing facility, at its sole expense, and to produce a sustainable, high-quality, and cost-effective supply of BioManguinhos alfataliglicerase. As Fiocruz has not satisfied certain purchase commitments under the agreement, we and Fiocruz are currently discussing potential steps to maximize sales of BioManguinhos alfataliglicerase sales to the Brazilian MoH.
PRX-102 – Chiesi Farmaceutici
We have entered into two exclusive global licensing and supply agreements for PRX-102 for the treatment of Fabry disease with Chiesi. The agreements have significant revenue potential for Protalix. Under the agreements, Protalix Ltd. has received $50.0 million in upfront payments and was entitled to development cost reimbursements of up to $45 million, up to more than $1.0 billion in potential milestone payments and tiered royalties of 15% - 35% (ex-US) and 15% - 40% (US).
On October 19, 2017, Protalix Ltd. and Chiesi entered into the Chiesi Ex-US Agreement pursuant to which Chiesi was granted an exclusive license for all markets outside of the United States to commercialize PRX-102. Under the Chiesi Ex-US Agreement, Chiesi made an upfront payment to Protalix Ltd. of $25.0 million in connection with the execution of the agreement, and Protalix Ltd. was entitled to additional payments of up to $25.0 million in development costs in the aggregate, capped at $10.0 million per year. Protalix Ltd. is also eligible to receive additional payments of up to a maximum of $320.0 million in regulatory and commercial milestone payments. Protalix Ltd. agreed to manufacture all of the PRX-102 needed for all purposes under the agreement, subject to certain exceptions, and Chiesi will purchase PRX-102 from Protalix Ltd., subject to certain terms and conditions. Chiesi is required to make tiered payments of 15% to 35% of its net sales, depending on the amount of annual sales, as consideration for the supply of PRX-102.
On July 23, 2018, Protalix Ltd. entered into the Chiesi US Agreement with respect to the development and commercialization of PRX-102 in the United States. Protalix Ltd. received an upfront, non-refundable, non-creditable payment of $25.0 million from Chiesi and was entitled to additional payments of up to a maximum of $20.0 million to cover development costs for PRX-102, subject to a maximum of $7.5 million per year. Protalix Ltd. is also eligible to receive additional payments of up to a maximum of $760.0 million, in the aggregate, in regulatory and commercial milestone payments. Chiesi will also make tiered payments of 15% to 40% of its net sales under the Chiesi US Agreement to Protalix Ltd., depending on the amount of annual sales, subject to certain terms and conditions, as consideration for product supply.

Manufacturing
We use our current manufacturing facility in Carmiel, Israel, which has approximately 14,700 sq/ft of clean rooms built according to industry standards, to manufacture drug substance for Elelyso, pegunigalsidase alfa and other recombinant proteins for commercial use and phase III clinical trials. We maintain an approximately 3,400 sq/ft pilot plant for protein development and to manufacture supplies for clinical trials (phase I and phase II). Elelyso, pegunigalsidase alfa and our other drug product candidates must be manufactured in a sterile environment and in compliance with cGMPs set by the FDA and other relevant foreign regulatory authorities. We are currently producing PRX-102 drug substance for our phase III and other clinical trials, as well as the manufacture of the Elelyso we need in the near future, including the Elelyso to be purchased by Pfizer under the Amended Pfizer Agreement. In addition, we intend to use our manufacturing space to produce all of the drug substance needed in connection with the clinical trials for our product candidates.
In 2017, the FDA approved the supplemental New Drug Application, sNDA, we submitted to allow us to convert our manufacturing facility from a single dedicated product facility to a multi-product facility. This conversion allows us to realize potentially significant operational savings. Our facility’s current capacity can serve all of our current and expected commercial and clinical needs, and we believe it will be sufficient to serve our production needs for the anticipated commercialization of pegunigalsidase alfa.
Our manufacturing facilities have undergone successful inspections by the FDA, the Irish Medicines Board (under the EMA’s centralized marketing authorization procedure), ANVISA, the Israeli Ministry of Health, the Turkish Ministry of Health, the Australian TGA and Health Canada.
Our current facility in Israel has been granted “Approved Enterprise” status, and we have elected to participate in the alternative benefits program. Our facility is located in a Zone A location, and, therefore, our income from the Approved Enterprise will be tax exempt in Israel for a 10-year period, commencing with the year in which we first generate taxable income from the relevant Approved Enterprise and after we use our net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. We expect to be entitled to similar tax benefits for a number of years thereafter. To remain eligible for these tax benefits, we must continue to meet certain conditions, and if we increase our activities outside of Israel, for example, by future acquisitions, such increased activities generally may not be eligible for inclusion in Israeli tax benefit programs. In addition, our technology is subject to certain restrictions with respect to the transfer of technology and manufacturing rights.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We believe that the raw materials that we require throughout the manufacturing process of Elelyso and our other current and potential drug product candidates are widely available from numerous suppliers and are generally considered to be generic industrial biological supplies. We rely on a single, approved supplier for certain materials relating to the current expression of our proprietary biotherapeutic proteins through ProCellEx. We have identified additional suppliers for most of the materials required for the production of our product candidates.
Development and regulatory approval of our pharmaceutical products are dependent upon our ability to procure active ingredients and certain packaging materials from sources approved by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA and other regulatory approval processes require manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications. From time to time, we intend to continue to identify alternative FDA-approved suppliers to ensure the continued supply of necessary raw materials.
Government Regulations
U.S. Drug Development Process
The FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biologics are subject to regulation by the FDA under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and related regulations and other federal, state and local laws and regulations. Biological products include a wide variety of products including vaccines, blood and blood components, gene therapies, tissue and proteins. Unlike most prescription products made through chemical processes, biological products generally are made from human and/or animal materials. To be lawfully marketed in interstate 

18



commerce, a biologic product must be the subject of a BLA issued by the FDA on the basis of a demonstration that the product is safe, pure and potent, and that the facility in which the product is manufactured meets standards to assure that it continues to be safe, pure and potent. The FDA has developed and is continuously updating the requirements with respect to cell and gene therapy products and has issued documents concerning the regulation of cellular and tissue-based products. Manufacturers of cell and tissue-based products must comply with the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or cGTP, which are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of such products. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease.
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations in the United States, and foreign statutes and regulations, requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, product detention, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biological product or drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product or drug for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of a BLA for a new biological product or a new drug application, or NDA, for a new drug;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA.
--+-------------------------------------------

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all subjects participating in the clinical trial provide their informed consent regarding the trial. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject, or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA for review, and to the IRBs for approval.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase I. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients having the specific disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19




● | Phase II. Phase II clinical trials involve investigations in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and the optimal dosage and schedule.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval studies, also called Phase IV trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approvals. These studies are used to obtain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected side effects. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the applicable product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the product candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees which may be waived under certain limited circumstances.
The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort, and may not result in an approval on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may refuse to approve a BLA or NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Generally, it takes one to three years to obtain approval. If questions arise during the FDA review process, approval may take a significantly longer period of time.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s or biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA or NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs and biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 persons in the United States but that sales in the United States are not expected to recover the costs of developing and marketing a treatment drug. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. Among the benefits of orphan drug designation are possible funding and tax savings to support clinical trials and for other financial incentives and a waiver of the marketing application user fee.

20



If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same treatment for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug’s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant’s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar but not identical benefits in the European Union.
In December 2017, the European Commission granted Orphan Drug Designation to PRX-102 for the treatment of Fabry disease. In addition, On July 21, 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for alidornase alfa for the treatment of sarcoidosis.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidate, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between (a) the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or an NDA plus (b) the time between the submission date of a BLA or an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the extension must be requested prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. We anticipate that we will apply for restorations of the patent term for certain of patents covering our product candidates.
Fast Track Designation
The FDA has a fast track program that is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need, the purpose being to make important new drugs available to patients earlier. A drug candidate that receives Fast Track designation from the FDA is eligible for some or all of the following: more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval; more frequent written communication from the FDA about such things as the design of the proposed clinical trials; eligibility for the FDA’s Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, if relevant criteria are met; and eligibility for Rolling Review, which allows a drug company to submit completed sections of its BLA or NDA for review by the FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the BLA or NDA is completed before the entire application can be reviewed. BLA or NDA review usually does not begin until the drug company has submitted the entire application to the FDA. We used the Rolling Review option for our taliglucerase alfa NDA, which we completed in April 2010.
In January 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to PRX-102.
Accelerated Approval
In 2012, the U.S. Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Safety Innovations Act, or the FDASIA. Section 901 of the FDASIA amends the FDCA to allow the FDA to base Accelerated Approval for drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need on whether the drug has an effect on a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint. A surrogate endpoint used for Accelerated Approval is a marker; that is, a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure, that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measure of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. The FDA bases 

21



its decision on whether to accept the proposed surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint on the scientific support for that endpoint. Studies that demonstrate a drug’s effect on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint must be “adequate and well controlled” as required by the FDCA.
The Accelerated Approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Under subpart H of the Accelerated Approval pathway, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. The Accelerated Approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
The PRX-102 BLA was filed under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Pathway.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any drugs for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects with the product, reporting of changes in distributed products which would require field alert reports, or FARs, drugs and biological product deviation reports, or BPDRs, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority, including the authority to require post marketing studies and clinical trials (PMRs and PMCs), labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies, or REMS, approved by the FDA. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drugs and biologics must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Drug and biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, GTP applicable to biologics, and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product subsequent to its approval may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.

22



From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our development efforts. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Foreign Regulation
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
Pharmaceutical products may not be imported into, or manufactured or marketed in, the State of Israel absent drug registration. The three basic criteria for the registration of pharmaceuticals in Israel is quality, safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and the Israeli Ministry of Health requires pharmaceutical companies to conform to international developments and standards. Regulatory requirements are constantly changing in accordance with scientific advances as well as social and ethical values.
The relevant legislation of the European Union requires that medicinal products, including generic versions of previously approved products, and new strengths, dosage forms and formulations, of previously approved products, shall have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the European Union. Authorizations are granted after the assessment of quality, safety and efficacy by the respective health authorities. In order to obtain an authorization, an application must be made to the competent authority of the member state concerned or in a centralized procedure to the EMA. Besides various formal requirements, the application must contain the results of pharmaceutical (physico-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests, of preclinical (toxicological and pharmacological) tests as well as of clinical trials. All of these tests must have been conducted in accordance with relevant EU regulations and must allow the reviewer to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product. Orphan drug designation in the European Union is granted to medicinal products intended for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases and very serious conditions that affect not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. Orphan drug designation is generally given to medicinal products that treat conditions for which no current therapy exists or are expected to bring a significant benefit to patients over existing therapies.
Third Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
Coverage and reimbursement status of any approved therapy carries uncertainty and risk. In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our product and product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Affairs Health programs, and private health insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each payor has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product. Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payors.

23



Possible legislation at the federal and state levels in the United States focused on cost containment and price transparency may impact our ability to sell our product and product candidates for maximum profitably. It appears likely that the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing will continue, especially under the Medicare program, which may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our product and product candidates.
Some third party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices, biologics or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney General offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These regulations include:

● | the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug and biologic product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24




● | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compliance with Environmental, Health and Safety Laws
In addition to FDA regulations, we are also subject to evolving federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In the past, compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the future may require additional capital expenditures.
Israeli Government Programs
The following is a brief summary of the current principal Israeli tax laws applicable to us and Protalix Ltd., and of the Israeli Government programs from which Protalix Ltd. benefits. Some parts of this discussion are based on new tax legislation that has not been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation. Therefore, the views expressed in the discussion may not be accepted by the tax authorities in question. This summary is based on laws and regulations in effect as of the date hereof, and should not be construed as legal or professional tax advice and does not cover all possible tax considerations.
General Corporate Tax Structure in Israel
The income of Protalix Ltd., other than income from “Approved Enterprises,” is taxed in Israel at regular rates. Pursuant to the Economic Efficiency Law (Legislative Amendments for Implementing the Economic Policy for the 2017 and 2018 Budget Year), 2016, the corporate tax rate in 2018 and thereafter is 23%. Capital gains on the sale of assets are subject to capital gains tax according to the corporate tax rate in effect in the year which the assets are sold.
Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959
The Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, as amended, or the Investment Law, provides certain incentives for capital investments in a production facility (or other eligible assets). Generally, an investment program that is implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law, referred to as an “Approved Enterprise,” is entitled to benefits. These benefits may include cash grants from the Israeli government and tax benefits, based upon, among other things, the location within Israel of the facility in which the investment is made and specific elections made by the grantee. In order to qualify for these incentives, an Approved Enterprise is required to comply with the requirements of the Investment Law, and Letter of approval received by Protalix Ltd.
Protalix Ltd. will continue to enjoy the tax benefits under the pre-revision provisions of the Investment Law. If any new benefits are granted to Protalix Ltd. in the future, Protalix Ltd. will be subject to the provisions of the amended Investment Law with respect to these new benefits. Therefore, the following discussion is a summary of the Investment Law prior to its amendment as well as the relevant changes contained in the new legislation.
Under the Investment Law prior to its amendment, a company that wished to receive benefits had to receive approval from the Authority for the Investment and Development of the Industry and Economy, or the Investment Center. Each certificate of approval for an Approved Enterprise relates to a specific investment program in the Approved Enterprise, delineated both by the financial scope of the investment and by the physical characteristics of the facility or the asset, e.g., the equipment to be purchased and utilized pursuant to the program.
An Approved Enterprise may elect to forego any entitlement to the grants otherwise available under the Investment Law and, instead, participate in an alternative benefits program under which the undistributed income (after deductions and offsets) from the Approved Enterprise is exempt from corporate tax for a defined period of time. Under the alternative package of benefits, a company’s undistributed income derived from an Approved Enterprise will be exempt from corporate tax for a period of between two and 10 years from the first year of taxable income, depending upon the geographic location within Israel of the Approved Enterprise. Upon expiration of the exemption period, the Approved 

25



Enterprise is eligible for the reduced tax rates otherwise applicable under the Investment Law for any remainder of the otherwise applicable benefits period (up to an aggregate benefits period of either seven or 10 years, depending on the location of the company or its definition as a foreign investors’ company). If a company has more than one Approved Enterprise program or if only a portion of its capital investments are approved, its effective tax rate is the result of a weighted combination of the applicable rates. The tax benefits from any certificate of approval relate only to taxable profits attributable to the specific Approved Enterprise and are contingent upon meeting the criteria set out in the certificate of approval. Income derived from activity that is not integral to the activity of the Approved Enterprises (including capital gain) does not enjoy these tax benefits.
A company that has an Approved Enterprise program is eligible for further tax benefits, as an alternative to exemption, if it qualifies as a foreign investors’ company. A foreign investors’ company eligible for benefits is essentially a company in which more than 25% of the share capital (in terms of shares, rights to profit, voting and appointment of directors) is owned (measured by both share capital and combined share and loan capital) by non-Israeli residents. A company that qualifies as a foreign investors’ company and has an Approved Enterprise program is eligible for tax benefits for a 10-year benefit period and may enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 10% to 23%, depending on the amount of the company’s shares held by non-Israeli shareholders.
If a company that has an Approved Enterprise program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company, the percentage of foreign investments is determined based on the percentage of foreign investment in the parent company. The tax rates and related levels of foreign investments with respect to a foreign investor’s company that has an Approved Enterprise program are set forth in the following table:

​ | ​ | ​ 
------------------------------+---+--------------------
Percent of Foreign Ownership | | Rate of Reduced Tax
Over 25% but less than 49% | | 23% 
49% or more but less than 74% | | 20% 
74% or more but less than 90% | | 15% 
90% or more | | 10% 

​
Our original facility in Israel has been granted “Approved Enterprise” status, and it has elected to participate in the alternative benefits program. Under the terms of its Approved Enterprise program, the facility is located in a top priority location, or “Zone A,” and, therefore, the undistributed income from that Approved Enterprise will be tax exempt in Israel for a period of 10 years, commencing with the year in which taxable income is first generated from the relevant Approved Enterprise. The current benefits program may not continue to be available and Protalix Ltd. may not continue to qualify for its benefits.
A company that has elected to participate in the alternative benefits program and that subsequently pays a dividend out of the income derived from the portion of its facilities that have been granted Approved Enterprise status during the tax exemption period will be subject to corporate tax in respect of the amount of dividend distributed at the rate that would have been applicable had the company not elected the alternative benefits program (generally 10% to 23%, depending on the extent to which non-Israeli shareholders hold such company’s shares). If the dividend is distributed within 12 years after the end of the benefits period (or, in the case of a foreign investor’s company, without time limitation), the dividend recipient is taxed at the reduced withholding tax rate of 15% applicable to dividends from approved enterprises, or at the lower rate under an applicable tax treaty. After this period, the withholding tax rate is 25% to 30%, or at the lower rate under an applicable tax treaty. In the case of a company with a foreign investment level (as defined by the Investment Law) of 25% or more, the 12-year limitation on reduced withholding tax on dividends does not apply. The company must withhold this tax at its source, regardless of whether the dividend is converted into foreign currency.
The Investment Law also provides that an Approved Enterprise is entitled to accelerated depreciation on its property and equipment that are included in an approved investment program. This benefit is an incentive granted by the Israeli government regardless of whether the alternative benefits program is elected.
The benefits available to an Approved Enterprise are conditioned upon terms stipulated in the Investment Law and its regulations and the criteria set forth in the applicable certificate of approval. If Protalix Ltd. does not fulfill these conditions in whole or in part, the benefits can be canceled and Protalix Ltd. may be required to refund the benefits 

26



received, linked to the Israeli consumer price index with interest. We believe that Protalix Ltd. currently operates in compliance with all applicable conditions and criteria.
Amendment No. 60 to the Investment Law introduced a tax benefits regime referred to as “Benefitted Enterprises.” Under the Investment Law, the approval of the Investment Center is required only for Benefitted Enterprises that receive cash grants. Benefitted Enterprises that do not receive benefits in the form of governmental cash grants, but only tax benefits, are no longer required to obtain this approval. Instead, these Benefitted Enterprises are required to make certain investments as specified in the Investment Law.
The amended Investment Law specifies certain conditions for a Benefitted Enterprise to be entitled to benefits. These conditions include, inter alia, the following:

● | the Benefitted Enterprise’s revenues from any single country or a separate customs territory may not exceed 75% of the Benefitted Enterprise’s total revenues; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | at least 25% of the Benefitted Enterprise’s revenues during the benefits period must be derived from sales into a single country or a separate customs territory with a population of at least 14 million people (starting from January 1, 2012, 1.4% must be added for each year).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There can be no assurance that Protalix Ltd. will comply with the above conditions in the future or that Protalix Ltd. will be entitled to any additional benefits under the Investment Law. In addition, it is possible that Protalix Ltd. may not be able to operate in a manner that maximizes utilization of the potential benefits available under the Investment Law.
In the future there may be changes in the law, subject to the preservation of benefits, which may affect the benefits available to companies under the Investment Law. The termination or substantial reduction of any of the benefits available under the Investment Law could impact our tax expenses.
Amendment of the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959
In recent years, several amendments have been made to the Investments Law which have enabled new alternative benefit tracks, subject to certain conditions. The Investments Law was amended as part of the Economic Policy Law for the years 2011-2012 (amendment 68 to the Encouragement of Capital Investments Law), which was passed by the Israeli Knesset on December 29, 2010. The amendment sets alternative benefit tracks to those currently in effect under the provisions of the Investments Law. On December 29, 2016, Amendment 73 to the Investments Law, or the Investments Law Amendment, was published. This amendment sets new benefit tracks, inter alia, “Preferred Technological Enterprise” and “Special Preferred Technological Enterprise.” To date, we have elected not to have the Investments Law Amendment apply to our company.
Encouragement of Industrial Research, Development and Technology Innovation Law, 1984
To date, Protalix Ltd. has received grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Department of Labor, or the OCS under the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Industrial Research, Development and Technology Innovation, 1984, and related regulations, or the Research Law. On January 1, 2016, the Israeli government established the National Authority for Technological Innovation, or NATI, which replaced many of the functions of the OCS. For purposes of clarity, references to NATI will include the OCS. NATI grants are made available to finance of a portion of Protalix Ltd.’s research and development expenditures in Israel. As of December 31, 2020, NATI approved grants in respect of Protalix Ltd.’s continuing operations totaling approximately $53.2 million (before interest, as described below), measured from inception. Protalix Ltd. is required to repay up to 100% of grants actually received (plus interest at the LIBOR rate applied to the grants received on or after January 1, 1999) to NATI through payments of royalties at a rate of 3% to 6% of the revenues generated from NATI-funded project, depending on the period in which revenues were generated. As of December 31, 2020, Protalix Ltd. either paid or accrued royalties payable of $13.4 million, and Protalix Ltd.’s contingent liability to NATI with respect to grants received was approximately $39.8 million.
Under the Research Law, recipients of grants from NATI are prohibited from manufacturing products developed using these grants outside of the State of Israel without special approvals, although the Research Law does enable companies to seek prior approval for conducting manufacturing activities outside of Israel without being subject to increased 

27



royalties. If Protalix Ltd. receives approval to manufacture the products developed with government grants outside of Israel, it will be required to pay an increased total amount of royalties (possibly up to 300% of the grant amounts plus interest), depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside of Israel, as well as at a possibly increased royalty rate.
Additionally, under the Research Law, Protalix Ltd. is prohibited from transferring NATI-financed technologies and related intellectual property rights outside of the State of Israel, except under limited circumstances and only with the approval of NATI Council or the Research Committee. Protalix Ltd. may not receive the required approvals for any proposed transfer and, if received, Protalix Ltd. may be required to pay NATI a portion of the consideration that it receives upon any sale of such technology by a non-Israeli entity. The scope of the support received, the royalties that Protalix Ltd. has already paid to NATI, the amount of time that has elapsed between the date on which the know-how was transferred and the date on which NATI grants were received and the sale price and the form of transaction will be taken into account in order to calculate the amount of the payment to NATI. Approval of the transfer of technology to residents of the State of Israel is required, and may be granted in specific circumstances only if the recipient abides by the provisions of applicable laws, including the restrictions on the transfer of know-how and the obligation to pay royalties. No assurance can be made that approval to any such transfer, if requested, will be granted.
Under the Research Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder, NATI Council may allow the transfer outside of Israel of know-how derived from an approved program and the related manufacturing rights in limited circumstances which are currently as follows:

● | in the event of a sale of know-how itself to a non-affiliated third party, provided that upon such sale the owner of the know-how pays to NATI an amount, in cash, as set forth in the Research Law (and the regulations promulgated thereunder). In addition, the amendment provides that if the purchaser of the know-how gives the selling Israeli company the right to exploit the know-how by way of an exclusive, irrevocable and unlimited license, the research committee may approve such transfer in special cases without requiring a cash payment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in the event of a sale of a company which is the owner of know-how, pursuant to which the company ceases to be an Israeli company, provided that upon such sale, the owner of the know-how makes a cash payment to NATI as set forth in the Research Law (and the regulations promulgated thereunder).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in the event of an exchange of know-how such that in exchange for the transfer of know-how outside of Israel, the recipient of the know-how transfers other know-how to the company in Israel in a manner in which NATI is convinced that the Israeli economy realizes a greater, overall benefit from the exchange of know-how.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Research Committee may, in special cases, approve the transfer of manufacture or of manufacturing rights of a product developed within the framework of the approved program or which results therefrom, outside of Israel.
The State of Israel does not own intellectual property rights in technology developed with NATI funding and there is no restriction on the export of products manufactured using technology developed with NATI funding. The technology is, however, subject to transfer of technology and manufacturing rights restrictions as described above. For a description of such restrictions, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Operations in Israel.” NATI approval is not required for the export of any products resulting from the research or development or for the licensing of any technology in the ordinary course of business.
Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969
We believe that Protalix Ltd. currently qualifies as an “Industrial Company” within the meaning of the Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969, or the Industry Encouragement Law. The Industry Encouragement Law defines “Industrial Company” as a company resident in Israel and incorporated in Israel, that derives 90% or more of its income in any tax year (other than specified kinds of passive income such as capital gains, interest and dividends) from 

28



an “Industrial Enterprise” operating in Israel (including Judea & Samaria territories and the Gaza strip), that it owns. An “Industrial Enterprise” is defined as an enterprise whose major activity in a given tax year is industrial production.
The following corporate tax benefits, among others, are available to Industrial Companies:

● | amortization of the cost of purchased know-how and patents over an eight-year period for tax purposes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | accelerated depreciation rates on equipment and buildings;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | under specified conditions, an election to file consolidated tax returns with other related Israeli Industrial Companies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expenses related to a public offering are deductible in equal amounts over three years.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eligibility for the benefits under the Industry Encouragement Law is not subject to receipt of prior approval from any governmental authority. It is possible that Protalix Ltd. may fail to qualify or may not continue to qualify as an “Industrial Company” or that the benefits described above will not be available in the future.
Tax Benefits for Research and Development
Under specified conditions, Israeli tax laws allow a tax deduction by a company for research and development expenditures, including capital expenditures, for the year in which such expenditures are incurred. These expenditures must relate to scientific research and development projects and must be approved by NATI. Furthermore, the research and development projects must be for the promotion of the company and carried out by or on behalf of the company seeking such tax deduction. However, the amount of such deductible expenditures is reduced by the sum of any funds received through government grants for the finance of such scientific research and development projects. Research and development expenses which were not approved shall be deductible over a period of three years.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 207 employees, of whom 19 have a Ph.D. or an M.D. in their respective scientific fields. We believe that our relations with these employees are good. We believe that our success will greatly depend on our ability to identify, attract and retain capable employees. The Israeli Ministry of Labor and Welfare is authorized to make certain industry-wide collective bargaining agreements, or Expansion Orders, that apply to types of industries or employees including ours. These agreements affect matters such as cost of living adjustments to salaries, length of working hours and week, recuperation, travel expenses, and pension rights. Otherwise, our employees are not represented by a labor union or represented under a collective bargaining agreement. See “Risk Factors—We depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products.”
