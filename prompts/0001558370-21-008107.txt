ITEM 1: Business.
​
Corporate History and Background
​
Lordstown Motors Corp. was originally known as DiamondPeak Holdings Corp. (“DiamondPeak”), was incorporated in Delaware on November 13, 2018 as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a business combination and completed its initial public offering in March 2019 (the “Initial Public Offering”). On October 23, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), DiamondPeak consummated the merger pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 1, 2020 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among DiamondPeak, DPL Merger Sub Corp. (“Merger Sub”) and Lordstown Motors Corp. (“Legacy Lordstown” and now known as Lordstown EV Corporation), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy Lordstown, with Legacy Lordstown surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DiamondPeak (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), DiamondPeak changed its name to Lordstown Motors Corp. 
​
The Business Combination has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, DiamondPeak was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of Legacy Lordstown and the historical financial statements of Legacy Lordstown became the historical financial statements of the combined company, upon the consummation of the Business Combination.
​
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”):
​

● | Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Legacy Lordstown (“Legacy Lordstown common stock”) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time converted into 55.8817 shares of our Class A common stock (the “Exchange Ratio”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6




● | Each outstanding share of Class B common stock, $0.0001 par value, of DiamondPeak (the “Class B common stock”) converted into one share of Class A common stock, resulting in an issuance of 7,000,000 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Each convertible promissory note issued by Legacy Lordstown evidencing indebtedness of an aggregate of $40.0 million plus accrued interest (the “Convertible Promissory Notes”) automatically converted, in accordance with the terms thereof, into shares of Class A common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, resulting in an issuance of 4,031,830 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Each stock option to purchase Legacy Lordstown common stock (each, a “Legacy Lordstown Option”) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time automatically converted into an option (each, an “Exchanged Option”), which continued to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, we entered into Subscription Agreements, each dated as of August 1, 2020 (the “Subscription Agreements”), with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”), including GM EV Holdings LLC (together with General Motors LLC and their respective affiliates, as applicable, “GM”), pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 50 million shares of Class A common stock to the PIPE Investors for aggregate consideration of $500 million (the “PIPE Investment” and, together with the Business Combination, the “Transactions”). The proceeds from the PIPE Investment provided us with additional capital. Concurrently with the Closing, we also issued to Brown Gibbons Lang & Company (“BGL”) the warrants entitling BGL to purchase, in the aggregate, 1,649,489 shares of Class A common stock (the “BGL Warrants”).
​
On January 27, 2021, we redeemed all of the public warrants (the “Public Warrants”) originally issued in the Initial Public Offering that remained outstanding. The BGL Warrants and the private placement warrants issued to DiamondPeak’s sponsor, DiamondPeak Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), and certain funds and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively, the “anchor investor”) (including any such warrants transferred to the Sponsor’s or anchor investor’s affiliates, the “Private Placement Warrants”) were not subject to redemption and as of March 31, 2021, 2,306,418 Private Placement Warrants and 1,649,489 BGL Warrants were outstanding. Prior to the redemption, the term “Warrants” collectively refers to the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and the BGL Warrants and, after the redemption, collectively refers to the Private Placement Warrants and the BGL Warrants. The rights of holders of the Warrants are governed by a warrant agreement between American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us (the “Warrant Agreement”).
​
Overview
​
Our mission is to be a catalyst in the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, and intend to manufacture the Endurance, the first electric full-size pickup truck targeted for sale to fleet customers. In addition, we intend to leverage our technologies by investing in the development additional all-electric vehicles geared for the commercial market. Located in Lordstown, Ohio, our factory (the “Lordstown Complex”) spans 6.2 million square feet and is in a near-production-ready state. We also intend to build company-owned service centers where we offer maintenance, repair, parts, and other services related to our products.
​
Since inception, we have been developing our flagship vehicle, the Endurance™, an electric full-size pickup truck. We introduced the Endurance™ in June 2020 and are building beta vehicles during the first half of 2021. We are targeting commencement of limited production of the Endurance in late September 2021.

Our Strengths and Strategy
​
Our goal is to achieve a leadership position as an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) vehicle supplier to the commercial fleet industry. We intend to do so by focusing on the following strengths.
​

● | Highly experienced and proven team. Our senior executive team has over 180 years of collective experience in the automotive and electric vehicle industries from prominent OEM. The team’s collective experience includes established electric vehicle production, design-to-scaled production development and traditional OEM processes. This team possesses a deliberate, calculated vision to design, develop and produce commercial electric vehicle platforms and to lead us towards commercial production and sales growth. Our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen S. Burns, is the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Workhorse Group, Inc. (“Workhorse Group”), where he led the development of the W-15, a plug-in hybrid prototype pickup truck. After 12 years at Workhorse Group, Mr. Burns left in February 2019 to found Lordstown and to pursue the opportunity to develop an all-electric pickup truck specifically targeted at the commercial fleet market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Near-production-ready plant to build electric vehicles and strategic location. The Lordstown Complex is a former GM assembly plant that is in a near-production-ready state, with manufacturing lines and equipment already in place. We benefit from the industry-leading machinery and equipment in the Lordstown Complex that has been serviced and maintained using best practices. Consequently, the Lordstown Complex provides us with a modern manufacturing complex with a recent history of producing a high volume of conventional vehicles. It is strategically located in Lordstown, Ohio, in close proximity to the major interstate highway between Cleveland, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Lordstown, Ohio, and the surrounding area is home to a highly trained workforce with experience working in the Lordstown Complex and manufacturing vehicles.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | The Endurance has a unique and efficient design featuring proven in-wheel hub motor, battery pack and powertrain technologies. The technology and engineering developed by us to date have led to operational prototype and beta vehicles that are being tested to meet commercial fleet performance standards. The design of the Endurance features in-wheel hub motors, which eliminate the need for many parts found in both traditional and existing electric vehicles. As a result, we believe that the Endurance will have among the fewest moving parts of any highway-capable production vehicle ever produced. We believe this design will also improve performance, range and safety while meaningfully reducing total cost of ownership due to lower operating and maintenance costs. As a result, we expect the total cost of ownership of the Endurance to be significantly lower than that of comparable internal combustion engine vehicles.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Significant opportunity exists in the commercial fleet market. We believe we are one of the few light duty electric truck OEM focusing primarily on commercial fleets and expect to offer fleet operators the first commercially available full-size electric pickup truck. By being a first mover and focusing the Endurance’s design on the particular needs of this market, our goal is to build strong customer relationships with fleet operators and companies that rent or lease vehicles to fleet operators and to capture a significant market opportunity as the broad trend of vehicle electrification continues. Within this trend, we believe that fleet operators, in particular, will be drawn to the lower total cost of ownership of electric vehicles as opposed to the higher initial purchase price, which has been a factor limiting the pace of adoption of electric vehicles. We also believe that fleet usage, which in many cases may involve multiple shorter trips within range of a central base rather than long-distance travel, can reduce the range anxiety that has also been a limiting factor in electric vehicle adoption. As a result, we expect strong demand for safe, reliable electric vehicles with a significantly reduced total cost of ownership and believe the Endurance has an opportunity to achieve a leadership position in this market.

Industry and Competition
​
The electric vehicle industry has grown rapidly over the past 10 years. We believe this growth will continue into the future as increased offerings, technological developments, reduced costs, and additional charging infrastructure are expected to drive broader adoption. In addition, we expect countries around the world to become increasingly focused on meeting climate goals, in part, by reducing the environmental effects of internal combustion engine vehicles. This increased focus may include offering financial incentives to promote the use of electric vehicles and commitments from major automotive manufacturers to electrification as part of their long-term plans.
​
Our target market is the commercial fleet market, which is defined as commercial and governmental organizations with three or more vehicles. This market is represented by companies such as logistics companies, service providers, utilities, airlines and airport operators, telecommunication companies and insurance companies, as well as small- to mid-sized companies with less than 10 vehicles in their fleets. Government entities, states and municipalities are another segment of the market that we believe will participate in the transition to electric vehicles and represent potential customers.
​
The commercial fleet market presents a large potential market with strong demand for vehicles. We believe that there is significant opportunity to gain a share of this market by offering electric vehicles. We believe that commercial demand for electric trucks will be driven by the potential for lower total cost of ownership in comparison to the cost of ownership associated with traditional gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine pickup trucks. In addition, the specific use cases for electric trucks by fleet operators which often involve multiple shorter trips, can alleviate the range anxiety that has been a limiting factor in electric vehicle adoption to date. By effectively marketing to commercial fleet operators, we believe we have the potential to secure significant and recurring purchases for our electric vehicles.
​
Although competition within the broader electric vehicle and pickup market is intense, we believe that our focus on fleet customers will limit direct competition, at least initially. While established OEMs and new entrants to the industry have announced plans to develop electric pickup trucks, most of these potential competitors are expected to focus on the consumer market as their point of entry into the market. In such cases, the vehicles produced may focus more on attributes that provide for mass consumer appeal, which can be either costly or limit the functionality required by the fleet market. By comparison, we are focusing on the specific needs of commercial fleets with the development and production of the Endurance and expect to have significantly less direct competition in this market at the outset.
​
The Endurance
​
Our flagship vehicle will be the Endurance. The Endurance will be composed of three main components: (1) the frame and body; (2) four electric in-wheel hub motors; and (3) the battery pack. The design of the Endurance body will follow the same design principles that have made pickup trucks ideal for the fleet market, while its chassis will be designed for safety, efficiency and flexibility. Our use of in-wheel hub motors together with the Endurance’s proprietary software, is expected to lead to better traction and handling, making it an ideal vehicle for fleet operators. The Endurance will have a unique design with the use of electric in-wheel hub motors and a proprietary battery configuration. With this design, we believe that the Endurance will have among the fewest moving parts of any highway- capable production vehicle ever produced and will have a total cost of ownership that is significantly lower than comparable pickup trucks that are currently commercially available.
​
Based on our estimated specifications, we expect the Endurance to have a 0-60 miles per hour acceleration time of 5.5 seconds, a towing capacity of 7,500 pounds, a curb weight of 4,200 pounds and a total gross vehicle weight of 7,300 pounds — making it competitive with comparable internal combustion engine vehicles. We believe we will be able to achieve a 5-star safety rating for the Endurance and have conducted software-based simulated and initial beta crash testing that supports this belief.

We expect to introduce the Endurance at a base retail price of $52,500, which would result in a net cost to the buyer of $45,000 if the currently available U.S. federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles remains in effect.
​
While we believe the initial purchase price for the Endurance will be competitive with the purchase prices for comparable internal combustion engine and diesel-fueled pickup trucks, we believe that many consumers, especially in the commercial fleet market, consider the total cost of ownership of a vehicle to be more important than the initial purchase price of a vehicle. We expect the total cost of ownership of the Endurance to be significantly lower than the total cost of ownership of internal combustion engine and diesel-fueled pickup trucks due to lower operating and maintenance costs.
​
In regard to operating costs, we estimate that the Endurance will have 500% better fuel economy than competing internal combustion engine pickups. This is based on management estimates of 75 miles per gallon equivalent (“MPGe”) for the Endurance, compared to approximately 15 miles per gallon for competing internal combustion engine pickups. Management’s estimate of 75 MPGe for the Endurance is the result of our simulations based on the Endurance’s propulsion power requirements for its planned weight and other specifications, as well as modeled requirements for supporting systems. As a result of these simulations, management estimates the Endurance will utilize 0.45 kilowatt-hour (“kWh”) per mile. This would be equivalent to approximately 75 MPGe based on the estimated energy equivalence of one gallon of gasoline to 33.7 kWh of electricity, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (the “EPA”) MPGe methodology.
In regard to maintenance costs, we believe that the capabilities of electric vehicles generally and in particular the low number of parts that will be included in the Endurance will lead to lower maintenance costs. Because it is electric and by incorporating in-wheel hub motors, the Endurance will not include many parts that are included in internal combustion engine vehicles. This will significantly reduce the need for routine maintenance and eliminate the need to service parts and materials for internal combustion engines, such as spark plugs, oil, oil filters, lubricants and transmission fluid, as well as eliminate the potential replacement of those components. In addition, the Endurance’s brake pads and rotors are expected to last longer than those in internal combustion engine pickup trucks due to regenerative braking from the hub motors on all four wheels, representing another maintenance cost saving.
​
Based on these assumptions, over a five-year period, we estimate that the average total cost of ownership of the Endurance will be significantly less than the average total cost of ownership of a comparable internal combustion engine pickup truck.
​
Frame and Body
​
We have designed the Endurance to have similar functionality and a comparable look and feel to other commercially available pickup trucks and expect this design to appeal to commercial fleet customers seeking a familiar design and style. The absence of a traditional internal combustion engine and drivetrain has allowed us to focus the design of the Endurance frame around the cabin to better protect the occupants and the batteries. By using existing and proven design concepts, we hope to reduce engineering costs and minimize issues in meeting safety and technical requirements and in obtaining necessary certifications.
The Endurance body is designed to be fully compatible with existing third-party parts, upfitting options and accessories. Depending on how our timing and demand aligns with the availability and cost of these parts, this design provides us with the option to source certain parts under an agreement we have entered into with GM. This agreement provides us with access to certain non-customer-facing GM parts, including airbags, steering columns and steering wheels, based on the manufacturing capacity of GM’s suppliers. To the extent we utilize this arrangement, we expect that it will reduce the time that it will take to build out these aspects of our supply chain and bring the Endurance to market and reduce our tooling and development costs. We expect to develop some parts in house where such development provides us with better economics and certainty regarding production timing.
​

Electric In-Wheel Hub Motors
​
The Endurance will have four electric in-wheel hub motors. We have entered into supply and licensing agreements with Elaphe Propulsion Technologies Ltd. (“Elaphe”) to produce the hub motors at the Lordstown Complex. As we retool the Lordstown Complex and ramp up production, Elaphe will initially manufacture its Model L-1500 in-wheel hub motors for us. As part of the retooling of the Lordstown Complex, we are in the process of developing our own manufacturing line for the in-wheel hub motors, and upon completion, we expect to manufacture the in-wheel hub motors at the Lordstown Complex under license from Elaphe. We believe the hub motors will provide efficiency, reliability and design flexibility and offer a number of advantages over traditional internal combustion engines. For example, in-wheel hub motors place the entire propulsion system within the wheels, providing a significant amount of design flexibility for the remainder of the vehicle. In-wheel hub motors also eliminate the need for many parts found in both traditional and hybrid vehicles, including a drivetrain, gears, axles, differentials, universal joints, transmissions, oil, oil filters, spark plugs and engine valves, which will reduce the number of moving parts in the Endurance compared to other traditional, hybrid and electric vehicles available today and are expected to drive lower maintenance costs.
​
By integrating its software system with the hub motors, we aim to effectively have a motor and mind in each wheel of the Endurance, providing favorable four-wheel drive traction, control and efficiency when compared to other pickup trucks currently available to commercial fleets. The use of in-wheel hub motors and the absence of a traditional internal combustion engine create a large front crush zone, enhancing the safety of the vehicle and enabling the Endurance to have a “frunk” (a small trunk located at the front of the cab).
​
The motors will be equipped with a regenerative braking mechanism that captures and stores power generated by deceleration of the vehicle. Many of the systems that will enable the use of in-wheel hub motors, such as the software that will interact and direct each of the four motors, as well as the independent front suspension, are proprietary to us.
​
Battery Pack
​
The Endurance will be powered by battery packs in a configuration that we believe will be unique. The battery packs will be completely encased in the chassis, which is intended to better protect the batteries, and enhance durability, and increase safety. Further, the location of the battery packs in the Endurance’s floor results in a low center of gravity, which is intended to give the vehicle a strong yet lightweight frame with advanced handling capabilities. We expect that our all-electric and all-wheel drive vehicles will result in an approximately 250-mile battery range and the equivalent of 75 miles per gallon fuel consumption due to the size and number of battery cells that can be placed in the Endurance. If achieved, we believe this range would make the Endurance highly suitable for most commercial fleet vehicles and should significantly reduce range anxiety.
​
We have purchased units of the Samsung 21700 battery cell for use in engineering and pre- production vehicles and have demonstrated successful use of this cell in Lordstown-designed and built prototype battery packs, which will ultimately be used in production vehicles. We have entered into supply agreements with Samsung and LG Energy Solution to purchase lithium-ion cylindrical battery cells. The agreements generally have initial four- to five-year terms, subject to earlier termination rights, and provide for certain pricing and minimum quantity parameters, including our obligation to purchase such minimum amounts.
​
Facilities
​
The Lordstown Complex, a 640-acre manufacturing facility that we acquired on November 7, 2019, is strategically located in Lordstown, Ohio, in close proximity to I-80, the major interstate highway between Cleveland, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Lordstown, Ohio, and the surrounding area is home to a highly trained workforce experienced with working in the Lordstown Complex and manufacturing vehicles. In light of the Lordstown Complex’s convenient and central location, we envision transforming Lordstown, Ohio, and the surrounding Mahoning Valley into “Voltage Valley,” an epicenter for electric vehicle production in the 

11



United States with multiple suppliers and other industry participants establishing operations in and around the area.
​
The Lordstown Complex consists of four main facilities in one location, in addition to multiple support buildings: (1) General Assembly, (2) a Body Shop, (3) Stamping and (4) a Paint Shop. The Lordstown Complex is in near-production-ready condition with modern robotics, painting, assembly and stamping equipment and requires a retooling investment in order to commence full production of the Endurance.
​
Construction is in process on an 800,000 square foot propulsion production area, which will house production lines for in-wheel motors and lithium-ion battery packs, and is expected in time for the targeted start of limited production of the Endurance in late September 2021.
​
As part of these retooling efforts, we will purchase and install new machines, tooling, fixtures and quality and testing equipment, make additional investments in software, control and other information technology systems, modify conveyor and robotics systems, convert the existing paint line from dry powder to a “wet on wet” process and create new hub motor and battery packing assembly lines.
​
We expect to complete the retooling in the first half of 2021 in order to enable limited production of the Endurance to commence as expected in late September 2021.
​
Key Agreements, Partnerships and Technology
​
GM
​
We have entered into several agreements with GM and its affiliates related to the acquisition and operation of the Lordstown Complex and to provide financing arrangements. On November 7, 2019, we entered into an Asset Transfer Agreement, Operating Agreement and Mortgage Agreement (collectively, the “GM Property Agreements”) with GM providing for our acquisition and the continued operation of the Lordstown Complex. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” for additional information.
​
On April 3, 2020, we entered into an agreement under which GM provides us with access to certain non-customer-facing GM parts, including airbags, steering columns and steering wheels. This agreement was renewed for a term commencing on January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2023.
​
Elaphe Propulsion Technologies Ltd.
​
We have partnered with Elaphe to produce its hub motors. We entered into a license agreement with Elaphe, pursuant to which Elaphe granted us a perpetual license to manufacture the Elaphe Model L-1500 Endurance Motor for use in the United States, Canada and Mexico in exchange for a license fee calculated on a per motor basis. Elaphe is required to obtain our consent before it is permitted to market, sell or otherwise distribute (i) the L-1500 hub motor, any replacement for it or a hub motor for a pickup truck replacing the Endurance within the United States, Canada and Mexico, or (ii) the Elaphe Model L-1500 Endurance Motor for our Endurance or our substitute model pickup truck, or any replacement or substitute Elaphe design hub motor product for our Endurance or our substitute model pickup truck. As we retool the Lordstown Complex and ramp up production, Elaphe will initially manufacture its Model L-1500 in-wheel hub motors for us. We also entered into a facilities and support agreement with Elaphe, and as we transition manufacturing operations to the Lordstown Complex, Elaphe will provide consultation services to us for manufacturing processes, vendor relations and product support relationships as well as on-site support for the manufacturing line set-up, testing and final operations.
​
Workhorse Group Inc.
​
On November 7, 2019, the Company entered into a transaction with Workhorse Group, for the purpose of obtaining the use of certain intellectual property. In connection with granting this license, Workhorse Group 

12



received 10% of the outstanding Legacy Lordstown common stock and was entitled to royalties of 1% of the gross sales price of the first 200,000 vehicle sales. In November 2020, we pre-paid a royalty payment to Workhorse Group in the amount of $4.75 million. The upfront royalty payment represents an advance on royalties due on 1% of the gross sales price of the first 200,000 vehicles sold, but only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such royalty fees exceeds the amount paid upfront. 
​
Other Partners
 ​
As production of the Endurance ramps up, we may partner with key service providers to enable us to serve fleet operators and other customers efficiently and effectively for aftermarket parts and service and charging infrastructure. We are in discussions with major service providers that could provide access to their nationwide networks of service centers. For example, we are in discussions with Camping World Holdings, Inc. (“Camping World”) to build out a national service and parts network. Camping World has a national footprint of service and collision centers and the ability to offer roadside assistance through an affiliate. By working with Camping World, we believe that these capabilities can be leveraged to provide a comprehensive service and support system for our customers.
​
We believe that most fleet operators use service agreements with third-party service providers to maintain and repair their fleets and to provide aftermarket parts, and that an arrangement with a national service provider might be attractive to fleet customers considering purchasing the Endurance. In March 2021, we announced a series of agreements with affiliates of Holman Enterprises, including a co-marketing agreement that establishes a framework for us and ARI, Holman’s leasing and fleet management services organization, to co-market and co-develop business opportunities with our respective customers and a vehicle procurement agreement that establishes a framework pursuant to which ARI would use reasonable efforts to obtain orders for the Endurance from its clients at specified volumes over a three-year term on the terms set forth in the agreement.
​
We are also evaluating partnerships with electric vehicle charging station providers to provide Endurance purchasers with access to their networks. As fleet operators also typically bring their vehicles back to a central location each day, vehicle charging infrastructure can also be installed at those locations.
​
Research and Development
​
We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to complete the design and engineering, testing and certification of the Endurance and to commence commercial production and sales. We expect these costs will primarily relate to research and development activities as we produce, test and validate engineering and pre-production vehicles, integrate third-party components, develop certain of our own components, develop our proprietary software and systems, complete cabin design work and prepare for commercial production. Our research and development also includes efforts to seek to leverage our technologies to develop additional all-electric vehicles geared for the commercial market and electric vehicle related technologies. We expect that most of these activities will be completed at the Lordstown Complex, in Irvine, California and in Farmington Hills, Michigan, by our employees and intend to hire additional research and development personnel. However, we have utilized third party design and engineering firms for certain development activities to date and may continue to do so as we continue to ramp up operations.
​
Sourcing
​
The Endurance’s bill of materials is expected to consist of approximately 2,300 components with its 10 most expensive systems representing almost 75% of the anticipated cost of the Endurance. As discussed above, we have an agreement with Elaphe to license and provide manufacturing services with respect to its in-wheel hub motors, and we have entered into agreements with battery manufacturers to purchase lithium-ion cylindrical battery cells. Motor and battery cells represent two of the Endurance’s most critical components. We also expect that the flexible and compatible design of the Endurance and our agreement with GM that 

13



provides access depending on availability to certain non-customer-facing GM parts, including airbags, steering columns and steering wheels, will offer significant benefits as we build out and finalize our supply chain.
​
We believe we will be able to obtain adequate sources of supply for the equipment, components and raw materials necessary to manufacture and sell the Endurance in accordance with our plans. Disruptions to the supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in challenges in obtaining certain components and raw materials in a timely manner and/or at favorable pricing. As a result, we have adjusted and may continue to adjust our design, production processes and cost structure to adapt to these limitations. Further changes in our timeline, capital resources, business conditions, the impact of COVID-19 or other pandemics, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or that we do not presently anticipate could affect our ability to receive the material we need for production. As we and the broader electric vehicle industry grow in the future, there is no guarantee that battery cell manufacturers will be able and willing to continue to grow their capacity to meet increased demand. In addition, the automotive and other industries are currently experiencing a global supply shortage of semiconductors, which could impact our testing and production costs, volume and timeline. Prices and supply of the key raw materials that will be included in the Endurance and its components, such as steel, aluminum, copper, neodymium, nickel and cobalt, have been and can continue to be volatile and an increased demand for certain materials, whether due to electric vehicle growth or other factors, or reduced supply for certain materials, whether due to trade restrictions or other factors, may increase our costs or delay the timing to obtain the materials or components and impact our profitability.
​
Intellectual Property
​
Intellectual property is important to our business. We intend to establish and protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we develop through a combination of trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how. We have filed several trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, but as of this date no trademarks have issued.
​
We expect to develop additional intellectual property and proprietary technology as the Endurance’s engineering and validation activities proceed. Technologies that we have and intend to invest in and develop include engineering software, powertrain systems and controls, infotainment, cybersecurity, telematics and electrical architecture hardware and software. As we develop our technology, we will continue to assess whether additional trademark or patent applications or other intellectual property registrations are appropriate. We also seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including trade secrets and know-how, through limited access, confidentiality and other contractual agreements. In addition to the intellectual property that we own, we license and utilize key technologies under our agreements with Elaphe. See “— Key Agreements, Partnerships and Technology” above for more information.
​
We cannot be certain that we will be able to adequately develop and protect our intellectual property rights, or that other companies will not claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry.”
​
Sales and Marketing
​
We plan to focus our sales and marketing efforts on direct sales through our subsidiary, Lordstown EV Sales, LLC, to commercial fleet operators and fleet management companies rather than through third-party dealerships.

14



An important aspect of our sales and marketing strategy involves pursuing relationships with specialty upfitting and fleet management companies to incorporate the Endurance into their fleet management programs. Fleet management companies sometimes purchase vehicles and then lease them to their own customers. In other instances, fleet management companies facilitate purchasing or leasing of vehicles by their customers which are generally large fleets. For example, in March 2021, we announced a series of agreements with an affiliate of Holman Enterprises, including a co-marketing agreement that establishes a framework for us and ARI, Holman’s fleet management services organization, to co-market and co-develop business opportunities with our respective customers and an agreement that establishes a framework pursuant to which ARI would use reasonable efforts to facilitate orders from its leasing clients for the Endurance over a three-year time period on the terms set forth in the agreement.
​
Human Capital Resources
​
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately, 320 full-time personnel in the areas of manufacturing, engineering, marketing, sales, facilities, human resources, IT, supply chain, accounting and finance. These employees are engineering the Endurance and preparing the plant for mass production. We expect to significantly grow our number of employees as we prepare for full production of the Endurance.
​
Governmental Support and Regulation
​
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive vehicle safety and testing and environmental regulations, some of which evolve over time as new technologies are introduced to the market. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to our electric vehicles are subject to future change. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes will have upon our business. Violations of these regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties and/or orders to cease the operations in violation or to conduct or pay for corrective work. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses. In addition to the domestic regulations and standards discussed below, we expect to comply with Canadian standards and believe these standards are substantially similar to the domestic standards. Based on our initial business plan, we do not expect to be subject to regulatory requirements outside of the U.S. and Canada.
​
Government Support
​
We believe that our operations at the Lordstown Complex and our business plan can have a meaningful, beneficial effect in a region that has seen significant job losses and adverse economic effects. Our management expects to continue to engage in discussions with local, state and federal officials about these benefits and will explore the availability of appropriate grant, loan and tax incentives.
​
We have accepted an invitation from the U.S. Department of Energy and have started the due diligence process toward securing an Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (“ATVM”) loan. Established in 2007, ATVM supports the development of fuel-efficient, advanced technology vehicles in the United States. The program provides loans to automotive or component manufacturers for establishing manufacturing facilities in the United States that produce fuel-efficient vehicles. There can be no assurance this loan will be available to us and, if made available, what the terms, collateral requirements and timing for any funding would be.
​
Vehicle Safety and Testing Regulation
​
Our vehicles will be subject to, and must comply with, many regulations established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including applicable U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards (“FMVSS”). As an OEM, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet or otherwise are exempt from all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standards before a vehicle can be imported into or sold in the United States. There are many FMVSS that will apply to our vehicles, including crashworthiness and crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements (e.g., those relating to limitations on electrolyte 

15



spillage, battery retention and the avoidance of electric shock after certain crash tests). We expect that our vehicles will meet or otherwise be exempt from all applicable FMVSS. Additionally, there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSS, and though we expect to comply with such FMVSS, there is no assurance of compliance until the final regulatory changes have been enacted.
​
In addition to FMVSS, we must comply with other NHTSA requirements and other federal laws and regulations administered by NHTSA, including early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports, recalls and owner’s manual requirements. We also must comply with the Automobile Information and Disclosure Act, which requires OEMs to disclose certain information regarding the OEM’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. Further, this law allows inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. EPA, and crash test ratings, as determined by NHTSA, when such tests are conducted by the manufacturer.
​
Battery Safety and Testing Regulations
​
Our battery packs must conform to mandatory regulations governing the transport of “dangerous goods” that may present a risk in transportation, which items include lithium-ion batteries and are subject to regulations issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). These regulations are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods - Model Regulations and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by the mode of transportation by which these items are shipped (e.g., by ocean vessel, rail, truck or air).
​
Environmental Credits
​
In connection with the delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles (“ZEV”), under the U.S. EPA’s and California’s Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) rules and standards and the U.S. DOT’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFÉ”) standards for mobile sources, and under California’s ZEV standard, we will earn tradable credits that can be sold to other OEMs. Like the United States, California also has its own GHG emissions standard that seeks to reduce GHGs over time. Other U.S. states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont, have adopted some or all of California’s standards. We intend to take advantage of these regulatory frameworks by registering and selling GHG, CAFÉ and ZEV credits. In addition, we have entered into an emissions credit agreement with GM pursuant to which, and subject to the terms of which, during the first three annual production/model years wherein we produce vehicles at least ten months out of the production/model year, the counterparty will have the option to purchase such emissions credits as well as emissions credits from any other U.S. state, country or jurisdiction generated by vehicles produced by us not otherwise required by us to comply with emissions laws and regulations at a purchase price equal to 75% of the fair market value of such credits. While our plan is for the first three annual production/model years for the purpose of this agreement to be 2022, 2023 and 2024, it is possible that this agreement could extend beyond these model years if we do not achieve ten or more months of production during those annual production/model years.
​
Environmental Regulations
​
We are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, involving, among other matters, water use, discharge air emissions, use of chemicals and recycled materials, energy sources, storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the protection of the environment, natural resources and endangered species and the remediation of environmental contamination. We are required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of environmental permits, many of which may be difficult and expensive to obtain and must be renewed on a periodic basis. A failure to comply with these laws, regulations or permits could result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties and the suspension or loss of such permits, and possibly orders to cease the non-compliant operations.
​
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity from the U.S. EPA for our vehicles prior to their entry into commerce in all 50 states. In addition, we must obtain an Executive Order from the 

16



California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) in order to sell vehicles in California and those states that have adopted its standards. The Certificate of Conformity and Executive Order are required for each model year. A failure to apply for and obtain a Certificate of Conformity or Executive Order will result in delays in the sale of the Endurance and adversely affect our business.
​
As part of the acquisition of the Lordstown Complex, we were required to accept the plant and all property in “as is — where is” condition, including environmental responsibilities. Prior to entering into the Asset Transfer Agreement with GM (the “Asset Transfer Agreement”), GM completed an investigation and remediation program pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent (“AOC”) under the U.S. EPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Corrective Action Program. Upon the U.S. EPA’s approval of GM’s investigation and remediation program, GM placed an environmental covenant on the real property, which requires, among other things, (i) the maintenance of nominal financial assurance, (ii) the limitation of the real property to commercial/industrial use, (iii) the prohibition of groundwater for potable use, (iv) the implementation of a dust control plan and (v) the maintenance of impermeable surfaces on certain areas of the real property. We assumed these responsibilities under the environmental covenant as a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Transfer Agreement. We retained the same environmental consultant used by GM to develop and implement the investigation and remediation effort that ultimately led to the U.S. EPA’s approval. This consultant has intimate familiarity with the Lordstown Complex and has allowed us to develop quickly a thorough understanding of the comprehensive nature of the environmental response actions taken by GM and to implement steps to ensure ongoing compliance with the environmental covenant on the real property. To further manage potential environmental risk, we have obtained an environmental liability policy providing certain coverages up to the amount of $25.0 million as required under the Asset Transfer Agreement. In addition, to mitigate the risk associated with the Ohio EPA’s authority to require future remediation activities at the Lordstown Complex related to historic environmental conditions, in April 2020 we entered into an Administrative Order wherein the Ohio EPA agreed to not pursue enforcement actions against us for historical environmental conditions provided that we comply with the terms of the environmental covenant.

Emerging Growth Company
​
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), exemptions from or delays in being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards and being able to take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. See “Risk Factors - The JOBS Act permits “emerging growth companies” like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.”
​
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following March 4, 2024, the fifth anniversary of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which 

17



means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as measured on the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with such term as used in the JOBS Act. We could be subject to the additional requirements associated with being deemed a large accelerated filer as early as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year.
