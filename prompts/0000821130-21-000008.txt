The map below highlights areas of operation of UScellular’s wireless operating markets.
Business Development and Community Focus
UScellular’s strategy is to attract and retain customers through a value proposition comprising a high-quality network, outstanding customer service, and competitive devices, plans and pricing - all provided with a community focus. 
UScellular operates a regional wireless network. UScellular’s interests in wireless spectrum licenses include both direct interests whereby UScellular is the licensee and investment interests in entities which are licensees; together, these direct and investment interests involve operating and non-operating wireless spectrum licenses covering portions of 30 states and a total population of approximately 51 million at December 31, 2020.
As part of its business development strategy, UScellular may periodically be engaged in negotiations relating to strategic partnerships and/or the acquisition, exchange or disposition of companies, strategic properties, investment interests or wireless spectrum, including through FCC auctions. The FCC conducts auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services. Historically, UScellular has participated in certain FCC auctions both directly and indirectly through its limited partnership interests. 
UScellular has a longstanding commitment to supporting its local communities through donations and volunteerism. UScellular focuses its Corporate Social Responsibility program on philanthropic investments and volunteer engagement activities on K-12 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) to support youth in the communities UScellular serves through exclusive partnerships with organizations such as Boys & Girls Clubs of America and JASON Learning. Since 2015, The Future of Good program has demonstrated UScellular's commitment to the communities that it serves by highlighting and supporting young humanitarians that have taken extraordinary actions to make their communities a better place. In 2020, UScellular began exploring ways to leverage its assets, brand, partnerships, and resources to begin to close the digital divide with a focus on ensuring all youth in its markets have reliable and fast internet access in school and at home.
Customers, Services, Products and Seasonality
Customers. UScellular focuses on consumer, business and government customers located in its operating markets. These customers are served primarily through UScellular’s retail and direct sales channels. 
Services. UScellular provides a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Customers can obtain wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of handsets and connected devices. A postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a device for which a customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. UScellular’s prepaid service enables individuals to obtain services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. Approximately 90% of retail connections were postpaid connections as of December 31, 2020.
UScellular offers various service plans tailored to the needs of customers. Depending on those needs at a particular time, service plans may include features related to, among other things: unlimited or metered voice and data; high definition video features; the ability to use a device as a Wi-Fi hotspot; and varying data rates depending on the plan and usage on that plan. Service offerings vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market conditions - and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers.
UScellular offers advanced wireless solutions to consumers and business and government customers, including a fast-growing and expansive suite of connected Internet of things (IoT) solutions and software applications across the categories of monitor and control (e.g., sensors and cameras), business automation/operations (e.g., e-forms), communication (e.g., enterprise messaging, back-up router for business continuity services), asset management (e.g., navigation system, fleet management), smart water solutions, and custom, bespoke end-to-end IoT solutions et al. Additionally, for first responders, UScellular offers both Wireless Priority Services (WPS) and Quality Priority and Preemption (QPP) options. UScellular intends to continue to further enhance these offerings for customers in 2021 and beyond. 
Products. UScellular offers a comprehensive range of devices such as smartphones and other handsets, tablets, wearables, mobile hotspots, routers, and IoT devices. In addition, UScellular also offers a wide range of accessories, including wireless essentials such as cases, screen protectors, chargers, and memory cards as well as an assortment of consumer electronics such as headphones, smart speakers, and home automation and business management solutions (e.g., cameras, video doorbells, networking and monitoring devices). UScellular allows customers to purchase certain devices and accessories on installment plans, allowing for customers to pay over a specified period of time.
UScellular also offers services that enable customers to replace or repair their devices, including the Device Protection+ program, which provides as soon as next-day delivery of a replacement device for damaged, lost and stolen devices, and AppleCare services for Apple iOS customers. Its Device Protection+ Advanced program also includes local or on-demand repair for eligible devices. In addition, UScellular offers a Trade-In program through which UScellular buys customers' used equipment.
UScellular purchases devices and accessory products from a number of original equipment manufacturers and distributors. UScellular manages relationships with its suppliers to ensure best possible pricing and identifies opportunities for promotional support from its suppliers. UScellular does not own significant product warehousing and distribution infrastructure; rather, it contracts with third party providers for the majority of its product warehousing, distribution and direct customer fulfillment activities. UScellular also contracts with third party providers for services related to its device service programs.
Seasonality. Seasonality in operating expenses may cause operating income to vary from quarter to quarter. UScellular’s operating expenses tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to increased marketing and promotional activities during the holiday season.
Sales and Distribution Channels
UScellular supports a multi-faceted distribution program, including retail sales, direct sales, telesales, ecommerce, independent agents and third-party national retailers.
Company retail store locations are designed to market wireless services and products to the consumer and small business segments in a setting familiar to these types of customers. Direct sales representatives sell traditional wireless services as well as IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) products and solutions to medium and large-sized businesses and governmental entities. Additionally, the telesales and ecommerce channels enable customers to purchase services and devices via phone and online, respectively.
UScellular has relationships with exclusive and non-exclusive agents (collectively “agents”), which are independent businesses that obtain customers for UScellular on a commission basis. UScellular provides support and training to its agents to increase customer satisfaction and to ensure a consistent customer experience. UScellular’s agents are generally in the business of selling wireless devices, wireless service plans and other related products. 
In order to expand its retail presence, UScellular also maintains relationships with national retailers. National retailers sell prepaid devices, and some also sell postpaid devices. 
Competition
The wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive. UScellular competes directly with several wireless service providers in each of its markets. In general, there are between two and four competitors in each wireless market in which UScellular provides service, excluding resellers and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). In its footprint, UScellular competes to varying degrees against each of the national wireless companies: Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile USA, and an emerging Dish as the fourth national carrier, in addition to smaller regional carriers in specific areas of its footprint. In addition, UScellular competes with other companies that use alternative communication technology and services to provide similar services and products.
Since each of these competitors operates on systems using spectrum licensed by the FCC and has comparable technology and facilities, competition among wireless service providers for customers is principally on the basis of types of services and products, price, size of area covered, network quality, network speed and responsiveness of customer service. Types of services and products include non–wireless related services such as content offerings that are bundled with wireless services. 
Technology
Network Technology. Wireless telecommunication systems transmit voice and data signals over networks of radio towers using radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. Access to local, regional, national and worldwide telecommunications networks is provided through system interconnections. A high-quality network, supported by continued investments in that network, is an important factor for UScellular to remain competitive.
UScellular continues to devote efforts to enhance its network capabilities. UScellular has completed its deployment of VoLTE technology. VoLTE technology allows customers to utilize a 4G LTE network for both voice and data services and offers enhanced services such as high definition voice and simultaneous voice and data sessions. 
5G technology helps address customers’ growing demand for data services and creates opportunities for new services requiring high speed and reliability as well as low latency. UScellular's 5G deployment is initially focused on mobility services using its low band spectrum. UScellular has acquired high band spectrum, which it will deploy in the future to further enable the delivery of 5G services. UScellular has launched commercial 5G services in portions of California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin and will continue to launch in additional areas in the coming years. In addition to the deployment of 5G technology, UScellular is also modernizing its 4G LTE network to further enhance 4G LTE speeds.
Roaming. Inter-carrier roaming agreements are negotiated between wireless operators to enable customers who are in a service area other than the customer’s home service area to use wireless services in that service area. UScellular has entered into 4G LTE and VoLTE roaming agreements with national wireless companies and, as a result, customers have access to these services on a nationwide basis. In addition, UScellular offers a variety of international roaming options. UScellular is pursuing and expects to introduce 5G roaming in 2021. 
Regulation
UScellular’s operations are subject to federal, state and local regulation. Key regulatory considerations are discussed below.
The construction, operation and transfer of wireless systems in the United States are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act). The FCC currently does not require wireless carriers to comply with a number of statutory provisions otherwise applicable to common carriers that provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications. However, the FCC has enacted regulations governing construction and operation of wireless systems, licensing (including renewal of wireless spectrum licenses) and technical standards for the provision of wireless services under the Communications Act.
Wireless spectrum licenses segmented by geographic areas are granted by the FCC. The completion of acquisitions, involving the transfer of control of all or a portion of a wireless system, requires prior FCC approval. The FCC determines on a case-by-case basis whether an acquisition of wireless spectrum licenses is in the public interest. Wireless spectrum licenses are granted generally for a ten-year term or, in some cases, for a twelve-year or fifteen-year term. The FCC establishes the standards for conducting comparative renewal proceedings between a wireless license holder seeking renewal of its license and challengers filing competing applications. All of UScellular’s wireless spectrum licenses for which it applied for renewal since 1995 have been renewed. UScellular expects to continue to meet the criteria of the FCC’s license renewal process.
As part of its data services, UScellular provides internet access. Such internet access services may be subject to different regulatory requirements than other wireless services.
Although the Communications Act generally pre-empts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless services, including billing, termination of service arrangements, imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of handsets while driving, zoning, land use, privacy, data security and consumer protection. Further, the Federal Aviation Administration also regulates the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae.
Reference is made to Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K under “Regulatory Matters” for information regarding any significant recent developments and proposals relating to the foregoing regulatory matters.
Human Capital Resources
UScellular had approximately 5,300 full-time and part-time employees as of December 31, 2020. Employee engagement and development is critical to the success of UScellular. UScellular periodically surveys its employees; those surveys have consistently shown that employees have strong engagement and high overall job satisfaction. UScellular offers education assistance, development assignments, and mentoring programs to assist in employee development. Additionally, UScellular sponsors various employee resource groups to build small, connected communities within its workforce and promote diverse, inclusive experiences. UScellular supports the communities it serves and encourages employees to volunteer and support local organizations and community groups.
