ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (the "Company", "we" or "us") is one of the world’s largest out-of-home advertising companies and the only global out-of-home advertising company with scaled presence in the United States ("U.S.") and Europe. With more than 500,000 advertising displays (including airport structures) spanning 31 countries, we deliver our clients’ marketing campaigns internationally, nationally and locally, enabling advertisers to engage with consumers through our portfolio of out-of-home advertising displays in many of the most desirable markets across the globe.
Our global asset portfolio primarily consists of the following advertising structures:
•print billboards, which are a recognizable medium for delivering big brand messages with broad reach;
•digital billboards, usually in high-traffic commercial areas, which may display advertisements for multiple customers and can change messages throughout the course of a day;
•street furniture displays, the largest element of our international portfolio, which generally focus on urban city centers;
•transit displays, such as bus and rail displays, which provide high-profile exposure throughout communities;
•airport displays, which target travelers with high “dwell times” and multiple exposures for high-frequency campaigns; and
•spectaculars and wallscapes, which are high-profile, high-impact advertising structures erected in mass consumer locations, such as Times Square and Sunset Boulevard, designed to attract maximum attention.
Our business model focuses on building strong customer relationships and leveraging our diverse global asset base to provide customized advertising solutions. Our strategy centers on transforming the way we do business by applying cutting-edge technology to the out-of-home advertising experience, including continuing our expansion of digital displays across our entire asset portfolio. As an industry leader in the development of out-of-home programmatic buying capabilities and the utilization of data and analytics to prove attribution and improve campaign planning and effectiveness, we are a pioneer in the out-of-home technology-fueled transformation that is further enhancing our ability to monetize our digital inventory.
Through our extensive display inventory and technology-based enhancements, we have the ability to deliver innovative, effective marketing campaigns for advertising partners globally, in their target markets, connecting brands with the people they want to reach with ideas that enlighten, entertain and influence them. In the U.S., we are present in 42 out of the top 50 designated market areas (“DMAs”), as well as all top 20 DMAs. Our portfolio in our Europe segment spans 17 countries (16 European countries plus Singapore) and is focused on densely populated metropolitan areas. We also have advertising assets in four countries across Latin America. Our diverse global portfolio gives us exposure to a range of macro-economic, regulatory and media environments, the ability to leverage technology investments and leadership across the portfolio, and the opportunity to develop global relationships with the world’s largest advertisers and agencies.
We believe that with our reach, technology and global asset base, we can provide our clients with a more effective method to reach their audiences and deliver their messages in an impactful manner compared to other traditional advertising mediums.
Development of our Business
Prior to May 1, 2019, we were indirectly owned by iHeartCommunications, Inc. (“iHeartCommunications”) and its parent company, iHeartMedia, Inc. (“iHeartMedia”). On May 1, 2019 (the "Effective Date"), we separated from, and ceased to be controlled by, iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries (the "Separation"). Refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 27, 2020, for a full discussion of our corporate history prior to 2020.
In April 2020, following a strategic review of our investment in China, we sold our 50.91% stake in Clear Media Limited (“Clear Media”).
Macroeconomic Indicators and Seasonality
Advertising revenue for our business is highly correlated to changes in gross domestic product (“GDP”) as advertising spending has historically trended in line with GDP, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, our international results are impacted by the economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

We typically experience our lowest financial performance in the first quarter of the calendar year, which is generally offset during the remainder of the year as our business typically experiences its strongest performance in the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. However, our financial performance in 2020 was severely impacted by COVID-19, as further described below.
Our Industry
    We believe out-of-home advertising enjoys a strong and unique position in the media mix, offering advertisers an opportunity to reach consumers when they are out of the home and close to making purchase decisions through a cost-effective advertising medium.
Out-of-home has the broadest reach among all forms of media, reaching more adults in the U.S. on a weekly basis than radio, TV and the Internet, according to data provided by Scarborough Research. We reach our audience while they are on the move through billboards, transit displays and street furniture located in major commuter locations such as airports, bus networks and railways. With the growth of digital media and the use of data, advertisers can build on this location-targeting ability and alter advertising messages based on environmental conditions, including time of day and weather, making them all the more relevant and effective to their target audience.
Since the inception of the Internet, other traditional media has faced the challenge of online content migration, which has fragmented their audiences and reduced their reach. Out-of-home, on the other hand, has seen its audience grow through increased urbanization and time spent out of the home, in particular, benefiting from the development and worldwide use of the mobile phone. As a consequence, traditional forms of media have lost market share of ad spend, while out-of-home has seen healthy growth. According to data published by Magna Global in December 2020, global revenues in the out-of-home sector are expected to grow at a 4.6% compounded annual growth rate from 2022 to 2025 following the current economic downturn and recovery period, significantly faster than other traditional mediums.
The out-of-home sector in the U.S., particularly billboards, is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels, which provides stability to our market position. In other advertising locations within the U.S. market (such as airports, other transit hubs or shopping malls) and in international markets, barriers to entry arise due to the complexity of operating major advertising concessions in these environments. We have developed long-standing municipality and other landlord partner relationships across our markets with long-term contracts and strong forward visibility, and we believe we can leverage our expertise to continue to expand our business.
Our Vision
    Our vision is to create a unique, mass-reach, global media platform that delivers our clients' messages across our distinctive portfolio of digital and traditional displays. We believe out-of-home advertising has opportunities to further improve its value proposition and capture an even greater share of the global advertising market, and part of our vision is to make out-of-home advertising as easy to plan, buy and measure as an online campaign, but with increased impact and reduced brand risk.
The key pillars of our vision are:
•Growing the out-of-home medium. Our strategy is, first and foremost, to grow out-of-home advertising’s share of total media spend by leading the technology-driven transformation of the medium, and to grow our share of total out-of-home advertising spend by leveraging our distinctive global asset base and operations in key markets with strong demographic strengths.
•Technological leadership. Technological advances continue to transform the out-of-home advertising sector and drive growth in the medium overall. We seek to leverage our leadership position in out-of-home technology and data to enhance out-of-home advertising's core proposition through digital displays, making the medium even more flexible and creative to draw consumer interest; to make out-of-home advertisements even easier to plan and buy; and to provide customers with proof of campaign delivery and return on investment.
•Customer focus. We enable advertisers to engage with consumers through innovative advertising solutions that deliver results by putting our portfolio to work in smart and distinctive ways, including differentiating our products through innovation, sales and service. We seek to further develop our sales excellence by using sophisticated revenue management tools to optimize the yield of our asset base, and we are focused on developing our networks of locations into compelling propositions by selling the audience attributes rather than the individual display. We believe that this customer focus, as well as our distinctive global presence and scale, allows us to build relationships with key global advertisers across our portfolio.

•Opportunistic expansion. Part of our long-term vision is to leverage our operational performance to optimize our capital structure, pursue opportunities for acquisitions in a fragmented marketplace and exploit potential for portfolio expansion with acquisitions benefiting from our technology platform. Despite the current challenges of COVID-19, we believe that there are opportunities for expansion in the fragmented out-of-home space, and we remain open to opportunities that accelerate our path to creating enhanced value for shareholders. However, given the current economic environment, our immediate focus is on continuing to own, operate and enhance the value of our existing portfolio of assets.
Our Strategies
Promote outdoor media spending.
Given the attractive industry fundamentals of outdoor media and the depth and breadth of our relationships with advertisers, we believe we can drive out-of-home advertising's share of total media spend by using executive, marketing and dedicated sales teams to highlight the value of out-of-home advertising relative to other media. As part of our effort to promote growth in out-of-home advertising’s share of total media, we are focused on developing and implementing improved out-of-home audience delivery measurement systems to provide advertisers with tools to plan their campaigns and determine how effectively their message is reaching the desired audience.
    We are at the forefront of integrating out-of-home media with data analytics and attribution, and we have made and continue to make significant investments in research tools like Clear Channel Outdoor RADAR (“RADAR”), our proprietary suite of data-driven solutions for planning, amplifying and measuring the impact of out-of-home advertising. First launched in our Americas business in 2016, RADAR is the industry’s first suite of campaign planning, amplification and attribution solutions that utilizes aggregated and anonymized mobile data insights to help brands reach desired audiences, reengage these audiences across other media platforms, and measure what happens after someone is exposed to an advertisement on printed and digital displays. RADAR offers advertisers an easier way to unlock the value of out-home advertising by applying the same approach from the online world to the physical world’s largest screens. In 2020, we launched RADAR in our European business, with successful roll-outs in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Spain, with other markets to follow.
Continued digitization of our portfolio and capabilities.
We were an early adopter of digital displays, and we continue to invest opportunistically in digital conversion both domestically and internationally. Digitization of the asset base has been a proven driver of growth in the out-of-home sector and for us in particular. Digital displays enhance the core proposition of out-of-home advertising by improving the quality of display, enabling greater utilization of our best advertising locations through sequential displays, allowing advertisers to plan campaigns around specific days or times of day, and enhancing creativity and contextual relevance of advertisements by tailoring messages according to specific locations, times or other inputs. Digitization of the asset base also provides highly attractive economics, and we believe we have established leadership in unlocking the full benefits of a digital portfolio, including improving sales force capability; developing sophisticated pricing and packaging, campaign delivery, and measurement tools; developing flexible propositions, which allow us to change content by time of day and quickly change messaging based on advertisers’ needs; and automation. Additionally, digital technology allows us to transition from selling space on a display to a single advertiser to selling time on that display to multiple advertisers, creating new revenue opportunities from both new and existing customers. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had more than 19,000 digital displays worldwide, and revenue from digital displays accounted for approximately 31% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, up from 29% for the year ended December 31, 2019. As we move through the economic downturn resulting from COVID-19, we are seeing benefits from our continued investments in technology and the global expansion of our digital footprint, which provides us with the flexibility to quickly ramp-up advertising campaigns and most effectively target the right audiences at the right time. A core element of our capital allocation strategy has been the continued digitization of our displays, and although we are taking a highly disciplined approach in managing our use of cash during the economic downturn, we remain committed to the development of digital out-of-home communication solutions, which we believe will serve to better position our business to meet our customers’ needs. The underlying fundamentals of the out-of-home industry remain attractive and are expected to continue to grow faster than traditional advertising over the long-term, with digital out-of-home driving that growth. According to data published by Magna Global in December 2020, the digital out-of-home sector is expected to grow at a 13.4% compounded annual growth rate from 2022 to 2025 following the current economic downturn and recovery period, and we hope to capture a significant share of this growth.

Improving our programmatic platform.
 Historically, out-of-home campaigns have been relatively hard to buy, with a fragmented media owner landscape, long lead times and relatively inflexible display periods. However, with continued digitization, we are able to leverage technology for ad-buying, and we have become an industry-leader in providing clients with a flexible buying model via a real-time, biddable digital out-of-home marketplace solution. This programmatic platform introduces ease and efficiency to the out-of-home advertising sales process by enabling marketers to buy our out-of-home inventory in audience-based packages, giving them the ability to manage their campaigns on a self-service basis and empowering them with a level of flexibility closest to online platforms relative to other traditional ad mediums. We intend to continue focusing on our programmatic efforts to further develop automated sales technology with the objectives of targeting “new” media spend from digital and mobile markets and making our medium easier to buy so that we can continue to capture advertising dollars from other traditional ad mediums. 
Investing in data and analytics technologies.
    Out-of-home advertising has historically suffered from less measurability than some of its peers, both in terms of the specific audience that views a campaign and the attribution of post-exposure activity. However, digitization, programmatic buying, and the pervasive presence of smartphones and other mobile devices generates an enormous amount of data, and our investments in data and analytics over the last several years have allowed us to use anonymous mobile location data to deliver powerful insights for our campaigns through our suite of RADAR products. The insights RADAR provides, in conjunction with flexible ad-buying, enable our clients to deliver highly customized, targeted and measurable out-of-home campaigns, resulting in a more sophisticated approach to delivering messages to the right audience in the right location at the right time. By providing our clients with industry-leading measurement tools for optimization of end-to-end out-of-home campaigns, RADAR is helping us to demonstrate the value of out-of-home advertising and is positioning us as an industry innovator and a true partner to our clients. 
We believe the technology investments we have made in building out our RADAR platform position us to better meet our customers’ needs as we move through the economic downturn resulting from COVID-19. During this time, our customers have continued to use RADAR as a vital tool allowing brands to effectively plan and measure their out-of-home campaigns against specific audience segments, especially as traffic patterns changed over the course of the pandemic. For example, in the U.S., we saw an increase in average visitation rates to essential businesses during the pandemic as a result of out-of-home ad exposure, which, in some cases, was higher than pre-COVID visitation rates. We believe we can drive revenue growth by continuing to improve audience insights and data solutions to make campaigns more relevant and by utilizing sophisticated tools to unlock value in revenue management and campaign optimization.
Pursuing opportunistic transactions.
Another component of our long-term strategy is to grow our relevance to our advertising customers by continuously optimizing our portfolio, targeting selective investments in promising market segments and capitalizing on product and geographic opportunities. In the past, we frequently evaluated potential merger and acquisition situations, and, in many cases, identified opportunities to capture synergies, achieve network effects or expand into new markets through the opportunistic acquisition of companies, assets and technologies that fit in with our long-term strategy and vision.
We are focused on taking the necessary steps to de-lever our balance sheet, enhance financial flexibility and invest in the growth of our higher margin markets, particularly in the Americas. As we continue to focus on operational efficiencies that drive greater margin and cash flow, we may from time to time in the future consider strategic transactions, including, among other things, the sale of one or more of our markets or businesses.
COVID-19
Effects on Economy, Industry & Company
In December 2019, it was first reported that there had been an outbreak of a new coronavirus (“COVID-19”), and in March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In an effort to reduce transmission of the virus, governments around the world initially implemented lock-downs and placed significant restrictions on travel and transportation, and consumers significantly reduced time spent out-of-home. COVID-19 also resulted in volatile economic conditions, business disruptions across the globe and reductions in consumer spending. COVID-19’s extensive impact on the overall economy and on the global advertising market in particular has had a significant adverse impact on our business.
Table of Contents

Starting in March 2020, we observed lock-downs limiting the behavior and movement of consumers and target audiences, which caused a significant decrease in out-of-home audience metrics indicating a reduction in consumer advertising display engagement; a sharp decline in customer bookings as customers deferred advertising buying decisions and reduced marketing spend; an unprecedented level of requests to defer, revise or cancel sales contracts as customers sought to conserve cash; and customers forced to close their businesses temporarily or permanently. As lock-downs and restrictions lifted, the negative impacts of COVID-19 began to lessen during the last weeks of the second quarter, and we saw an increase in mobility, traffic and other out-of-home metrics. During the third quarter, out-of-home metrics, travel patterns, consumer behavior and economic activity improved to varying degrees across our global platform but remained significantly below historic norms. However, the resurgence in COVID-19 cases during the fourth quarter caused certain restrictions to be reinstated, causing the positive momentum to slow down. Additionally, new mobility restrictions in European countries created significant volatility in our Europe segment booking activity.
In December 2020, it was announced that several COVID-19 vaccines had been authorized by certain national regulatory authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) in the U.S., and the first vaccines were administered. It is expected that more vaccines will be authorized and rolled out over the coming months as large clinical trials are completed. Still, the duration and severity of the effects of the pandemic, which is still ongoing as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, continue to evolve and remain unknown. Additionally, it remains unclear when we will see stabilized out-of-home metrics translate into a return to typical out-of-home advertising buying levels.
Company Response
In response to the pandemic, we have used our advertising inventory to facilitate messages of support to medical teams, first responders, delivery professionals, food service workers and many other key workers in all parts of the world; to provide support to governments in helping remind citizens to observe restrictions and how to stay safe; and to shine a light on essential businesses that remained open during the pandemic.
Additionally, in the U.S., we are working to bolster our customers' COVID-19 recovery by offering proven market-ready solutions, grounded in data insights and designed to help businesses nationwide reopen, rally and recover. As part of our ongoing commitment to local and national business owners, we are sharing these resources with marketers and media buyers via a new dynamic hub of solutions – “The COVID-19 Recovery Resource Center.” This online resource gives business owners and brand marketers access to curated solutions, including reports on COVID-influenced behavioral changes, strategic marketing and creative ideas to engage with consumers and tell brand stories in a post-pandemic environment, the latest research and case studies on our proven ability to drive in-store visits and impact consumer behavior even during a crisis, and access to our curated creative galleries that share how advertisers have responded to the crisis, providing proactive ideas for messaging and design. Moreover, these resources include an analysis of COVID-impacted changes to audience travel patterns and behaviors identified through RADAR. We will continue adding marketing and advertising resources to the Recovery Resource Center as the country continues to reopen, businesses rebuild, and new consumer insights become available through our robust ecosystem of partnerships and industry-leading technologies.
Implementation of Cost-Savings Initiatives and Targeted Liquidity Measures
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken and continue to take various measures to preserve and strengthen our financial flexibility, including contract renegotiations with landlords and municipalities to better align fixed site lease expenses with reductions in revenue; reductions in salaries, bonuses and employee hours; hiring freezes, furloughs and reductions in headcount; application for European governmental support and wage subsidies; reduction of certain discretionary expenses; and deferral of capital expenditures, site lease and other payments to optimize working capital levels. 
•In 2020, we recognized reductions of rent expense on lease and non-lease contracts due to negotiated rent abatements of $77.7 million. 
•We also received European governmental support and wage subsidies in response to COVID-19 of $15.6 million, which have been recorded as reductions in compensation and rent costs. 
During 2020, we also took certain targeted measures to increase our liquidity, including borrowing $150 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, amending our credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “Senior Secured Credit Agreement”) to suspend the springing financial covenant through June 2021 and delay the scheduled financial covenant step-down, and issuing $375 million aggregate principal amount of CCIBV Senior Secured Notes due 2025 through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary.

In September 2020, we committed to a restructuring plan for our international divisions to reduce headcount in Europe and Latin America. We commenced consultations with works councils, employee representatives, unions and other relevant organizations regarding the intended reduction in force and related cost reduction and restructuring actions. We initially expected to finalize the plans and make relevant announcements to employees on a country by country basis, with an expectation that the majority of all such announcements would be completed by the end of 2020. Due to the evolving nature of COVID-19 impacts and the complexity of executing such a plan, we did not complete the majority of the announcements in Europe by the end of 2020. We now expect to continue making employee announcements during 2021 and expect to substantially complete the plan by the first half of 2022. We previously disclosed an estimate of charges in the range of approximately $21 million to $24 million and annualized pre-tax cost savings of $20 million. As a result of the delay in the Europe portion of the plan, we are unable to estimate the total charges or anticipated cost savings with certainty at this time. The Latin America portion of the plan was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had incurred approximately $8.9 million in charges related to this restructuring plan. The restructuring charges primarily consist of one-time termination benefits, including severance and other associated costs.
In addition, during the second half of 2020, we incurred $3.2 million in charges pursuant to a separate plan to reduce headcount in our Americas segment, with expected annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $7 million. This plan was completed during the fourth quarter of 2020.
In conjunction with these plans, we incurred charges of $2.5 million related to Corporate operations. We expect annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $5 million with limited further charges related to Corporate operations, which we anticipate will be paid over the same time frame as the Europe portion of the international plan.
The duration and severity of COVID-19’s impacts continue to evolve and remain unknown. As such, we will consider expanding, refining or implementing further changes to our existing restructuring plans or implementing new restructuring plans to reduce headcount as circumstances warrant. Actual final charges pursuant to these plans may be materially different from our estimates, and there is no guarantee that we will achieve the cost savings that we expect.
Looking Forward
Although COVID-19 had significant adverse effects on our results for 2020, the trends that we saw during the year were at times encouraging. As audiences returned, our advertisers returned as well; however, it remains unclear when we will see stabilized out-of-home metrics translate into a return to typical out-of-home advertising buying levels and Company results. While we expect the near term to remain challenging, we believe that the underlying fundamentals of our industry and our business, the strength of our portfolio and the strategic steps we have taken to bolster our financial position will continue to support our long-term strategies. We expect to continue exploring opportunities to reduce costs while remaining focused on securing new business and building out our digital network as we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on improving trends. While we believe our distinct media offering, our continued investment in technology, and our strong customer relationships enable a stable path back to growth, the duration and severity of COVID-19’s impacts continue to evolve and remain unknown. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the possible impact of COVID-19 on our business.
Our Business Segments
    We have two reportable business segments: Americas, which includes operations primarily in the U.S., and Europe, which includes operations in Europe and Singapore. Our remaining operating segments – China, which we sold on April 28, 2020, and Latin America – do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments and are disclosed as “Other.” Americas, Europe and Other represented 53%, 43% and 4% of our 2020 revenue, respectively.
Americas
Overview
We are one of the largest out-of-home advertising companies in the U.S., with operations in 42 of the 50 largest U.S. markets, including all of the top 20 DMAs, and reaching more U.S. adults monthly in the top 10 DMAs than any other out-of-home media company. Our Americas segment generated 53%, 47% and 44% of our revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Table of Contents

Americas revenue, which is generated through both local and national sales channels, is derived from the sale of advertising copy placed on our printed and digital displays, consisting primarily of billboards, transit displays, street furniture, and spectaculars and wallscapes. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 71,000 advertising displays in the Americas. Our Americas business is focused on metropolitan areas with dense populations where our portfolio of assets provides advertisers with compelling opportunities to reach a mass audience in a cost-effective way, and the scale of our advertising networks enables us to deliver highly-targeted campaigns based on the specific audience delivered by individual panels. The majority of our Americas revenue is from large print and digital billboards, which are generally located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly-visible and heavily-trafficked. Our footprint is protected by significant barriers to entry for traditional large format roadside advertising, as well as the strong working relationships required with landlords and local governments. We seek to capitalize on our network, diversified product mix and long-standing presence in our existing markets to maximize revenue.
In 2020, the top five client categories in our Americas segment were business services, healthcare/medical, media, retail and banking/financial services. No single advertising market in the U.S. and no advertising category represented greater than 12% of our Americas revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Competition
The out-of-home advertising industry in the Americas is fragmented, consisting of several other large companies such as Outfront Media, Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company, as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets. Out-of-home advertising companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display. While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong customer relationships are also critical components of sales. We have long-standing relationships with a diversified group of advertising brands and agencies that allow us to diversify customer accounts and establish continuing revenue streams.
We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, mobile, social media, online and other forms of advertisement. According to data published by Magna Global in December 2020, out-of-home advertising accounts for approximately 4% of the advertising market in the U.S., excluding search advertising.
Sources of Revenue
The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each category for our Americas segment:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Billboards: | | | | | 
Bulletins | 65 | % | | 60 | % | 61 | %
Posters | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 11 | %
Transit displays | 14 | % | | 17 | % | 16 | %
Street furniture displays | 2 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Spectaculars/wallscapes | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Other(1) | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

(1)Includes production revenue and other non-advertising revenue.
Approximately 31%, 32% and 30% of our total Americas revenue during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was from digital displays.
Our advertising rates are based on a number of different factors, including location, competition, size of display, illumination, market and gross rating points (the total number of impressions delivered by a display or group of displays, expressed as a percentage of market population). The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by Geopath, an independent organization that provides audience measurement for the out-of-home industry in the U.S. using a range of dynamic data sources, including anonymous location and trip data from hundreds of millions of connected vehicles and smartphones, to understand the number of people passing a display during a defined period of time, along with insights into their demographic characteristics. The margins on our billboard contracts tend to be higher than those on contracts for other displays due to their greater size, impact and location along major roadways that are highly trafficked.
Table of Contents

Billboards. Our Americas billboard inventory primarily includes bulletins and posters and is available in both printed and digital formats. The terms of our customer contracts for these displays generally range from four weeks to one year. Because of their greater size and impact, we typically receive higher rates for bulletins than we do for posters.
•Bulletins, which are most commonly 14 feet high by 48 feet wide, are generally located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our customers may contract for individual bulletins or a network of bulletins, meaning their advertisements are rotated within the network to increase the reach of the campaign.
•Posters can vary in size but are commonly approximately 11 feet high by 23 feet wide, and junior posters are approximately 5 feet high by 11 feet wide. Posters are generally located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater demographic targeting than those displayed on bulletins.
•Premiere displays, which use one or more poster panels but with vinyl advertising stretched over the panels similar to bulletins, are innovative hybrids between bulletins and posters that we developed to provide our customers with an alternative for their targeted marketing campaigns, combining the creative impact of bulletins with the additional reach and frequency of posters.
    Transit Displays. Our Americas transit displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, are advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams, and within the common areas of rail stations and airports. The terms of our customer contracts for these displays generally range from four weeks to one year, although some are longer. 
    Street Furniture Displays. Our Americas street furniture displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, include advertising surfaces on bus shelters, information kiosks, freestanding units and other public structures and are primarily located in major metropolitan areas and along major commuting routes. We are generally responsible for the construction and maintenance of street furniture structures, and we typically sell advertising on our street furniture displays as part of a network package that includes multiple street furniture displays. The terms of our customer contracts for these displays generally range from four weeks to one year.
    Spectaculars and Wallscapes. Spectaculars are customized display structures that often incorporate video, multi-dimensional lettering and figures, mechanical devices, moving parts and other embellishments to create special effects. Customer contracts for these displays, which are located in New York City's Times Square, typically have terms of at least one year. A wallscape is a display that drapes over or is suspended from the sides of buildings or other structures and is generally located in high-profile areas where other types of out-of-home advertising displays are limited or unavailable. The majority of our wallscapes are located in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City’s Times Square, and the terms of our customer contracts for these displays typically range from four weeks to one year.
Other Revenue. In the majority of our markets, our local production staff can perform the full range of activities required to create and/or install advertising copy, including creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing, and installing the copy on displays. The remainder of the revenue from our Americas segment consists primarily of fees related to these activities, including vinyl or poster orders, production, embellishments and installation services.
Digital. Digital advertising allows for high-frequency, 24-hour advertising changes in high-traffic locations, enabling us to offer our clients optimal flexibility, distribution, circulation and visibility. Our scale has enabled cost-effective investment in new display technologies, such as digital billboards and smaller format LCD screens. The dynamic nature of digital displays allows us to sell more advertising opportunities to advertisers, optimizing yield on a per structure basis. We deployed 74 new digital billboards during 2020, for a total of more than 1,400 digital billboards as of December 31, 2020. Our Americas segment had more than 2,000 digital billboards and street furniture displays as of December 31, 2020.
Operations
We typically own the physical structures on which our customers’ advertising copy is displayed. We manage the construction of our structures centrally and erect them on sites we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements or executed long-term management agreements. The site lease terms generally range from 1 to 20 years. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. No one property is material to our overall operations.
The majority of the advertising structures on which our displays are mounted require permits, which are granted for the right to operate an advertising structure as long as the structure is used in compliance with state and local laws and regulations. Permits are typically granted in perpetuity by the state and/or local government and typically are transferable or renewable for a minimal, or no, fee.

Our rights to place transit displays on vehicles, within transit systems, or within the common areas of rail stations and airports and to place street furniture displays in the public domain, as well as the rights to sell advertising on such displays, are governed by contracts awarded by municipal and public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law or, in the case of transit displays, may be negotiated with private transit operators. As compensation for the right to sell advertising space on these displays, we pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the displays, and we are typically required to pay minimum guaranteed amounts. These contracts generally have terms ranging from 5 to 10 years for transit displays and 10 to 20 years for street furniture displays.
Printed advertising copy is primarily printed with computer-generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl or polyethylene material supplied by the advertiser. These prints are then transported to the display site and secured to the display surface, either by being wrapped around the face of the site or affixed to a hardware anchoring system on the display site. Digital displays are linked through centralized computer systems to simultaneously and rapidly change advertising copy on a large number of displays as needed. Our operational process also includes conducting visual inspections of our inventory for display defects and taking necessary corrective action within a reasonable period of time.
Sales and Marketing
    We are redefining how outdoor media is bought and sold, working closely with customers, advertising agencies and other diversified media companies to develop more sophisticated approaches to delivering the right audience in the right location at the right time. One example is our programmatic effort to sell digital billboard advertisements using automated advertisement sales technology to introduce ease and efficiency to the out-of-home advertising sales process and enable better targeting of digital billboard advertising. Another example is our Proposal Team, which provides proposal preparation and marketing support for our key multi-market sales efforts. A third area is our proof-of-performance delivery platform that is leading the industry in providing transparency when the ad is delivered, accessible via an application programming interface to allow partners to pull proof-of-performance information into whichever system they choose. Additionally, in light of the effects of COVID-19, we have expanded our client-direct selling initiatives with a focus on selling creative ideas as opposed to specific billboard locations as advertisers work to realign their advertising campaigns.
RADAR
    RADAR is the industry’s first suite of campaign planning, attribution and amplification solutions, designed to utilize anonymous, aggregated mobile location data to help brands reach certain audiences and understand what happens after someone is exposed to an out-of-home advertisement. The individual tools within the suite are as follows:
•RADARView® is our campaign planning and visualization tool, which combines several data sources, including industry standard audience measurement and anonymized, privacy-compliant location data from tens of millions of mobile devices, enabling advertisers to optimize their campaigns to most efficiently reach specific audience segments; 
•RADARProof® is our attribution measurement tool, which uses anonymized and aggregated data to understand the behavior of groups of people after they've been exposed to specific campaign ads. The behavior of these "exposed audiences" is compared to a control group of people who have not seen the campaign ads, enabling us to demonstrate to advertisers the impact of their campaigns on a variety of business objectives, including product purchases, store visits, application downloads, TV tune-in, brand awareness, purchase intent and more;
•RADARConnect® amplifies out-of-home campaigns by re-targeting exposed audience groups with mobile ads, providing clients with a simple, easy-to-activate advertising solution that both extends reach and drives further impact of their out-of-home advertising campaigns; and 
•RADARSync® facilitates data integration by letting advertisers leverage the benefits of the RADAR tools using their preferred data, while also facilitating the ingestion of RADAR out-of-home campaign performance data into media agencies’ and advertisers’ own multi-touch attribution models, allowing the value of out-of-home to be understood as an integrated element of today's predominantly digital-led advertising and marketing programs.
We continue to make enhancements and expand the RADAR suite. We have also adapted the RADAR offering in Europe, including supplier selection processes and methods, in order to comply with data privacy laws including the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and we ensure our data partners undergo a data privacy impact assessment process. We believe analytics will play a critical role in helping brands particularly in their COVID-19 recovery, and we continue to demonstrate for advertisers how our RADAR suite of solutions can assist.

Europe
Overview
Our Europe segment spans 17 countries in seven regions: France, the U.K., the Nordics (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Central Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland), Southern Europe (Italy and Spain), other European countries (Ireland, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia) and Singapore. We are the largest out-of-home advertising provider in several of these countries and consistently rank as a top out-of-home player in all of our European locations. Our Europe segment generated 43%, 41% and 43% of our revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our Europe revenue is generated from the sale of advertising space on street furniture displays, billboards, transit displays and retail displays, and the majority of our customers are advertisers targeting national or regional audiences whose business generally is placed with us through media or advertising agencies. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio included approximately 430,000 displays. (Our Europe display count includes display faces, which may include multiple faces on a single structure, as well as small individual displays. As a result, our Europe display count is not comparable to our Americas display count, which includes only unique displays.)
Our Europe portfolio is focused on densely populated metropolitan areas and spans many of Europe’s major cities, including London, Paris, Madrid and Rome, as well as Singapore. Similar to our Americas business, we believe our Europe business has attractive industry fundamentals, including the ability to reach a broad audience and drive foot traffic to the point-of-sale, making out-of-home advertising a cost-effective medium for advertisers compared to other traditional media, as measured by cost per thousand persons reached. Europe out-of-home advertising is an urban medium, and street furniture displays are our largest source of advertising revenue. Located at the heart of cities and close to the point-of-sale, street furniture displays have a location advantage, which advertisers leverage to drive foot traffic to their retail locations and influence purchase decisions.
In 2020, the top five client categories in our Europe segment were retail, food/food products, entertainment, automotive and telecommunications. No advertising category represented greater than 15% of our Europe revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Competition
    The out-of-home advertising industry in Europe is highly competitive, consisting of several other large companies such as JCDecaux SA and Global Media & Entertainment, as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets. Out-of-home advertising companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display. While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong client relationships are also critical components of sales. Our entrepreneurial business model allows local management to operate their markets as separate profit centers, encouraging customer cultivation and service.
    We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, online, mobile and other forms of advertisement. According to data published by Magna Global in December 2020, out-of-home advertising accounts for approximately 6% of the advertising market in Western Europe, excluding search advertising, with out-of-home advertising’s share of the advertising market varying by country based on a number of factors, including regulation, sophistication, sociocultural aspects and historic media buying trends.
Sources of Revenue
The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each category for our Europe segment:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018
Street furniture displays | 49% | 45% | 42% 
Billboards | 19% | 19% | 20% 
Transit displays | 8% | 12% | 14% 
Retail displays | 14% | 14% | 13% 
Other(1) | 10% | 10% | 11% 
Total | 100% | 100% | 100%

(1)Includes advertising revenue from small displays and non-advertising revenue from sales of street furniture equipment, cleaning and maintenance services, operation of public bike programs and production revenue.
    Approximately 31%, 29% and 26% of our total Europe revenue during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was from digital displays.
Table of Contents

    Similar to our Americas business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. In some of the countries where we have operations, the number of impressions delivered by a display is weighted to account for such factors as illumination, proximity to other displays, and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic.
Street Furniture Displays. Our Europe street furniture displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, include advertising surfaces on bus shelters, freestanding units, various types of kiosks, telephone boxes and other public structures. Our print street furniture is typically sold to customers as network packages of multiple street furniture displays, with contract terms ranging from one to two weeks.
    Billboards. The sizes of our Europe billboards are not standardized. The billboards vary in size across our networks, with the majority of our Europe billboards being similar in size to the posters used in our Americas business. Our Europe billboard inventory is primarily comprised of premium and classic billboards and is available in both printed and digital formats. They are primarily sold to clients as network packages with contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks, although long-term customer contracts with terms of up to one year are also available. 
•Premium billboards, which are typically larger in format, generally are located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked, as well as being located in iconic city center locations. Our customers may contract for individual billboards or a network of billboards. Because of their greater size and impact, as well as the high frequency and 24-hour advertising changes, we typically receive our highest rates for digital premium billboards. Not all of our premium billboards are digitized due to a number of factors such as regulatory consents or commercial considerations.
•Classic billboards are available in a variety of formats across our Europe markets and generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater breadth of demographic targeting than those displayed on premium billboards. Classic billboards typically deliver lower rates than our premium billboards.
    Transit Displays. Our Europe transit displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, consist of advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams and within the common areas of rail stations and airports. The terms of our customer contracts for these displays generally range from one week to one year, although some are longer.
    Retail Displays. Our retail displays, which are available in both printed and digital formats, are mainly standalone advertising structures in or in close proximity to retail outlets such as malls and supermarkets. The terms of our customer contracts for these displays generally range from one to two weeks.
Other Revenue. The remainder of the revenue from our Europe segment consists primarily of advertising revenue from other small displays, production revenue, and non-advertising revenue from the following sources:
•Sales of street furniture equipment and cleaning and maintenance services. In several of our European markets, we sell equipment or provide cleaning and maintenance services as part of street furniture contracts with municipalities.
•Operation of public bike programs. We also have a public bicycle rental program which provides bicycles for rent to the general public in several municipalities. In exchange for operating these bike rental programs, we generally derive revenue from advertising rights to the bikes, bike stations, additional street furniture displays and/or a share of rental income from the local municipalities.
Digital. Our digital network is a dynamic medium, which enables our customers to engage in real-time, tactical, topical and flexible advertising. Our scale has enabled cost-effective investment in digital display technology, and we continued to expand our digital footprint this year, adding 1,244 digital displays in 2020 for a total of more than 16,000 digital displays as of December 31, 2020. Through our digital brands, including Clear Channel Play and Adshel Live, we are able to offer networks of digital displays in multiple formats and environments including bus shelters, billboards, airports, transit, malls and flagship locations. As we continue to expand our digital reach across European cities, we are well-positioned to deliver increased flexibility and enhanced contextual relevance, at scale, improving our ability to meet brands’ needs.
Operations
We generally build our portfolios of advertising locations by entering into medium to long-term contracts with landlords such as municipalities, private individuals and shopping malls. Upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs vary across contracts.

•Our rights to place street furniture in the public domain and to sell advertising on such street furniture are governed by contracts awarded by municipal and transit authorities, which typically provide for terms ranging up to 15 years. The major difference between our Europe and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts. In Europe, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities such as bus shelters with or without advertising panels, information kiosks and public wastebaskets, as well as space for the municipality to display maps or other public information. In exchange for providing such metropolitan amenities and display space, we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. We pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the displays and are typically required to pay minimum guaranteed amounts. 
•We lease the majority of our billboard sites from private landowners, usually for one to ten years. 
•Similar to street furniture, our rights to place transit displays on vehicles or within transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes or are negotiated with private transit operators. These contracts generally have terms ranging from two to five years.
•Our rights to place displays in retail locations and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by retail outlet operators such as large retailers or mall operators, either through private tenders or bilateral negotiations. These contracts generally have terms ranging from three to ten years.
We generally outsource the manufacturing of advertising structures to third parties and regularly seek competitive bids. We use a wide range of suppliers located in many of our markets, although much of our inventory is manufactured in China and the U.K. We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations. No one property is significant to our overall operations.
•The design of street furniture structures (such as bus shelters, bicycle racks and kiosks) is typically done in conjunction with a third-party supplier, and our street furniture sites are posted by our own employees or subcontractors who also clean and maintain the sites. The decision to use our own employees or subcontractors is made on a market-by-market basis taking into consideration the mix of products in the market and local labor costs. 
•Digital displays generally use LCD or LED technology. The manufacture and installation process is generally the same as for traditional sites; however, specialist suppliers are used to supply the LED tiles or LCD screen displays, and there may be additional factors, such as electrical supply and network connectivity, involved during design and construction.
Media or advertising agencies often provide our customers creative services to design and produce advertising copy, which is delivered to us either in digital format or in the traditional format of physical printed advertisements. For digital advertising campaigns, the digital advertisement is received by our content management system and is then distributed to our digital displays, which are linked through centralized computer systems to simultaneously and rapidly change messages throughout the course of a day. For traditional advertising campaigns, the printed advertisement – whether in paper or vinyl – is shipped to centralized warehouses operated by us or third parties. The copy is then sorted and delivered to sites where it is installed on our displays.
Sales and Marketing
We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competition based on our sophisticated sales approach, emphasis on innovation and strong client relationships. In addition to our core focus of building relationships with our advertising customers and their agencies, a key focus is to continue to develop sophisticated pricing, packaging and programmatic selling tools and techniques – in particular pricing and packaging models that leverage the capabilities and benefits of digital display networks. Expanding our proprietary programmatic platform, which enables marketers to buy our out-of-home inventory in audience-based packages, gives customers the ability to manage their campaigns on a self-service basis. We are developing our programmatic capabilities throughout Europe, while securing and expanding partnerships with a number of leading platform partners.
Technologies and Tools
Through our digital transformation, we are committed to making our inventory more accessible to both new and existing advertisers. Additionally, we seek to achieve greater consumer engagement by delivering powerful, flexible and interactive campaigns that open up new possibilities for advertisers to engage with their target audiences. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the diversification of our product offering by introducing technologies, such as beacons, small cells, way-finding stations and provision of Wi-Fi, in our street furniture network as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients’ advertisements. We also work closely with municipalities to develop smart city products, including interactive digital mapping solutions, information kiosks and Wi-Fi hubs, which also provide additional advertising opportunities.

We are also continuing to focus on employing data and technology in order to enhance our revenue and campaign management tools and, in particular, to help brands navigate the audience and environmental impacts of changing COVID-19 restrictions. In 2020, we launched a GDPR-adapted version of RADAR in the U.K. and Spain, which has further strengthened our ability to help brands engage audiences effectively as mobility patterns evolve. We also launched the Return Audience Hub in the U.K., which has become a go-to planning portal for advertisers. The Hub monitors a large anonymized mobile dataset to learn and openly share how the portfolio is delivering audiences compared to pre-lockdown levels, demonstrating how mobility behaviors have adapted, and provides simple off-the-shelf solutions that help advertisers utilize audience ‘hot spots.’ 
Other
Latin America
In addition to our Americas and Europe segments, we also have operations in Latin America, including in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru. Our Latin America business generated 2%, 3% and 3% of our revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The majority of our Latin America revenue is generated from the sale of advertising space on billboards and street furniture displays. As of December 31, 2020, our Latin American portfolio included approximately 5,500 displays, including more than 700 digital displays. In addition, we generate revenue from public bicycle rental programs, which operate in a similar manner to our public bicycle rental programs in Europe.
China
On April 28, 2020, we sold our 50.91% stake in Clear Media, a company based in China whose ordinary shares are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Our stake in Clear Media generated 2%, 8% and 10% of our revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our Human Capital Resources
    Our mission is to connect brands and consumers by delivering innovative advertising insights and solutions while enhancing our communities. We believe that our continued success and position as an industry leader is dependent upon successful execution of this mission, and a critical component in achieving this mission is attracting, motivating and retaining great people who allow us to continue to find new and innovative ways to serve our customers and our communities.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 4,800 employees, including approximately 1,500 employees in the U.S., approximately 2,900 employees in Europe and approximately 400 employees in Latin America. Of our total employees, approximately 4,100 were in direct operations and approximately 700 were in administrative or corporate-related activities. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
We have a continual focus on talent management in our organization with an annual talent identification process and development programs in place to ensure we have sufficient succession planning strategies for critical roles. Additionally, we have a robust annual goal-setting and performance management process, in line with our global strategy of ensuring that all employees have a connection and purpose aligned to our overall company goals. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to create strong teams and vibrant culture at every level of our organization through our core values of integrity, innovation, excellence and safety. We also strive to offer a fair and competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do their best work, provide a safe workplace, and give employees the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social impact. We believe people can achieve their full potential when they enjoy their work, so it is our priority to provide a workplace where growth, success and fun go hand in hand. We formally survey our employees on a periodic and ongoing basis to measure engagement and identify areas for improvement.
COVID-19 has affected everyone worldwide and, as a global company bolstered by a diverse workforce, our priority is to protect the safety, health and well-being of our employees and their families. In recognition of the unique challenges facing our people around the world during this time, in May we launched Our People Pledge in order to reaffirm and emphasize our commitment to putting our people first, as well as to guide and support our people through this challenging period. Our People Pledge, which is consistent with the Company’s foundational core values, identifies five core commitments to which we hold our Company and our employees accountable — recognizing the importance of the global Clear Channel community, being fair and transparent in our decision-making approach to our people, being flexible and open to new ideas, partnering with our customers and communities, and looking towards the future. We believe that in doing so, we’ll emerge from this period of uncertainty as a stronger global Clear Channel community.

Code of Business Conduct
We are deeply committed to promoting a culture of ethical conduct and compliance. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all employees as well as officers and all members of the Board, reinforces our core values and helps drive our workplace culture of compliance with ethical standards, integrity and accountability. Training on the Code is mandatory upon employment and is provided on an annual basis. Highlights from our Code include a no-retaliation policy for anyone who, acting in good faith, notifies us of a possible violation of the Code, our policies or the law; a commitment to human rights and labor protections in all of our operations, and the expectation that our business partners uphold the same standards; and an anti-corruption policy that prohibits offering, attempting to offer, authorizing or promising any bribe or kickback for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an unfair advantage.
Compensation and Benefits Programs
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary and annual incentive bonuses tied to Company and division performance, in line with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Our sales employees are incentivized through sales commission programs, with our highest performing individuals further awarded through formal recognition programs. Our executives and certain other employees receive long-term equity awards that vest based on our relative total shareholder return or over a defined period. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests.
We also provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of healthcare and insurance benefits, qualified spending accounts, retirement savings plans and various other benefits.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. We respect and embrace diversity of thought and experience and believe that a diverse workforce produces more innovative insights and solutions, resulting in better products and services for our customers. As we bring brands face-to-face with people, we believe our teams need to be as diverse in their composition and outlook as the audiences we reach every day, and we work together to create an inclusive environment where everyone can bring their true selves to work.
We have an ongoing priority to enhance diversity of our workforce and have implemented diversity and inclusion strategies across our global business. Amidst calls for sociopolitical change we’ve seen play out in all corners of the world, we have reinforced our commitment to our people and to promoting diversity and inclusion, as well as the need to do more to continue improving and evolving as an organization. In an effort to further promote a diverse and inclusive environment, we have launched the Executive Diversity Advisory Council in the U.S., implemented the International Fairness program in Europe, and surveyed employees globally to gather insights on diversity and inclusion preferences to help guide and prioritize our efforts.
Safety and Wellness
Safety is one of our core values, and we are committed to providing our employees with a safe workplace and prioritizing the physical and mental health and well-being of our employees. One of the ways in which we do this is by offering an Employee Assistance Program, which gives employees access to licensed professional counselors and other specialists at no cost for help with balancing work and life issues. We have also implemented an Employee Relief Fund to help employees facing financial hardship immediately after a disaster or during unanticipated and unavoidable personal emergencies. 
In response to COVID-19, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate and which comply with government regulations. This included transitioning the vast majority of our employees to work-from-home for a large portion of 2020, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. In recent months, we have started to execute on our phased Return-to-Office plan on an office-by-office basis, ensuring compliance with state and local regulations as well as guidance issued by the CDC. As part of this plan, we have implemented a number of strict safety procedures and protocols, including mandatory trainings, social distancing and rotational schedules, daily screening questionnaires and temperature checks, mandatory use of masks in common areas and enhanced cleaning protocols. Given the uncertainty and evolving-nature of COVID-19 developments, our Return-to-Office plan is nimble, allowing each office the flexibility to return to work-from-home directives as necessary based on local conditions.
Table of Contents

In line with our priority of protecting the safety, health and well-being of our employees, we surveyed our employees in May 2020 to determine how we could more effectively provide support. This survey, administered by a third party, focused on the following areas: concern and connection; virtual work effectiveness; senior leadership response and communication; and employee wellness, health and safety. Utilizing the results of this survey, we developed an action plan to face the challenges of COVID-19 while helping employees remain engaged and productive with regular communication of our progress through all-hands meetings, regional and departmental meetings and other forms of communication.
Community Involvement
One of our guiding principles is making a difference in the communities we serve, and our corporate social responsibility initiatives are an important part of our culture. We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. As a company, we endeavor to use our resources and products to drive meaningful societal change and have collaborated with local and national organizations globally to improve health and public safety; to ensure a sustainable environment; to promote arts, education and cultural diversity; and to support market-by-market advertising standards. We also provide employees the opportunity to give back through our Local Spirit Day of Service program, which offers employees a day of paid volunteer time each year.
Regulation of our Business
Regulations have a significant impact on the out-of-home advertising industry and our business. As the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities, we must comply with various environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and zoning restrictions. Historically, we have not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws.
The out-of-home advertising industry in the U.S. is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act (“HBA”), regulates out-of-home advertising on Federal-Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads within the U.S. (“controlled roads”). The HBA regulates the size and placement of billboards, requires the development of state standards, mandates state compliance programs, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs, and requires just compensation if a state or other government agency or entity compels the removal of a lawful billboard along a controlled road. To satisfy the HBA’s requirements, all states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations that regulate, among other things, construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, height, size, spacing, placement and permitting of out-of-home advertising structures. We are not aware of any state that has passed control statutes and regulations less restrictive than the prevailing federal requirements on the federal highway system, including the requirement that an owner remove any non-grandfathered, non-compliant signs along the controlled roads at the owner’s expense and without compensation. In the past, state governments have purchased and removed existing lawful billboards for beautification purposes using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and these jurisdictions may continue to do so in the future. Local governments generally also include billboard control as part of their zoning laws and building codes, regulating those items described above, and include similar provisions regarding the removal of non-grandfathered structures that do not comply with certain of the local requirements. Some local governments have initiated code enforcement and permit reviews of billboards within their jurisdiction, and, in some instances, we have had to remove billboards as a result of such reviews. As part of their billboard control laws, state and local governments also regulate the construction of new signs. Some jurisdictions prohibit new construction, some jurisdictions allow new construction only to replace or relocate existing structures, and some jurisdictions allow new construction subject to the various restrictions discussed above. In certain jurisdictions, restrictive regulations also limit our ability to relocate, rebuild, repair, maintain, upgrade, modify or replace existing legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations).
From time to time, state and local government authorities use the power of eminent domain and amortization to remove billboards. Amortization is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation has been earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. Thus far, we have been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for, or relocation of, our billboards purchased or removed as a result of these types of governmental action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future.

Each of the international countries in which we operate has its own regulatory regime and, in some cases, more than one regulatory regime. International regulation of the out-of-home advertising industry varies by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. In addition, many of these regulations set specific guidelines for the development of new out-of-home locations and address the construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing, location and permitting of billboards as well as the use of new technologies for changing displays, such as digital displays. Other regulations may limit the subject matter and language of out-of-home displays. For example, most European Union (“E.U.”) countries, among other nations, have banned out-of-home advertisements for tobacco products and regulate alcohol advertising.
We have introduced and intend to expand the global deployment of digital billboards, which display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that changes up to several times per minute. We have encountered some existing regulations in the U.S. and across some international jurisdictions that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays. However, since digital technology for changing static copy has only recently been developed and introduced into the market on a large scale, existing regulations that currently do not apply to digital technology by their terms could be revised to impose greater restrictions. These regulations, or actions by third parties, may impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety.
From time to time, legislation has been introduced in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from out-of-home advertising, for the right to use out-of-home advertising assets, or for the privilege of engaging in the out-of-home advertising business. Several jurisdictions have imposed such taxes as a percentage of our out-of-home advertising revenue generated in that jurisdiction or based on the size of the billboard and type of display technology. In addition, some jurisdictions have taxed our personal property and leasehold interests in advertising locations using various valuation methodologies. We expect U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to continue to try to impose such taxes as a way of increasing revenue.
These laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in our markets in a variety of ways. Such laws may reduce our expansion opportunities or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from other members of the out-of-home advertising industry. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations, and the enforcement thereof, will not materially and adversely affect the out-of-home advertising industry. However, we contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our out-of-home advertising business.
Privacy and Data Protection
We obtain certain types of information from users of our technology platforms, including our websites, web pages, interactive features, social media pages and mobile applications (collectively, “Platforms”) in accordance with cookie regulation and our terms of use, with applicable Privacy Notices posted on each Platform. We obtain anonymous and aggregated audience behavior insights about consumers from vetted third-party data providers who are contractually obligated to ensure that any personal information collected is only from consenting consumers and is compliant with applicable laws. We use and share this information for a variety of business purposes and may coordinate out-of-home client campaigns with online advertising campaigns run by our business partners, including interstitial ads and push notifications. In addition, we collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) from our employees, users of our public bike services, our business partners and consumers who interact with our digital panels, including through QR codes and beacon technology, as set out in relevant Privacy Notices.
We are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or limit the services we are able to offer. In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states in the U.S. and most other countries require companies to implement specific information security controls and legal protections to protect certain types of PII. Likewise, most states in the U.S. and most other countries have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their PII. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.

In the U.S., we regularly review and implement commercially reasonable organizational and technical security measures that are designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of our employees’, customers’ and consumers’ PII and to protect our proprietary business information. In late 2020, the state of California adopted the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative, which expands and modifies the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) to more closely resemble the E.U.’s GDPR. The CPRA creates a broader set of consumer privacy rights and business obligations than the CCPA, including additional notice and consent obligations relevant to employee data and digital advertising. We will be able to leverage many aspects of our existing privacy compliance efforts to adapt to these regulatory changes, which will go into full effect in 2023. We expect to incur additional compliance costs in doing so and recognize that the government may impose new data collection restrictions on us and on our business partners conforming with other global restrictions. Beyond California, a growing number of other U.S. states are proposing new privacy legislation, which has created the need for multi-state compliance. We continue to monitor and adapt to this evolving privacy landscape.
Internationally, we have implemented a comprehensive legal and information security-led approach to compliance with legislation, including the E.U.-wide GDPR, the E.U. Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation, the U.K. Data Protection Act, the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law, in line with our obligations and risk profile. Our Chief Data Privacy Officer runs our European and Latin American Privacy Office, which includes a newly appointed European Data Privacy Officer following the Brexit Agreement between the U.K. and Europe in December 2020 and a new Brazilian Data Privacy Officer. Our Privacy Office has particular focus on assessing and controlling the privacy impact of our audience behavioral measurement tools, which are the subject of occasional European media focus and may be capable of being misunderstood. We are also in the process of adapting our data transfer mechanisms to adapt to significant E.U. privacy case law seeking to further control U.S. transfers of E.U. personal data.
Despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Any failure or perceived failure by us to protect our information or information about our employees, customers and consumers, or to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements, could result in damage to our business and loss of confidence in us; damage to our brands; the loss of users of our services, consumers, business partners and advertisers; and proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business.
