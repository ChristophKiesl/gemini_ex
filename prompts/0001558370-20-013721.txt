Primary Operating Divisions and Facilities and Industry Segments
​
Chase Corporation (the “Company,” “Chase,” “we,” or “us”), a global specialty chemicals company founded in 1946, is a leading manufacturer of protective materials for high-reliability applications across diverse market sectors. Our strategy is to maximize the performance of our core businesses and brands while seeking future opportunities through strategic acquisitions. Through investments in facilities, systems and organizational consolidation we seek to improve performance and gain economies of scale. 
In the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019 (the prior year), we reorganized from two into three reportable operating segments: an Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment, an Industrial Tapes segment and a Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. The segments are distinguished by the nature of the products manufactured and how they are delivered to their respective markets. The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment (whose operations were formerly included within the Industrial Materials segment) offers innovative and specialized product offerings consisting of both end-use products and intermediates that are used in, or integrated into, another company’s products. Demand for the segment’s product offerings is typically dependent upon general economic conditions. This segment leverages the core specialty chemical competencies of the Company, and serves diverse markets and applications. The segment sells predominantly into the transportation, appliance, medical, general industrial and environmental market verticals. The Industrial Tapes segment (whose operations were formerly included within the Industrial Materials segment) features legacy wire and cable materials, specialty tapes, and other laminated and coated products. The segment derives its competitive advantage through its proven chemistries, diverse specialty offerings and the reliability its supply chain offers to end customers. These products are generally used in the assembly of other manufacturers’ products, with demand typically dependent upon general economic conditions. This segment sells mostly to established markets, with some exposure to growth opportunities through further development of existing products. Markets served include cable manufacturing, utilities and telecommunications, and electronics packaging. The Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment (formerly known as the Construction Materials segment) is principally composed of project-oriented product offerings that are primarily sold and used as “Chase” branded products. End markets include new and existing infrastructure projects on oil, gas, water and wastewater pipelines, highways and bridge decks, water and wastewater containment systems, and commercial buildings. The segment’s products include protective coatings for pipeline applications, coating and lining systems for waterproofing and liquid storage applications, adhesives and sealants used in architectural and building envelope waterproofing applications, high-performance polymeric asphalt additives, and expansion joint systems for waterproofing applications in transportation and architectural markets. With sales generally dependent on outdoor project work, the segment experiences highly seasonal sales patterns. Our manufacturing facilities are distinct to their respective segments apart from our O’Hara Township, PA, Blawnox, PA and Hickory, NC facilities, which produce products related to a combination of operating segments.

The Company’s second quarter of fiscal 2020 saw the beginning of the global spread of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which subsequently grew to create significant volatility, uncertainty, and global economic disruption. During the third fiscal quarter, the Company implemented changes to its cost structure designed to address market changes brought on by COVID-19 and demonstrate its commitment to fiscal prudence: (a) the Company made a targeted reduction in its global workforce, contemplated pre-pandemic but catalyzed by COVID-19, which resulted in the recognition of $183,000 in severance costs during the period; and (b) the Company also instituted a temporary 20% reduction in the base salaries of its named executive officers and select members of senior management, as well as the cash compensation of the non-employee members of its Board of Directors. The reduction in force, which impacted operations in the Company’s U.S. facilities, and the adjustments in compensation were both effective May 2020. 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Chase began moving the pulling and detection operations housed in its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC facility. This is in line with the Company’s ongoing initiative to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its existing processes. At the time, the pulling and detection operations were the only Chase-owned production operations in Granite Falls, NC, with the remaining portions of the building being either utilized for research and development or leased to a third party. The process of moving, including moving internal research and development capabilities, was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company recognized $559,000 in expense related to the move in the six-month period ended February 29, 2020, having recognized $526,000 in expense during the second half of fiscal 2019. No costs were recognized in the six months ended August 31, 2020, and future costs related to this move are not anticipated to be significant to the consolidated financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 (prior year), Chase commissioned engineering studies of certain legacy operations, machinery and locations related to the Company’s ongoing facility rationalization and consolidation initiative. Chase completed its review of the data and recommendations provided by the study in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 (current year). Following the review, the Company wrote down the value of certain non-operating production assets related to the pipeline coatings product line, within the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. Given the nature and prospects of the equipment, the Company determined its then carrying value exceeded its fair value and recognized an expense of $405,000 to write-down the value. Given the ongoing nature of the facility rationalization and consolidation initiative, an estimate of future costs cannot currently be determined.

​
Human Capital Resources
​
As of October 31, 2020, we employed approximately 619 people (including union employees). 80% are U.S. based and 20% international. 29% of our employees work in administrative, selling and research and development functions, while 71% work in the manufacture of our products at our facilities. We consider our employee relations to be good. In the U.S., we offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive relative to others in our industry. In our operations outside the U.S., we offer benefits that may vary from those offered to our U.S. employees due to customary local practices and statutory requirements.

Backlog, Customers and Competition
​
As of October 31, 2020, the backlog of customer orders believed to be firm was approximately $15,949,000.  This compared with a backlog of $17,930,000 as of October 31, 2019. The decrease in backlog from the prior year amount is believed to be primarily due to changes in customers’ ordering patterns in the current COVID-19 environment. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of sales. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination of profits or contracts at the election of the United States Federal Government.
​
There are other companies that manufacture or sell products and services similar to those made and sold by us.  Many of those companies are larger and have greater financial resources than we have. We compete principally on the basis of technical performance, service reliability, quality and price. 
​
