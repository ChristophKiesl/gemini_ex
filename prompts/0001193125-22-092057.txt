ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Introduction 
 CCAC was a blank check company incorporated on September 9, 2019 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. CCAC neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue. Based on CCACs business activities, CCAC was a shell company as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) because CCAC had no operations and assets consisting almost entirely of cash. 
 On February 13, 2020, CCAC consummated its initial public offering (IPO) of 27,600,000 units (the Units), including the issuance of 3,600,000 Units as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share of CCAC, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class A Ordinary Shares), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of CCAC (each whole warrant, a Warrant), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to CCAC of $276,000,000. 
 On November 14, 2019, the Sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share, to cover certain offering costs in consideration for 6,900,000 Class B ordinary shares of CCAC, par value $0.0001 (the Founder Shares). On December 10, 2019, the Sponsor transferred 718,750 Founder Shares to Henri Arif, CCACs independent director, for a purchase price of $3,125 (the same per-share price initially paid by the Sponsor), resulting in the Sponsor holding 5,031,250 Founder Shares. On February 10, 2020, CCAC effected a share capitalization of 1,150,000 Class B ordinary shares and as a result the Sponsor held 6,037,500 founder shares and Mr. Arif held 862,500 founder shares. As of December 31, 2021, the Sponsor held 6,015,500 Founder Shares. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, CCAC completed the private sale of 7,520,000 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to CCAC of $7,520,000. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants included as part of the Units sold in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by CCAC, (ii) could not (including the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of CCACs initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised on a cashless basis and (iv) are entitled to registration rights. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 A total of $276,000,000, comprised of $270,480,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $9,660,000 of the underwriters deferred discount) and $5,520,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the Trust Account) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to CCAC to pay its taxes and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, the funds held in the Trust Account were not to be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of CCACs initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the Class A Ordinary Shares included in the Units sold in the IPO (the public shares) properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend CCACs Amended Charter (A) to modify the substance or timing of CCACs obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if it does not complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) the redemption of CCACs public shares if it is unable to complete its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law. 
 After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately $521,000 in expenses relating to the Public Offering, approximately $1,000,000 of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was retained by CCAC for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2021 there was $277,873,665 in investments and cash held in the Trust Account and $31,344 of cash held outside the Trust Account available for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2021, none of the funds had been withdrawn from the Trust Account to fund CCACs working capital expenses. 
 On February 8, 2022, CCAC consummated the previously announced merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, by and among CCAC, Merger Sub and Legacy Quanergy. On January 28, 2022, Legacy Quanergy changed its corporate name to Quanergy Perception Technologies, Inc. CCACs shareholders approved the Business Combination and the change of CCACs jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware by deregistering as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and

  domesticating and continuing as a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware an extraordinary general meeting of stockholders held on January 31, 2022. In connection with the Business Combination, holders of 26,867,796 of CCACs Class A Ordinary Shares, or approximately 97.3% of the shares with redemption rights, exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.07 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $270,503,771. On February 8, 2022, holders of 600,000 of CCACs Class A Ordinary Shares, or approximately 2.2% of the shares with redemption rights, reversed their prior redemptions, resulting in $6,040,773 being returned to the Trust Account established at the consummation of CCACs initial public offering prior to the Closing. 
 On February 7, 2022, one business day prior to the Closing Date, CCAC effectuated the Domestication, pursuant to which each of CCACs currently issued and outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares automatically converted by operation of law, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of the Companys Common Stock. Similarly, all of CCACs outstanding warrants became warrants to acquire shares of Common Stock, and no other changes were made to the terms of any outstanding warrants. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Legacy Quanergy, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased and Legacy Quanergy became the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Domestication, the Company changed its name from CITIC Capital Acquisition Corp. to Quanergy Systems, Inc. 
 On the Closing Date, purchasers subscribed to purchase from the Company an aggregate of 3,650,000 shares of the Companys common stock (the PIPE Shares), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $36,500,000, pursuant to separate subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements). The sale of PIPE Shares was consummated substantially concurrently with the Closing. 
 In addition, as previously reported, in order to better manage working capital and liquidity needs post Business Combination, CCAC, GEM Global Yield LLC SCS (GEM Investor) and GEM Yield Bahamas Ltd. (GYBL) entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, dated December 12, 2021 (the GEM Agreement), which allows us to fund general corporate purpose and working capital needs. We are entitled to draw up to $125 million of gross proceeds in exchange for Common Stock, at a price equal to 90% of the average closing bid price of the shares of Common Stock on the NYSE for a 30 day period, subject to meeting the terms and conditions of the GEM Agreement. GEM Investor is also entitled to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a warrant exercisable for up to 2.5% of our outstanding Common Stock on a fully diluted basis as of the closing of the Business Combination for a period of 3 years (the GEM Warrant). 
 In January 2022, we negotiated an amendment to the GEM Agreement (the GEM Amendment) to provide for two advance draw downs of $12.5 million each that are not limited based on trading volume. 
 Further information regarding the Business Combination, the GEM Agreement and the Company is set forth in (i) the Companys Definitive Proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on January 6, 2022 (the Proxy Statement) and (ii) the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2022 
 Except as otherwise expressly provided below, this report does not reflect the consummation of the Business Combination which, as discussed above, occurred subsequent to the period covered hereunder.
