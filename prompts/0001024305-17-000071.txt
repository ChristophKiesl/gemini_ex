Item 1. Business. 
Overview
Coty Inc. is one of the world’s largest beauty companies with a purpose to celebrate and liberate the diversity of consumers’ beauty. Founded in 1904, over the years Coty has grown into a multi-segment beauty company with market leading positions in both North America and Europe through new product offerings, diversified sales channels, acquisitions and a global growth strategy. During fiscal 2017, we transformed into a new company with the ambition to be a new leader and challenger in the beauty industry. We acquired certain assets and liabilities related to The Procter & Gamble Company’s (“P&G”) global fine fragrances, salon professional, cosmetics and retail hair color businesses, along with select hair styling brands (the “P&G Beauty Business”), which strengthened and diversified our presence across the countries, categories and channels in which we compete. We also acquired ghd, a premium brand in high-end hair styling appliances, which exposed us to a new product category; entered into a joint venture with Younique LLC (“Younique”), a leading online peer-to-peer social selling platform in beauty, which enhances our direct-to-consumer capabilities through a digital distribution channel; and entered into an agreement to acquire the exclusive long-term global license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare, which augments our presence in prestige fragrances, cosmetics and skincare. These acquisitions complement the addition of the personal care and beauty business of Hypermarcas S.A. (the “Hypermarcas Brands”) to our business in fiscal 2016, which further strengthens our position in the Brazilian beauty and personal care category. Following this transformation, in addition to continuing to grow our portfolio through acquisitions and other strategic transactions, we continue to focus on expanding our global brands into new markets and channels through the introduction of new products and the support of established products. Today, we are the global leader in fragrance, a strong number two in professional salon hair color & styling, and number three in color cosmetics. 
Segments
We are organized into three divisions, which are also our operating and reportable segments: Consumer Beauty, Luxury and Professional Beauty. Our organizational structure is product category focused, putting the consumer first, by specifically targeting how and where they shop and what and why they purchase. Each division has end-to-end responsibility to optimize the consumers’ beauty experiences in their relevant categories.
Consumer Beauty is primarily focused on color cosmetics, retail hair coloring and styling products, body care and mass fragrances primarily in the mass retail channel, e-commerce and social selling direct-to-consumer platform. 
Luxury is primarily focused on prestige fragrances, premium skincare and premium cosmetics across all regions and luxury channels, including travel retail. 
Professional Beauty is primarily focused on servicing salon owners and salon professionals in both hair and nail care, covering all key salon segments and salon client needs. 
For segment and geographic area financial information and information about our long-lived assets, see Note 4, “Segment Reporting” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and for information about recent acquisitions or dispositions of any material amount of assets, see Note 3, “Business Combinations” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Marketing and Sales 
We have dedicated marketing and sales forces in most of our significant markets. We believe that local teams dedicated to the commercialization of our brands give us the greatest opportunity to execute our business strategy. We also develop branding and marketing execution strategies with our top customers.
Our marketing strategy varies by brand and market. We have a diverse portfolio of over 75 brands, and we employ different models to create a distinct image and personality suited to each brand’s equity, distribution, product focus and consumer. Each of our brands is promoted with logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and the uniqueness of each brand. We manage our creative marketing work through a combination of our in-house teams and external agencies that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand. Our marketing teams are also focused on utilizing our digital marketing agency Beamly’s (“Beamly”) digital social listening and trend spotting capabilities to expand digital marketing of our brands. 
One of our strategies is to promote our brands in television, print, outdoor ads, in-store and in-salon displays and to develop and grow promotion on digital and social networks. We also seek editorial coverage for products and brands in both traditional media and digital and social media. We also leverage our relationships with celebrities and on-line influencers to endorse certain of our products.
We are focused on revamping our in-store execution and deploying new brand visuals for certain of our brands. Our marketing efforts benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers, often in connection with in-store marketing activities. Such activities are designed to attract consumers to our counters, displays and walls and so that they try, or purchase, our products. We also engage in sampling and “gift-with-purchase” programs designed to stimulate product trials. 
Our consolidated expenses for advertising and promotional costs were $1,883.3, $967.6 and $1,007.7 in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our consolidated expenses for total marketing and advertising, which includes trade marketing spend, were $2,493.0, $1,363.9 and $1,470.9 in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Distribution Channels and Retail Sales
We market, sell and distribute our products in over 130 countries and territories. We have a balanced multi-channel distribution strategy which complements our product category focused divisions. The Consumer Beauty division primarily sells products through hypermarkets, supermarkets, drug stores and pharmacies, mid-tier department stores, and traditional food and drug retailers. Certain products are sold through our own branded e-commerce websites and direct to consumer websites and third party operated e-commerce websites. The Luxury division primarily sells products through prestige retailers, including upscale perfumeries, upscale department stores and duty-free shops, with travel retail sales channels accounting for 14% of the division’s net revenues. The Professional Beauty division primarily sells products to nail and hair salons, nail and hair professionals and professionals stores. We also sell our products through third-party distributors in countries and territories where we do not have direct distribution. In fiscal 2017, no retailer accounted for more than 10% of our global net revenues; however, certain retailers accounted for more than 10% of net revenues within certain geographic markets and segments. In fiscal 2017, Wal-Mart, our top retailer, accounted for 7% of our net revenues. 
Research and Development
Research and development is a pillar of our innovation. Select key new product developments included COVERGIRL So Lashy, Rimmel Brow Shake Brow Filling Powder and Bourjois Rouge Lacque Lip for Consumer Beauty, System Professional care line, Wella Professionals’ Les beige shades on Koleston Perfect and Color Touch, Wella Professionals Fusion care line for Professional Beauty, and Gucci Bloom and philosophy purity pore extractor for Luxury.
We continuously seek to improve our products through research and development and strive to provide the consumer with the best possible products. Our research and development teams work with our marketing and operations teams, as well as our internal digital agency, Beamly, to identify recent trends and consumer needs and to bring products quickly to market. Additionally, our basic and applied research groups, which conduct longer-term research such as “blue sky” research, seek to develop proprietary new technologies for first-to-market products and for improving existing products. This research and development is done both internally and through affiliations with various universities, technical centers, supply partners, industry associations and technical associations. As of June 30, 2017, we owned approximately 3000 patents and patent applications globally.
Our principal research and development centers are located in the U.S. and Europe. See “Item 2. Properties.”

We do not perform, nor do we commission any third parties on our behalf to perform, testing of our products or ingredients on animals except where required by law. 
Manufacturing and Related Operations and Raw Materials
We manufactured approximately 82% of our products in fiscal 2017, primarily in the United States, Europe and Brazil. Our manufacturing facilities provide multi-segment manufacturing. We recognize the importance of our employees at our manufacturing facilities and have in place programs designed to ensure operating safety. In addition, we implement programs designed to ensure that our manufacturing and distribution facilities comply with applicable environmental rules and regulations. To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis. In connection with the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur operating expenses, including restructuring and related costs aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization (“Global Integration Activities”). For more information about the Global Integration Activities, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operating (Loss) Income—Restructuring and Other Business Realignment Costs” and Note 6 “Restructuring Costs” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are primarily essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals. The essential oils in our fragrance products are generally sourced from fragrance houses. As a result, we realize material cost savings and benefits from the technology, innovation and resources provided by these fragrance houses.
We purchase the raw materials for all our products from various third parties. We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications. We collaborate with our suppliers to meet our stringent design and creative criteria. We believe that we currently have adequate sources of supply for all our products. We have not experienced material disruptions in our supply chain in the past, and we believe we have robust practices in place to respond to potential disruptions in our supply chain. In fiscal 2017, no single supplier accounted for more than 10% of the materials used in the manufacture of our products.
We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels. We are continuing to evaluate and restructure our physical distribution network to improve utilization, increase efficiency and reduce our order lead times.
Competition
We compete against a number of manufacturers and marketers of fragrances, color cosmetics, hair care, salon professional and personal care products. In addition to the established multinational brands against which we compete, small targeted niche brands continue to enter the beauty market. Competition is also increasing from private label products sold by apparel retailers and mass distribution retailers.
We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of perceived value, including pricing and innovation, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and mobile-commerce initiatives, direct sales and other activities (including influencers). It is difficult for us to predict the timing, scale and effectiveness of our competitors’ actions in these areas or the timing and impact of new entrants into the marketplace.
Intellectual Property
We generally own the trademark rights in key sales countries in Trademark International Class 3 (covering cosmetics and perfumery) for use in connection with, among others, the following brands: Astor, Bourjois, Clairol, Coty, COVERGIRL, Joop!, Jovan, Lancaster, Manhattan, Max Factor, Nioxin, N.Y.C. New York Color, OPI, philosophy, Rimmel, Sally Hansen, System Professional and Wella. We license trademarks for the balance of our material product lines, and we are generally the exclusive trademark licensee for all Class 3 trademarks as used in connection with our products. We or our licensors, as the case may be, actively protect the trademarks used in our principal products in the U.S. and significant markets worldwide. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be essential to our business.
A number of our products also incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology in their respective formulations and/or packaging, and in some cases our product packaging is subject to copyright, trade dress or design protection. While we consider our patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is material to the conduct of our business. Products representing a significant portion of our net revenues are manufactured and marketed under exclusive license agreements granted to us for use on a 
4

worldwide and/or regional basis. As of June 30, 2017, we maintained 37 brand licenses. In fiscal 2017, 39% of our net revenues were generated from licensed brands.
Our licenses impose obligations and restrictions on us that we believe are common to many licensing relationships in the beauty industry, such as paying annual royalties on net sales of the licensed products and maintaining the quality of the licensed products and the image of the applicable trademarks. We are currently in material compliance with all terms of our brand license agreements.
Most brand licenses have renewal options for one or more terms, which can range from three to ten years. Certain brand licenses provide for automatic extensions, so long as minimum annual royalty payments are made, while renewal of others is contingent upon attaining of specified sales levels. Seven of our brand licenses expire during fiscal 2018. For additional risks associated with our licensing arrangements, see “Risk Factors—Our brand licenses may be terminated if specified conditions are not met” and “Risk Factors—Our failure to protect our reputation, or the failure of our partners or brand licensors to protect their reputations, could have a material adverse effect on our brand images”.
Employees
As of June 30, 2017, we had approximately 22,000 full-time employees in over 46 countries. In addition, we employ a large number of seasonal contractors during our peak manufacturing and promotional season. We recognize the importance of our employees to our business and believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
Our employees in the U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our employees in certain countries in Europe are subject to works council arrangements. We have not experienced a material strike or work stoppage in the U.S. or any other country where we have a significant number of employees.
Government Regulation
We and our products are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies as well as by various state and local regulatory authorities and by the applicable regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, labeling, manufacturing, packaging, advertising and marketing and sales and distribution of our products. Because we have commercial operations overseas, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) as well as other countries’ anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. 
We are also subject to numerous foreign, federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to land and surface waters, generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. Compliance with such laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, environmental and social responsibility laws and regulations have tended to become increasingly stringent and, to the extent regulatory changes occur in the future, they could result in, among other things, increased costs and risks of non-compliance for us. For example, certain states in the U.S., such as California, and the U.S. Congress have proposed legislation relating to chemical disclosure and other requirements related to the content of our products. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect our business or products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Seasonality
Our sales generally increase during our second fiscal quarter as a result of increased demand by retailers associated with the holiday season. We also experience an increase in sales during our fourth quarter in our Professional Beauty segment as a result of stronger activity prior to the summer holiday season. Working capital requirements, sales, and cash flows generally experience variability during the three to six months preceding the holiday period due in part to product innovations and new product launches and the size and timing of certain orders from our customers. While we continue to attempt to reduce this seasonality, sales volume is, by its nature, difficult to forecast. 
We generally experience peak inventory levels from July to October and peak receivable balances from September to December. During the months of November, December and January of each year, cash is normally generated as customer payments for holiday season orders are received.

In response to this seasonality and other factors, management has implemented various working capital programs aimed at optimizing the effectiveness of our inventories, customer receivables and accounts payable. For example, to improve inventory productivity, we have worked to enhance our sales and operational planning forecasting processes. To improve accounts payable efficiency, we have commenced a harmonization of our vendor management practices across geographies to optimize our payments to vendors. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to seasonal variability.”
