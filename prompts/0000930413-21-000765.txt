Fiscal Year



All references in this report to a particular fiscal year are to REX’s fiscal year ended January 31. For example, “fiscal year 2020” means the period February 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We refer to our fiscal year by reference to the year immediately preceding the January 31 fiscal year end date.
Corporate History and Background



REX was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as a holding company. Our principal offices are located at 7720 Paragon Road, Dayton, Ohio 45459. Our telephone number is (937) 276-3931.



In 2006, we started investing in ethanol production facilities. We are currently invested in three ethanol production entities – One Earth Energy, LLC (“One Earth”), NuGen Energy, LLC (“NuGen”), and Big River Resources, LLC (“Big River”). We own a majority interest in One Earth and NuGen. We also own a majority interest in an entity that owns and operates a refined coal facility. We have two reportable segments: i) ethanol and by-products; and ii) refined coal.

General Overview



Net income attributable to REX common shareholders was approximately $3.0 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to approximately $7.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Both fiscal years 2020 and 2019 benefitted from reductions in our effective tax rate resulting from the impact of federal production tax credits associated with our refined coal operations and from the impact of research and experimentation credits associated with our ethanol and by-products operations. However, as refined coal production declined significantly in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, the benefit of the related tax credits also declined.



Our fiscal year 2020 operations and commodity prices in general were significantly impacted by the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. In an effort to contain the virus, there have been various and prolonged restrictions on travel, public gatherings and work from home orders throughout the world. This has resulted in reduced demand for gasoline and ethanol. Corn pricing was also impacted by this lower demand for ethanol and resulting reduced ethanol production, although China increased its imports of U.S. corn during the latter part of fiscal year 2020 causing corn prices to increase. In the early periods of the Covid-19 pandemic, CBOT ethanol pricing declined sharply to approximately $0.84 per gallon while CBOT corn pricing declined to a low of approximately $3.03 per bushel. These and other market factors led to the shutdown of our NuGen ethanol plant from late March 2020 to late June 2020 and the shutdown of our One Earth ethanol plant from late March 2020 to late May 2020. CBOT ethanol and corn prices were at their highest levels during fiscal year 2020 at the end of January 2021 as the ethanol price was approximately $1.64 per gallon and the corn price was approximately $5.47 per bushel.



The form and structure of our ethanol investments were tailored to the specific needs and goals of each project and the local farmer group or investor with whom we partnered. We generally participate in the management of our projects through our membership on the board of managers of the limited liability companies that own the plants. We provide management oversight and direction with respect to most aspects of plant operations for our consolidated ethanol companies. We have equity investments in three entities engaged in the production of ethanol as of January 31, 2021. The following table is a summary of our ethanol investments at January 31, 2021 (gallons in millions):

Our ethanol operations are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, ethanol, distillers grains, non-food grade corn oil and natural gas. As a result of price volatility for these commodities, our operating results can fluctuate substantially. The price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon several factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, federal policy and foreign trade. Because the market prices of ethanol and distillers grains are not always directly related to corn prices, at times ethanol and/or distillers grains prices may lag movements in corn prices. In an environment of higher corn prices or lower ethanol/distillers grains prices, the overall margin structure at the plants could be reduced. As a result, at times, we may operate our plants at negative or minimally positive operating margins.



We expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately 2.8 gallons of denatured ethanol for each bushel of grain processed in the production cycle. We refer to the actual gallons of denatured ethanol produced per bushel of grain processed as the realized yield. We refer to the difference between the price per gallon of ethanol and the price per bushel of grain (divided by the realized yield) as the “crush spread.” Should the crush spread decline, it is possible that our ethanol plants will generate operating results that do not provide adequate cash flows for sustained periods of time. In such cases, production at the ethanol plants may be reduced or stopped altogether in order to minimize variable costs at individual plants.



We attempt to manage the risk related to the volatility of commodity prices by utilizing forward grain purchase, forward ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil sale contracts, and commodity futures and swap agreements, as management deems appropriate. We attempt to match quantities of these sales contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed. However, the market for future ethanol sales contracts generally lags the spot market with respect to ethanol prices. Consequently, we generally execute fixed price contracts for no more than four months into the future at any given time and we may lock in our corn or ethanol price without having a corresponding locked in ethanol or corn price for short durations of time. As a result of the relatively short period of time our fixed price contracts cover, we generally cannot predict the future movements in our realized crush spread for more than four months; thus, we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future income or loss from the operations of our ethanol facilities. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily exchange traded commodity future and swap contracts, in conjunction with certain of our grain procurement activities and commodity marketing activities.



On August 10, 2017, we purchased, through a 95.35% owned subsidiary, for approximately $12.0 million, the entire ownership interest of an entity that owns a refined coal facility. We began operating the refined coal facility immediately after the acquisition. We expect that the refined coal operating results will be subsidized by federal production tax credits through November 2021, subject to meeting qualified emissions reductions as governed by Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). In order to maintain compliance with Section 45 of the IRC, we are required to test every six months, through an independent laboratory, the effectiveness of our process with respect to emissions reductions. Annually, the IRS publishes the amount of federal income tax credit earned per ton of refined coal produced and sold for a given calendar year, which for 2020 is approximately $7.30 per ton. The tax credits can be earned for refined coal produced and sold by our facility through November 18, 2021. We expect to cease refined coal production operations on or before November 18, 2021.



During fiscal year 2013, we entered into a joint venture with Hytken HPGP LLC (“Hytken”) to file and defend patents for eSteam technology relating to heavy oil and oil sands production methods, and to attempt to commercially exploit the technology to generate license fees, royalty income and development opportunities. The patented technology is an enhanced method of heavy oil recovery involving zero emissions downhole steam generation. To date, we have paid and expensed approximately $2.5 million to purchase our ownership interest and fund patent and other expenses. We have not successfully demonstrated that the technology is commercially feasible. We own 60% and Hytken owns 40% of the entity named Future Energy, LLC (“Future Energy”), an Ohio limited liability company. Future Energy is managed by a board of three managers, two appointed by us and one by Hytken.

We plan to seek and evaluate various investment opportunities including energy related, carbon dioxide related, agricultural or other ventures we believe fit our investment criteria. We can make no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to find such opportunities.



Ethanol Industry



Ethanol is a renewable fuel produced by processing corn and other biomass through a fermentation process that creates combustible alcohol that can be used as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesser extent, as a gasoline substitute. The majority of ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn because of its wide availability and ease of convertibility from large amounts of carbohydrates into glucose, the key ingredient in producing alcohol that is used in the fermentation process. Ethanol production can also use feedstocks such as grain sorghum, switchgrass, wheat, barley, potatoes and sugarcane as carbohydrate sources. Most ethanol plants have been located near large corn production areas, such as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota. Railway access and interstate access are vital for ethanol facilities due to the large amount of raw materials and finished goods required to be shipped to and from the facilities. An adequate supply of natural gas is key to maintaining optimal operating levels.



According to the Renewable Fuels Association (“RFA”), the United States ethanol industry produced an estimated 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol in 2020, which represents a decline of approximately 2.0 billion gallons from 2019, primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. Approximately 1.3 billion gallons were exported from the United States in 2020. According to the RFA, the United States ethanol industry consists of 208 plants in 25 states with an annual capacity of approximately 17.4 billion gallons of ethanol production.



Domestic demand for ethanol is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation and regulations. On December 19, 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the “Energy Act of 2007”) was enacted. The Energy Act of 2007 established new levels of renewable fuel mandates, including two different categories of renewable fuels: conventional biofuels and advanced biofuels. The federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under Renewable Fuel Standard II (“RFS II”), established in October 2010. Corn-based ethanol is considered a conventional biofuel which is subject to a renewable fuel standard (“RFS”) of 15.0 billion gallons annually through 2022. After 2022, RFS volumes will be determined by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture.



The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if one of two conditions is met: 1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, or 2) implementation of the mandate requirement severely harms the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, the EPA took action to reduce the volumes for both conventional biofuels and advanced biofuels. The U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit ruled on July 28, 2017 against the EPA related to its decision to lower the 2016 volume requirements. As a result, the Court vacated the EPA’s decision to reduce the total renewable fuel volume requirements by 500 million gallons for 2016 through its waiver authority. To date, the EPA has not reinstated these gallons.



Under RFS II, a small refiner that processes less than 75,000 barrels of oil per day can petition the EPA for a waiver of their requirement to submit renewable identification numbers (“RINs”). The EPA, through consultation with the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture, can grant the refiner a full or partial waiver, or deny the waiver. The EPA issued 85 refinery exemptions for 2016-2018 compliance years, undercutting the statutory renewable fuel volumes by a total of 4.0 billion gallons. In its final rule establishing the 2020 renewable fuel volume obligations, the EPA stated it will reallocate gallons lost to exemptions, based on a rolling three year average of what the Department of Energy has recommended, and extend this to the 2019 compliance year. On average, these recommendations have represented only about half of the waivers the EPA has granted. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit recently vacated decisions by the EPA to

extend exemptions of renewable fuel obligations to three small refineries. The Court ruled the extensions should not have been granted because the three refineries were not already in possession of exemptions. In addition, the Court ruled the economic hardship should be determined by whether complying with RFS II created the hardship solely, not compliance with RFS II amongst other factors. The oil refiners appeal was denied. Two of the refiners appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and in January 2021, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.



Ethanol Production



The plants we have invested in are designed to use the dry milling method of producing ethanol. In the dry milling process, the entire corn kernel is first ground into flour, which is referred to as “meal,” and processed without separating out the various component parts of the grain. The meal is processed with enzymes, chemicals and water, and then placed in a high-temperature cooker. It is then transferred to fermenters where yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol begins. After fermentation, the resulting liquid is transferred to distillation columns where the ethanol is separated from the remaining “stillage” for fuel uses. The anhydrous ethanol is then blended with a denaturant, such as natural gasoline, to render it undrinkable and thus not subject to beverage alcohol tax. With the starch elements of the corn consumed in the above described process, the principal by-product produced by the dry milling process is dry distillers grains with solubles, or DDGS. DDGS is sold as a protein used in animal feed, which recovers a portion of the corn value not absorbed in ethanol production. Depending on market and operating conditions, we may also sell modified distillers grains, or wet distillers grains, by removing less liquid content compared to DDGS. We also generate revenues from the sale of non-food grade corn oil produced at our facilities. Non-food grade corn oil is sold to the animal feed market, as well as biodiesel and other chemical markets. 
The Primary Uses of Ethanol



Blend component. Today, much of the ethanol blending in the U.S. is done to meet the RFS. Most regular gasoline is produced using blendstock with an octane rating of 84, which is then increased to 87 (the minimum octane rating required in most states) by adding 10% ethanol according to the RFA. The industry is attempting to expand ethanol blending above the current 10% for most vehicles in use. The EPA has approved the use of 15% ethanol (“E-15”), which has an octane rating of 88, in gasoline for cars, SUV’s and light duty trucks made in 2001 and later. Previously, the EPA had not granted E-15 the same Reid vapor pressure (“RVP”) waiver as E-10 so it could only be sold from September 16 through May 31 for those vehicles in most markets. In May 2019, the EPA finalized regulatory changes to allow the same RVP waiver for E-15 for the summer months that it allows for E-10. This may remove a significant barrier to wider sales of E-15, although E-15 sales are still limited by the lack of infrastructure at retail locations to dispense E-15.



Clean air additive. Ethanol is employed by the refining industry as a fuel oxygenate, which when blended with gasoline, allows engines to combust fuel more completely and reduce emissions from motor vehicles, than gasoline that has not been oxygenated. Ethanol contains 35% oxygen, which results in more complete combustion of the fuel in the engine cylinder. Oxygenated gasoline is used to help meet certain federal and air emission standards.



Octane enhancer.  Ethanol increases the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended. Octane is a measure of fuel performance. Ethanol is used by gasoline suppliers as an octane enhancer both for producing regular grade gasoline from lower octane blending stocks and for upgrading regular gasoline to premium grades.

Legislation



The United States ethanol industry is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of legislation affecting the U.S. ethanol industry.
Refined Coal Overview



On August 10, 2017, we purchased, through a 95.35% owned subsidiary, the entire ownership interest of an entity that owns a refined coal facility. We began operating the refined coal facility immediately after the acquisition. Using licensed technology, our plant applies two separate chemicals to convert feedstock coal into refined coal, which is sold to the end user of the refined coal. We expect that the refined coal operating results will be subsidized by federal production tax credits through November 18, 2021, subject to meeting qualified emissions reductions as governed by Section 45 of the IRC. In order to maintain compliance with Section 45 of the IRC, we are required to test every six months, through an independent laboratory, the effectiveness of our process with respect to emissions reductions. Annually, the IRS publishes the amount of federal income tax credit earned per ton of refined coal produced and sold for a given calendar year, which for 2020 was approximately $7.30 per ton.



Section 45 of the IRC was created by Congress to encourage the development and use of environmentally sound solutions to control harmful emissions during energy production and to facilitate and move the United States towards better compliance with global environmental energy standards. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 amended Section 45 of the IRC by adding provisions to incentivize the production of emission reducing refined coal. To qualify for tax credits under Section 45 of the IRC, a process must reduce coal emissions of nitrogen oxide by 20% and either sulfur dioxide or mercury by 40%. The tax credits can be earned for refined coal produced and sold by our facility through November 18, 2021. Absent the tax credits, our refined coal operations would not be profitable.



Facilities



As of our fiscal year end, our consolidated ethanol entities owned a combined 1,122 acres of land and two facilities that shipped a combined quantity of approximately 217 million gallons of ethanol in fiscal year 2020. We also own our corporate headquarters office building, consisting of approximately 7,500 square feet, located in Dayton, Ohio. We own a refined coal plant that is located on leased property on the site of an electrical generating station.
Human Capital Resources



The attraction, retention and development of employees is critical to our success. We accomplish these objectives through a variety of actions, including our competitive compensation policies, training initiatives and growth opportunities within our Company. At January 31, 2021, we had 119 employees at our two consolidated ethanol plants and at our corporate headquarters. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We expect this employment level to remain relatively stable. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.



We took measures to protect the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic while continuing to meet the needs of our customers. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including our employees, and take appropriate actions to mitigate the impact including emphasizing CDC guidelines.

We conduct regularly scheduled safety meetings and require all employees to go through safety training. We evaluate employee safety incidents monthly and investigate such incidents promptly. In addition, we conduct periodic safety audits performed by an independent third party. A portion of our incentive compensation plan rewards employees for attaining certain safety goals.



We believe we offer market competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees. In addition to competitive base wages, employees are eligible for an incentive compensation program, a Company matched 401(k) plan, healthcare benefits, and paid time off.



Service Marks



We have registered the service marks “REX”, and “Farmer’s Energy”, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We are not aware of any adverse claims concerning our service marks.
