Overview
​
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents in the United States, Europe and additional international markets. We target our development programs for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations, and simultaneously develop, with partners, for those indications that require them, diagnostic tools intended to direct a compound in development to the population that is most likely to benefit from its use.
​
Rubraca® is an oral small molecule inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (“PARP”) marketed in the United States for two indications specific to recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer and also an indication specific to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”). The initial indication received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in December 2016 and covers the treatment of adult patients with deleterious BRCA (human genes associated with the repair of damaged DNA) mutation (germline and/or

somatic)-associated epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. Rubraca received a second approval from FDA in April 2018 for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Diagnostic testing is not required for patients to be prescribed Rubraca in this maintenance treatment indication.
​
In May 2020, the FDA also approved Rubraca for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC associated with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been treated previously with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. The FDA approved this indication under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response data from the TRITON2 clinical trial. As an accelerated approval, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. The TRITON3 clinical trial is expected to serve as the confirmatory study for Rubraca’s approval in mCRPC as well as the basis for us to seek a potential second-line label expansion. We anticipate the initial data readout from TRITON3 in the second quarter of 2022. 
​
In Europe, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization in May 2018 for Rubraca as monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum-based chemotherapy. In January 2019, the European Commission granted a variation to the marketing authorization to include the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. With this approval, Rubraca is authorized in Europe for certain patients in the recurrent ovarian cancer maintenance setting regardless of their BRCA mutation status. Following successful reimbursement negotiations, Rubraca is marketed in each of Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
​
Beyond our labeled indications, we have a clinical development program underway to further evaluate Rubraca in a variety of solid tumor types, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, including the ATHENA Phase 3 study as part of our ongoing clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (“Bristol Myers Squibb”) to evaluate its immunotherapy OPDIVO® (nivolumab) in combination with Rubraca. We anticipate initial data from two independent readouts for ATHENA during 2022: Rubraca monotherapy versus placebo (ATHENA-MONO) in the second quarter of 2022, with results of the separate analysis of Rubraca in combination with Opdivo (ATHENA-COMBO) anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
​
The three anticipated data readouts, ATHENA-MONO, ATHENA-COMBO and TRITON3 discussed above, provide the potential to obtain approvals that reach larger patient populations in earlier lines of therapy for ovarian and prostate cancers. Following availability of top-line results from ATHENA-MONO, we plan to file a supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) with the FDA and request a variation to the European MAA, and we plan to do the same for the subsequent TRITON3 and ATHENA-COMBO anticipated data readouts, assuming, in each case, that the Phase 3 clinical data is supportive. 
​
The timing for each Phase 3 data readout is contingent upon the occurrence of the protocol-specified progression free survival (“PFS”) events, and timing estimates are based on event-based projections.
​
We hold worldwide rights to Rubraca. 
​
FAP-2286 is our initial product candidate to emerge from our targeted radionuclide therapy collaboration with 3B Pharmaceuticals GmbH (“3BP”). FAP-2286 is a peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy (“PTRT”) and imaging agent targeting fibroblast activation protein (“FAP”). PTRT uses cancer cell-targeting peptides to deliver radiation-emitting radionuclides specifically to tumors. Following the clearance by FDA of two INDs submitted in December 2020 to support the use of FAP-2286 as an imaging and treatment agent, we initiated the phase 1 portion of the LuMIERE clinical study in June 2021. LuMIERE is a phase 1/2 study of FAP-2286 labeled with lutetium-177 (177Lu-FAP-2286) evaluating the compound in patients with advanced solid tumors to determine the dose, schedule, and tolerability of FAP-2286 as a therapeutic agent with expansion cohorts planned in multiple tumor types as part of a global development

program. FAP-2286 labeled with gallium-68 (68Ga-FAP-2286) is being utilized to identify tumors that contain FAP for treatment in this study.
​
During 2022, we also anticipate the first presentation of phase 1 data from LuMIERE at nuclear medicine-focused meetings, additional presentations of non-clinical data for FAP-2286 and the launch of our combination study program to explore FAP-2286 in combination with other oncology compounds, and in 2023, a potential IND filing of FAP-2286 linked to a FAP-targeted alpha-emitter PTRT. 
​
We hold U.S. and global rights to FAP-2286, excluding Europe (defined to include Russia, Turkey and Israel), where 3BP retains rights. 
​
We are also collaborating with 3BP on a discovery program directed to up to three additional, undisclosed targets for targeted radionuclide therapy, to which we would have global rights for any resulting product candidates. 
​
Lucitanib, our product candidate currently in clinical development, is an investigational, oral, potent angiogenesis inhibitor which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (“VEGFR1-3”), platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (“PDGFR α/β”) and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (“FGFR1-3”). Lucitanib inhibits the same three pathways as Lenvima® (lenvatinib), which has received an FDA approval for use in certain populations of patients with endometrial cancer in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), a PD-1 inhibitor. This, together with preclinical data for lucitanib in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor that demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to that of single agents, represent a scientific rationale for development of lucitanib in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, and in February 2019, lucitanib was added to our clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb. The phase 1b/2 LIO-1 study is evaluating the combination of lucitanib and Opdivo in gynecologic cancers. Interim data from the non-clear cell ovarian cancer expansion cohort were presented at ASCO 2021 and the initial efficacy data do not support further development in non-clear cell ovarian cancer. The remaining three cohorts, which include non-clear cell endometrial, cervical and clear-cell ovarian and endometrial cancers, showed sufficient responses in stage one of each of the cohorts to advance to stage 2. The data from the cervical cohort have been accepted as a plenary presentation at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) 2022 Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer in March 2022 and represent encouraging data in this subset of gynecological cancers. However, given the competing priorities, including development of FAP-2286, we have determined that we will not pursue further development of lucitanib in gynecological cancers at this time.
​
We hold the global (excluding China) development and commercialization rights for lucitanib.
​
Clovis was founded in 2009. We have built our organization to support innovative oncology drug development for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations. To implement our strategy, we have assembled an experienced team with core competencies in global clinical and non-clinical development, regulatory operations and commercialization in oncology, as well as establishing collaborative relationships with companies specializing in companion diagnostic development.
​
We have three key strategies on which we remain focused: first, we seek to drive Rubraca revenue growth; second, we intend to grow our targeted radionuclide therapy program, which includes the currently enrolling LuMIERE phase 1/2 clinical study of FAP-2286, which is the PTRT targeting FAP; and third, we seek to achieve long-term financial stability.
​
Our Products and Development Strategy
​
We continue to evaluate the use of Rubraca for selected patient populations and, where appropriate, collaborate with partners for companion diagnostic development. We have focused our development strategy for Rubraca on indications where we believe patient populations exhibit higher frequencies of mutant BRCA tumors or tumors with other homologous recombination deficiencies (“HRD”), where PARP inhibitors have demonstrated clinical or pre-clinical activity in tumors. In the emerging field of targeted radionuclide therapy, our lead candidate, FAP-2286 targets fibroblast activation protein, which is highly expressed across multiple solid tumor types, and is a target of increasing interest for oncology drug development. The following table summarizes the principal ongoing or planned Clovis- or collaborator-sponsored studies:

In certain of these trials, we or our collaborators may have access to interim data on a periodic or continuing basis that will not be made available publicly on the same timeframe as such data becomes available to us, or at all.
​
Rubraca – a PARP Inhibitor
​
Overview
​
Rubraca is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3. We in-licensed Rubraca from Pfizer, Inc. in June 2011 and hold exclusive worldwide rights. Rubraca has received regulatory approvals in the United States and Europe for patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Rubraca also received regulatory approval in the United States as a monotherapy treatment of adult patients with BRCA1/2-mutant recurrent, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.
​
In the United States, Rubraca is approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious BRCA (human genes associated with the repair of damaged DNA) mutation (germline and/or somatic)-associated epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. BRCA mutations are believed to occur in approximately 25% of women with ovarian cancer. In April 2018, based on positive date from the phase 3 ARIEL3 clinical trial described below, the FDA granted a second approval for Rubraca for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy, a broader and earlier-line indication. Diagnostic testing is not required for patients to be prescribed Rubraca in this maintenance treatment indication.
​
Rubraca is also approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC associated with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been treated previously with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for

Rubraca. The FDA approved this indication in May 2020 under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response data from the TRITON2 clinical trial. As an accelerated approval, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. The TRITON3 clinical trial, anticipated to read out in the second quarter of 2022, is expected to serve as the confirmatory study for Rubraca’s approval in mCRPC as well as a potential second-line label expansion.
​
In Europe, Rubraca is authorized for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of their BRCA mutation status. Following successful reimbursement negotiations, Rubraca has been launched in each of Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
​
The Role of PARP Inhibition in Cancer Therapy 
​
Cells in the human body are under constant attack from agents that can cause damage to DNA, including sunlight and other forms of radiation, as well as DNA-binding chemicals that can cause changes in the composition of DNA. Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to enable such DNA repair, and these mechanisms are complementary to each other, each driving repair of specific types of DNA damage. If a cell’s DNA damage repair system is overwhelmed, then the cell will die undergoing a form of suicide termed apoptosis. A fundamental principle of cancer therapy is to damage cells profoundly with radiation or DNA-binding drugs, such as alkylating agents or platinums, to induce apoptosis, and thus cancer cell death. Multiple DNA repair mechanisms active in the cell may reduce the activity of these anti-cancer therapies.
​
The PARP family comprises 17 structurally related proteins that have been identified on the basis of sequence similarity. PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3 play a central role in DNA repair. They are rapidly recruited to the sites of DNA damage and catalyze the recruitment of additional proteins that initiate the repair of damaged DNA. The breast cancer 1 (“BRCA1”) and breast cancer 2 (“BRCA2”) genes also have important roles in DNA repair pathways such as homologous recombination. According to the National Cancer Institute, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are associated with an increased risk of ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers.
 ​
Rubraca is an inhibitor of PARP enzymes, including PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3. PARP inhibitors have shown activity in BRCA1/2 mutant and homologous recombination (“HR”) repair deficient cancer cell lines through a mechanism known as synthetic lethality in which the loss of two genes/pathways is required for cell death. The inhibition/inactivation of repair pathways by administration of a PARP inhibitor in the context of an underlying genetic defect such as a BRCA mutation results in tumor cell death through accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage. 
​
Alterations in DNA repair genes other than BRCA1/2 have been observed in, and contribute to the hereditary risk of, ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. PARP inhibitors have shown evidence of nonclinical and clinical activity in tumors with alterations in non-BRCA HR genes. DNA repair deficiencies resulting from genetic and epigenetic alterations can result in a “BRCA-like” phenotype that may also render tumor cells sensitive to PARP inhibitors. One approach to identify patients with DNA repair deficiencies due to mechanisms other than a mutation in BRCA or other non-BRCA HR genes is to assess loss of heterozygosity (“LOH”), or the loss of one normal copy of a gene, which arises from error-prone DNA repair pathways when HR is compromised. 
​
On the basis of these scientific observations, we initially developed Rubraca in ovarian cancer patients with tumors having BRCA mutations or other HRD, and these molecular markers will be further explored in the Rubraca Phase 3 studies anticipated to read out during 2022.
​
Ovarian cancer
​
According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated more than 19,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the United States and there will be an estimated nearly 13,000 deaths from ovarian cancer in 2022, and according to GLOBOCAN in 2020, an estimated 66,000 women in Europe are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer, and ovarian cancer is among those cancers with the highest rate of deaths. According to the NIH National Cancer Institute, more than 75% of women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer at an advanced stage.

Rubraca’s approvals in the U.S. and Europe in the recurrent BRCA mutant ovarian cancer treatment setting were based on data from two multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trials, Study 10 (NCT01482715) and ARIEL2 (NCT01891344), in women with advanced BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer who had progressed after two or more prior chemotherapies. All patients received Rubraca orally 600 mg twice daily as monotherapy. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome measure of both studies was objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (“RECIST”) version 1.1. Results from a blinded independent radiology review (“BICR”) were consistent.
​
The efficacy of Rubraca in the ovarian cancer maintenance treatment setting was investigated in ARIEL3 (NCT01968213), a double-blind, multicenter clinical trial in which 564 patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who were in response to platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized (2:1) to receive Rubraca tablets 600 mg orally twice daily (n=375) or placebo (n=189). Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients had achieved a response (complete or partial) to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by best response to last platinum (complete or partial), time to progression following the penultimate platinum therapy (6 to < 12 months and ≥ 12 months), and tumor biomarker status. The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECISTv1.1. 
​
The primary efficacy analysis evaluated three prospectively defined molecular sub-groups in a step-down manner: 1) tumor BRCA mutant (“tBRCAmut”) patients, inclusive of germline and somatic BRCA mutations (n=196); 2) HRD patients, including tBRCAmut patients and BRCA wild-type with high LOH (n=354), and, finally, 3) the intent-to-treat population, or all patients treated in ARIEL3 (n=564). ARIEL3 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to Rubraca as compared with placebo in all patients, and in the HRD and tBRCAmut subgroups. Median PFS in the tBRCAmut patients was 16.6 months (95% CI: 13.4–22.9) in the Rubraca group (n=130) versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 3.4–6.7) in the placebo group (n=66) (Hazard Ratio, or HR: 0.23 [95% CI: 0.16–0.34]; p<0.0001). Median PFS in the HRD patients was 13.6 months (95% CI: 10.9–16.2) in the Rubraca group (n=236) versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 5.1–5.6) in the placebo group (n=118) (HR: 0.32 [95% CI: 0.24–0.42]; p<0·0001). Median PFS in the intent-to-treat population was 10.8 months (95% CI: 8.3–11.4) in the Rubraca group (n=375) versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 5.3–5.5) in the placebo group (n=189) (HR: 0.36 [95% CI: 0.30–0.45]; p<0·0001). An exploratory analysis in the HRD/BRCA wild-type population demonstrated a median PFS of 9.7 months (95% CI: 7.9–13.1) in the Rubraca group (n=106) versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.1–5.7) in the placebo group (n=52) (HR: 0.44 [95% CI: 0.29–0.66]); p<0.0001).
​
BICR results were consistent. In a pre-specified analysis of the key stand-alone secondary endpoint of progression-free survival assessed by BICR, PFS was also improved in the Rubraca group compared with placebo in all three populations. Median PFS in the tBRCAmut patients was 26.8 months (95% CI: 19.2 to not reached) in the Rubraca group versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.9–8.1) in the placebo group (HR: 0.20 [95% CI: 0.13–0.32]; p<0.0001). Median PFS in the HRD patients was 22.9 months (95% CI: 16.2 to not reported) in the Rubraca group versus 5.5 months (95% CI: 5.1–7.4) in the placebo group (HR: 0.34 [95% CI: 0.24–0.47]; p<0.0001). Median PFS in the intent-to-treat population was 13.7 months (95% CI: 11.0–19.1) versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 5.1–5.5) in the placebo group (HR: 0.35 [0.28–0.45]; p<0.0001). An exploratory analysis in the HRD/BRCA wild-type population demonstrated a median PFS of 11.1 months (95% CI: 8.2-NR) in the Rubraca group (n=106) versus 5.6 months (95% CI: 2.9–8.2) in the placebo group (n=52) (HR: 0.55 [95% CI: 0.35–0.89]; p=0.0135).
​
Enrollment in ARIEL3 included one-third of patients who had achieved a complete response to their prior platinum-based therapy, and two-thirds of patients who had achieved a partial response to their prior platinum-based therapy. Of those with a partial response, 37% had measurable disease at the time of enrollment and were therefore evaluable for response. The confirmed overall response rate by investigator-assessed RECISTv1.1 in the tBRCAmut group treated with Rubraca was 37.5% (15/40), of these, 17.5% (7/40) were complete responses. This compared with 9% (2/23) in the placebo group (p=0.0055). No complete responses were seen in the tBRCAmut placebo group. RECIST responses were also observed in BRCA wild-type HRD-positive and BRCA wild-type HRD-negative subgroups. In a subsequent post hoc exploratory analysis of ARIEL3 data, a higher response rate was also seen in patients without measurable disease in both the tBRCAmut group and the intent to treat population (inclusive of BRCAmut patients) as compared to placebo. RECIST responses were not assessed by independent blinded review.
​
Safety data from ARIEL3 demonstrated consistency with prior Rubraca studies. Treatment emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) in the ARIEL3 Rubraca group were generally managed with dose modifications and not associated with increased mortality or morbidity compared with the placebo group. The most common (occurring in ≥5% of patients) 

8




TEAEs of grade ≥3 reported in patients treated with Rubraca in the ARIEL3 study were anemia/decreased hemoglobin (21%), increase in ALT/AST (10%), neutropenia (7%), asthenia/fatigue (7%) and thrombocytopenia (5%). The discontinuation rate for TEAEs (excluding disease progression) was 15% for Rubraca-treated patients and 2% for the placebo arm. In ARIEL3, the rate of treatment-emergent myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”)/acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) in the Rubraca arm was <1% (3/372), and no patients on the placebo arm experienced treatment-emergent MDS/AML. In approximately 1,100 patients treated with Rubraca, MDS/AML occurred in 10 patients (0.9%), including those in long term follow-up. Of these, 5 occurred during treatment or during the 28-day safety follow-up (0.5%). The duration of Rubraca treatment prior to the diagnosis of MDS/AML ranged from 1 month to approximately 28 months. The cases were typical of secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML; in all cases, patients had received previous platinum containing chemotherapy regimens and/or other DNA damaging agents.
​
At the time of the analysis of PFS, overall survival (OS) data were not mature (with 22% of events). The comprehensive dataset for ARIEL3 was presented at the 2017 European Society of Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress in early September 2017 and subsequently published in The Lancet. The ARIEL3 dataset formed the basis for sNDA filed with the FDA as well as the marketing authorization variation filed with the EMA supporting the approval of Rubraca in the US in April 2018 and Europe in January 2019 respectively, as maintenance treatment in adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.
​
The ARIEL4 confirmatory study (NCT 02855944) is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized study of Rubraca versus chemotherapy, which enrolled 349 relapsed ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutations (inclusive of germline and/or somatic) who had received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed progression-free survival (“InvPFS”), with a step-down analysis from the efficacy population (if significant) to the intent to treat (“ITT”) population. The efficacy population comprised the group of patients with a deleterious tumor BRCA mutation and excluded those with a BRCA reversion mutation as determined by a blood test. Development of reversion mutations that restore BRCA protein function are associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapies and PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutant cancers, and these occur more frequently in platinum-resistant vs platinum-sensitive patients (13% and 2% respectively in the ARIEL2 study). 
​
In December 2020, we announced that Rubraca met the primary study endpoint of significantly improving InvPFS versus chemotherapy in the primary efficacy population with a hazard ratio of 0.64 (p=0.001). The median PFS for the patients in the efficacy population treated with rucaparib was 7.4 months versus 5.7 months among those who received chemotherapy. Additionally, in the ITT population, the rucaparib arm achieved statistical significance over the chemotherapy arm for the primary endpoint of PFS with a hazard ratio of 0.67 (p=0.002). The median PFS for the patients in the ITT population treated with rucaparib was 7.4 months versus 5.7 months among those who received chemotherapy. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profiles of Rubraca and chemotherapy. Patients with a BRCA reversion mutation represented 7% of patients enrolled in the study and as anticipated, InvPFS results for those patients showed limited benefit from Rubraca therapy. An interim analysis of overall survival, a secondary endpoint in the study in which 51% of events had occurred in the intent-to-treat population, showed a trend toward an overall survival advantage in the chemotherapy arm, but was confounded by the high rate (64%) of per-protocol crossover to Rubraca following progression on chemotherapy. An analysis of the ITT population of patients showed a trend toward an OS advantage for those patients who received Rubraca at any point in the trial versus those who did not. ARIEL4 study results were presented at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology Virtual Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer (SGO) in March 2021. Completion of ARIEL4 is a post-marketing commitment in the U.S. and Europe and the clinical study report for the trial has been submitted to the regulatory authorities for review to satisfy this commitment.

Prostate cancer
​
The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 268,000 men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2022, and the GLOBOCAN Cancer Fact Sheets estimated that approximately 473,000 men in Europe were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020. Castrate-resistant prostate cancer has a high likelihood of developing metastases. Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”) is an incurable disease, usually associated with poor prognosis. Approximately 43,000 men in the U.S. are expected to be diagnosed with mCRPC in 2020. According to the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for mCRPC is approximately 30%. A number of publications have reported germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are approximately 12% in mCRPC according to an article published in JCO Precision Oncology in 2017. These molecular markers may be used to select patients for treatment with a PARP inhibitor.

 ​
The TRITON (Trial of Rucaparib in Prostate Indications) program in prostate cancer initiated in the second half of 2016, and currently includes two Clovis-sponsored studies. Enrollment is complete for both TRITON2 and TRITON3.
​
The TRITON2 study (NCT02952534) is a multicenter Phase 2 single-arm study of Rubraca in men with mCRPC that enrolled patients with BRCA mutations (inclusive of germline and/or somatic) or other deleterious mutations in other homologous recombination repair genes. Patients in the TRITON2 study have received prior treatment with at least one androgen receptor (“AR”)-directed therapy and one previous line of taxane-based chemotherapy and were screened for a deleterious germline or somatic mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2 or one of 13 other pre-specified homologous recombination (“HR”) genes. Study participants were allocated into three cohorts based on the type of gene mutation and disease status, as determined by genomic sequencing and RECIST criteria, respectively. Each cohort receives 600 mg Rubraca twice daily and are grouped based on the following criteria: A) mutation in either BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM genes, with tumors that can be measured with visceral and/or nodal disease; B) mutation in either BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM genes, with tumors that cannot be measured with visceral and/or nodal disease, or C) mutation in another HR gene associated with sensitivity to PARP inhibition, with or without measurable disease. The primary study endpoints include confirmed ORR and duration of response (“DOR”) per modified RECIST v.1.1/PCWG3 criteria assessed by BICR in patients with measurable disease at baseline by independent review and PSA response in patients with no measurable disease at baseline. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (“OS”), clinical benefit rate, and safety and tolerability.
​
Efficacy and safety data from TRITON2 formed the basis of a sNDA that was submitted to FDA in late 2019. Evaluable patient populations in the sNDA dataset included the following: 62 RECIST-evaluable patients with a BRCA (germline and/or somatic) mutation and measurable disease (BICR); 115 patients with a BRCA (germline and/or somatic) mutation and measurable or non-measurable disease; and 209 patients with HRD-positive mCRPC. The RECIST-evaluable patient population demonstrated a 44% ORR (N=62; 95% CI 31, 57) by BICR. Objective response rates were similar for patients with a germline BRCA versus somatic BRCA mutation. Median DOR was not evaluable at data cut-off. Additionally, a 55% confirmed PSA response rate (95% CI 45, 64) was observed in an analysis of 115 patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) and measurable or non-measurable disease.
​
TRITON2 evaluated the safety of Rubraca 600 mg twice daily as monotherapy treatment in the 209 patients with HRD-positive mCRPC enrolled in the study, including the 115 with BRCA-mutated mCRPC. The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20% of patients; CTCAE Grade 1-4) occurring in the BRCA mutant population (n=115) were asthenia/fatigue, nausea, anemia, ALT/AST increased, decreased appetite, constipation, rash, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (greater than or equal to 35% of patients; CTCAE Grade 1-4) were increase in ALT, decrease in leukocytes, decrease in phosphate, decrease in absolute neutrophil count, decrease in hemoglobin, increase in alkaline phosphatase, increase in creatinine, increase in triglycerides, decrease in lymphocytes, decrease in platelets, and decrease in sodium.
​
In May 2020, the FDA approved Rubraca for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC associated with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been treated previously with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy and are selected for therapy with an FDA-approved companion diagnostic. The FDA approved this indication under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response data from the TRITON2 clinical trial. As an accelerated approval, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. The TRITON3 clinical trial is expected to serve as the confirmatory study for Rubraca’s approval in mCRPC. Foundation Medicine’s blood based diagnostic test, FoundationOne Liquid CDx, approved by the FDA in August 2020, is a companion diagnostic for the detection of deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) to select mCRPC patients for treatment with Rubraca.
​
The TRITON3 study (NCT02975934) is a Phase 3 comparative study in men with mCRPC enrolling BRCA mutant and ATM (both inclusive of germline and/or somatic) patients who have progressed on AR-targeted therapy and who have not yet received chemotherapy in the castrate-resistant setting. TRITON3 will compare Rubraca to physician’s choice of AR-targeted therapy or chemotherapy in these patients. The planned primary endpoint of the study is radiologic PFS. TRITON3 initiated during the first quarter of 2017, and topline data from TRITON3 are anticipated in the second quarter of 2022, contingent upon the occurrence of the protocol-specified number of PFS events.
​
The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology is sponsoring the Phase 3 CASPAR study (NCT04455750) comparing the combination of enzalutamide and Rubraca to enzalutamide alone in mCRPC. The study, which is currently enrolling 

10




patients, is expected to enroll approximately 1,000 patients in the United States at National Clinical Trials Network (“NCTN”) sites nationally and is currently the only study evaluating the combination of a PARP inhibitor and a novel anti-androgen with an overall survival endpoint. The Alliance is part of the NCTN sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. CASPAR is currently enrolling patients.
​
LODESTAR tumor-agnostic study 
​
The LODESTAR clinical study (NCT04171700) is a Phase 2 study evaluating Rubraca as monotherapy treatment in patients with recurrent solid tumors associated with a deleterious mutation in a homologous recombination repair (“HRR”) gene across a variety of tumor types. The primary cohort includes patients with tumor mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D as well as an exploratory cohort that includes patients with tumor mutations in several additional genes. The study initiated in late 2019 and based on initial results from the ongoing study, we saw encouraging evidence of activity in patients with a biallelic tumor mutation of BRCA or other target genes. Importantly, for BRCA-mutated breast and pancreatic and certain other tumors types, the majority of tumors have biallelic loss. Despite these encouraging data in a molecularly-defined subset of patients, we have determined that the expected time to enrollment and the requirement to conduct a confirmatory study in this population do not represent a sufficiently significant opportunity to pursue further, as compared to our other alternatives, including development of FAP-2286.
​
Opdivo combination trials
Our ongoing collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb involves the evaluation of the combination of Rubraca with Bristol Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy Opdivo® (nivolumab) in ovarian cancer in the Phase 3 ATHENA study.
We believe that a preclinical rationale supports the potential of the combination of our PARP inhibitor Rubraca with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as the PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo. BRCA1 and BRCA2 and other HRD mutations are associated with increased tumor mutational burden, which may create additional tumor-specific antigens or “neoepitopes.” Increased tumor mutation burden has been shown to correlate with increased benefit from immune checkpoint blockade. In addition, cell death that is induced by a PARP inhibitor is considered immunogenic and stimulates a “STING-like” pathway due to fragmented DNA release into cytosol. In mice studies, rucaparib and an anti-PD-1 antibody demonstrated anti-tumor activity in BRCA1 mutant ovarian tumors. The combination of rucaparib and either an anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibody were equally compelling in preclinical studies.
The Clovis-sponsored Phase 3 ATHENA study is evaluating the combination of Rubraca and Opdivo, and in February 2019, lucitanib was added to the clinical collaboration in combinations with Opdivo. 
ATHENA is a four-arm first-line maintenance treatment study (NCT03522246) to evaluate Rubraca and Opdivo, Rubraca, Opdivo, and placebo in approximately 1,000 newly diagnosed patients with stage III/IV high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have completed platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary objectives are first, to determine if Rubraca extends PFS versus placebo (ATHENA-MONO), and second, to determine if the combination of Rubraca and Opdivo meaningfully extends PFS versus Rubraca monotherapy (ATHENA-COMBO). The ATHENA study, which initiated in 2018 and completed enrollment in the second quarter of 2020, evaluates Rubraca in terms of two key outcomes in a step-down manner: monotherapy versus placebo in the first-line maintenance setting in the HRD population, inclusive of BRCA, and in the all comers (intent-to-treat) population, and later, any potential advantage for the combination of Rubraca and Opdivo in the all comers (intent-to-treat) population. ATHENA is the first front-line switch maintenance study to evaluate a PARP inhibitor as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 in one study design. We anticipate the results of the Rubraca monotherapy arm versus placebo in all study populations in the second quarter of 2022, and then, during the fourth quarter of 2022, the results of Rubraca plus Opdivo versus Rubraca in the intent-to-treat study population. The timing of the two ATHENA readouts (ATHENA-MONO and ATHENA-COMBO) contingent upon the occurrence of the protocol-specified PFS events. 
The phase 1b/2 LIO-1 study is evaluating the combination of lucitanib and Opdivo in gynecologic cancers. Interim data from the non-clear cell ovarian cancer expansion cohort was presented at ASCO 2021 and the initial efficacy data does not support further development in non-clear cell ovarian cancer. The remaining three cohorts, which include non-clear cell endometrial, cervical and clear-cell ovarian and endometrial cancers, showed sufficient responses in stage one of each of the cohorts to advance to stage 2. The data from the cervical cohort have been accepted as a plenary presentation at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) 2022 Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer in March 2022 and represent encouraging data in this subset of gynecological cancers. However, given the competing priorities, 

11




including development of FAP-2286, we have determined that we will not pursue further development of lucitanib in gynecological cancers at this time. 
Bristol Myers Squibb sponsored the CheckMate 9KD (NCT03338790), a Phase 2 three-arm study in mCRPC, evaluating Opdivo + Rubraca, Opdivo + docetaxel + prednisone, and Opdivo + enzalutamide, with the objective of determining how the combinations affects objective response rate and PSA response. The study, which initiated in the fourth quarter of 2017, completed enrollment of patients with biomarker negative or positive disease, for whom tumor tissue samples were used to determine biomarker status. Bristol Myers Squibb presented data from this study at medical meetings during 2021, which showed that the combination showed clinical efficacy in a population of patients with mCRPC who are HR-deficient either pre- or post-chemotherapy, with noteworthy activity in patients harboring BRCA mutations. Clinical activity was limited in patients with HR proficient tumors. The safety profile of the combination was as expected based on the individual components, with no new safety signals, and longer follow up and potentially a comparative study is needed to better characterize the clinical benefits of adding Opdivo to rucaparib in this patient population. Ongoing biomarker analyses will further explore potential predictors of treatment benefit of the combination among patients in the post-chemotherapy population.
​
Bristol Myers Squibb sponsored FRACTION-GC (NCT02935634), a Phase 2 multi-arm study evaluating Opdivo in combination with other therapies in advanced gastric cancer. The trial includes, among other combinations, an evaluation of Opdivo + Rubraca, Yervoy + Rubraca and the triplet combination of Opdivo + Yervoy + Rubraca. While a safe and tolerable safety profile was observed for these Rubraca-containing combinations, efficacy was not demonstrated in this immunotherapy-naïve, heavily pre-treated patient population, and accordingly, the study of these combinations in this population of patients with gastroesophageal cancer is to be completed in 2022.
​
Companion Diagnostics
​
Three FDA-approved companion diagnostic tests are commercially available to select cancer patients for treatment with Rubraca. 
​
Foundation Medicine, Inc. (“Foundation”) markets its comprehensive companion diagnostic test for solid tumors, FoundationOne®CDx (“F1CDx”), a next generation sequencing-based in vitro diagnostic device for detection of substitutions, insertion and deletion alterations, and copy number alterations in 324 genes (including BRCA1/2), select gene rearrangements, as well as genomic signatures, including LOH, microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden using tumor tissue specimens. F1CDx is approved as a companion diagnostic to select ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1/2 mutations for treatment with Rubraca.
​
In August 2020, Foundation received approval for FoundationOne Liquid CDx, a qualitative next generation sequencing-based in vitro diagnostic test that analyzes mutations in 311 genes (including BRCA1/2) utilizing circulating cell-free DNA isolated from plasma derived from peripheral whole blood. FoundationOne Liquid CDx is approved as a companion diagnostic to select mCRPC and ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1/2 mutations for treatment with Rubraca.
​
BRACAnalysis CDx®, is a blood-based assay for the qualitative detection and classification of germline mutations in BRCA1/2 genes commercialized by Myriad Genetics Laboratories, Inc. BRACAnalysis CDx is approved as a companion diagnostic to select ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1/2 mutations for treatment with Rubraca.
​
FAP-2286 and Radionuclide Therapy Development Program 
​
FAP-2286 is an investigational diagnostic and therapeutic agent targeting fibroblast activation protein (“FAP”). In September 2019, we acquired U.S. and global rights to FAP-2286, excluding Europe (inclusive of Russia, Turkey and Israel), where 3B Pharmaceuticals, the discoverer of FAP-2286, retains rights. In addition to our collaboration on FAP-2286 development, we are also collaborating with 3BP on a discovery program directed to up to three additional, undisclosed targets for targeted radionuclide therapy, to which we would obtain global rights for any resulting product candidates.
​
Patent applications are pending that claim FAP-2286 generically and specifically (including with respect to composition of matter) that, if issued, would have expiration dates in 2040. 
​

The Role of Fibroblast Activation Protein as a Radiopharmaceutical Target
​
FAP is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (“CAFs”) which are found in the majority of cancer types, potentially making it a suitable target across a wide array of solid tumors. CAFs are highly prevalent in the tumor microenvironment of many cancers and persist through all malignant stages of a tumor, from primary tumor to metastasis. FAP has limited expression on normal fibroblasts, reducing the potential for effects in normal tissue. 
​
PTRT is an emerging class of drugs in oncology and involves the systemic administration of a small amount of radioactive emitting material – a radionuclide – that is conjugated to a peptide for use as a targeted pharmaceutical. The peptide is able to recognize and bind to specific targets on the cancer cells or in their microenvironment, and the intended result is to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor while sparing normal tissue because of its rapid systemic clearance. Radionuclides with different emission properties, primarily beta particles or more potent alpha particles, are used to deliver cytotoxic radiation to the tumor-associated targets. In order for the targeted radiopharmaceutical to be safe and efficacious, it must rapidly attach to cancer cells or in close vicinity to the cancer cells, be retained in or at the tumor site for a sufficient period of time that the radionuclide can have activity on the cancer cells, have minimal attachment to non-cancer cells, and then be rapidly cleared from the body. In most cases, the radionuclides may be visualized by using nuclear medicine imaging techniques to evaluate the specificity of the agent, supporting a precision medicine approach to delivery of the therapeutic form of the agent.
​
Clinical studies of small molecule imaging agents targeting FAP have validated this target in a diverse number of cancer indications and support the further evaluation of PTRT. FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals have at least two potential modes of anti-tumor activity: radiation crossfire, in which tumor cells are irradiated due to their close proximity to CAFs; and depletion of CAFs, disrupting the communication between the tumor cells and the tumor stroma. In addition, in certain tumor types, such as sarcoma and mesothelioma, FAP is expressed on the tumor cells themselves, and in those tumors, FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals may have a direct antitumor effect.
​
In addition, an evident biological rationale supports the combination of targeted radionuclide therapy with cancer therapies including PARP inhibitors and anti-PD(L)-1 agents. While our initial development focus will be on monotherapy with FAP-2286, we intend to explore these types of combinations pre-clinically and clinically as well.
​
The FAP-2286 product candidate consists of a peptide that selectively binds to FAP and a linker and site to which radioactive medical isotopes can be attached for use as an imaging agent or therapeutic agent. Our initial development plans include the use of gallium-68 (68Ga) as an imaging agent and lutetium-177 (177Lu) as a therapeutic agent.
​
The anti-tumor efficacy of 177Lu-FAP-2286 has been evaluated preclinically in FAP-expressing tumor models. Data presented at the 2020 ESMO Virtual Congress demonstrated that a single, IV dose of 177Lu-FAP-2286 resulted in statistically significant tumor growth inhibition in two different mouse xenograft models: (1) HEK293 cells stably transfected with human FAP (HEK-FAP); and (2) Sarc4809 sarcoma patient-derived xenograft model with endogenous FAP expression.
​
Nonclinical data evaluating FAP expression across a variety of solid tumor types were presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC conference in October 2021. High FAP expression was observed in multiple indications, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, cancer of unknown primary, salivary gland, mesothelioma, colon, bladder, sarcoma, squamous NSCLC, as well as squamous head and neck cancers. In these tumor types, high FAP expression was detected in both primary and metastatic tumor samples and was independent of tumor stage or grade. The analysis also demonstrated that in most tumor types, FAP expression was predominantly localized to cancer-associated fibroblasts (“CAFs”) surrounding the tumor cells and integrated into the tumor microenvironment. In addition, in cancers of mesenchymal origin including sarcoma and mesothelioma, expression was observed in tumor cells in addition to CAFs. These data support the investigation of FAP-2286 in multiple tumor types in the planned phase 2 expansion cohorts of LuMIERE. Additional presentations of nonclinical and initial presentations of clinical data are anticipated at nuclear medicine meetings during 2022.
​
First Clinical Experience Reported from FAP-2286 Named Patient Use
​
Physicians in Germany and certain other countries may treat patients suffering from life-threatening diseases or disease leading to severe disability with experimental drugs if no other appropriate options are available under named-patient or similar programs. A physician may initiate treatment for specific patients until there is commercial product 

13




available and patients are encouraged to enroll in clinical trials where possible. Named patient programs are not clinical trials and the treating physician is solely responsible for, and makes all decisions independently, including dose and assessment of efficacy and safety, and the drug sponsor has no role in decisions.
​
In December 2019, Professor Dr. Richard P. Baum reported his initial independent clinical experience with FAP-2286 in named-patient use in eleven patients at the International Centers for Precision Oncology Foundation Symposium in Bad Berka, Germany. At Prof. Dr. Baum’s clinic, FAP-2286 was linked to 68Ga as a tumor-imaging compound using PET/CT scanning and to lutetium-177 as a therapeutic agent. The data were published in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine during 2021.
​
As the early named patient use in Germany suggests, significant interest already exists within the academic community to explore the potential of FAP as an imaging and treatment target.
​
Our FAP-2286 Clinical Development Plan
​
We submitted two INDs for FAP-2286 for use as imaging and treatment agents in December 2020 to support an initial phase 1/2 study to determine the dose, schedule and tolerability of FAP-2286 as a therapeutic agent with expansion cohorts planned in multiple tumor types as part of a global development program. The FDA cleared the two INDs and we initiated the phase 1 LuMIERE clinical study in June 2021. LuMIERE is a phase 1/2 study of lutetium-177 (177Lu) labelled FAP-2286 (177Lu-FAP-2286) and is evaluating the compound in patients with advanced solid tumors. FAP-2286 gallium-68 (68Ga) labelled FAP-2286 (68Ga-FAP-2286) will be utilized to identify patients with FAP-positive tumors appropriate for treatment in this study.
​
The ongoing phase 1 portion of the LuMIERE study, for which enrollment in the second dose cohort is currently ongoing, is evaluating the safety of 177Lu-FAP-2286 and will identify the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of the investigational therapeutic agent in patients with FAP-positive tumors determined by 68Ga-FAP-2286.  Once the phase 2 dose is determined, phase 2 expansion cohorts are planned in multiple tumor types and are expected to initiate in the second half of 2022. 
​
Identification of the tumor types for exploration in phase 2 development is a considerable focus of ours, as the high levels of FAP expression observed in multiple tumor types makes selecting a limited number of tumor types in such expansion cohorts challenging. We believe we will have the opportunity to evaluate a minimum of seven tumor types in a single protocol pan-tumor study with predetermined stopping and accelerating enrollment criteria in each of these tumor types. We believe FAP-2286 provides us with the potential to seek accelerated approvals in multiple tumor types.
​
During 2022, we also anticipate the first presentations of phase 1 data from the ongoing LuMIERE study at nuclear medicine-focused meetings, as well as the launch of our combination study program to explore FAP-2286 in combination with other oncology compounds. In addition, we anticipate a potential IND filing of FAP-2286 linked the alpha-emitting radionuclide, actinium-225 (225Ac) as a distinct PTRT therapeutic during 2023.
​
In addition to our ongoing and planned studies, the University of California San Francisco is sponsoring two separate, investigator-initiated, imaging-only studies with 68Ga labeled FAP-2286. The first study, NCT04621435 investigates the utility of 68Ga-FAP-2286 to detect metastatic cancer in solid tumors. The second study, NCT05180162, evaluates the ability of 68Ga-FAP-2286 to identify pathologic fibrosis in the setting of hepatic, cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis. Both studies are currently enrolling.
​
Preclinical Evaluations
​
While we are focused clinically on FAP-2286 monotherapy development in our ongoing LuMIERE study, pre-clinically we are evaluating a number of FAP-2286 drug combinations. Cancer Discovery and Journal of Immunology have reported nonclinical studies demonstrating that FAP-expressing CAFs exert a potent immunosuppressive activity that can promote tumor progression and, according to Molecular Cancer, can confer resistance to immune-based therapies such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. We are currently evaluating the efficacy and mechanism-of-action of FAP-2286 and a PD-1 monoclonal antibody in syngeneic mouse tumor models.
​
In addition, a number of publications, including Scientific Reports, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics and Frontiers in Pharmacology, report non-clinical support for the combination of targeted radiotherapy with PARP inhibitors to 

14




augment efficacy. Radiotherapies work by causing DNA damage via radioactive emission, and if this damage is not repaired, the cell will eventually die. These nonclinical studies also report that inhibition of PARP may augment efficacy in combination with multiple TRT agents. Based on this, we are currently preclinically evaluating the combination of FAP-2286 with our PARP inhibitor, Rubraca, in tumor models.
​
Lastly, Scientific Reports, Clinical Oncology and the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging have published data showing that radiation is known to synergize with a number of agents that are currently approved as the standard-of-care in specific cancer indications. For example, Nuclear Medicine and Biology reports that gemcitabine, used as a first line chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer and other carcinomas, is a well-known radiosensitizer and could have utility in combination with FAP-2286. We are currently performing a high throughput screen of approved oncology drugs in combination with radiation to identify additional potential combinations for FAP-2286 development.
​
Lucitanib – a VEGFR, PDGFR and FGFR Inhibitor
​
Lucitanib is an investigational, oral, potent angiogenesis inhibitor which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (“VEGFR1-3”), platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (“PDGFR α/β”) and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (“FGFR1-3”).
​
The composition of matter patent for lucitanib expires in 2030 in the U.S. and 2028 in Europe, with up to five years patent term extension available. We hold the global (excluding China) development and commercialization rights for lucitanib.
​
VEGF, PDGF and FGF: The Role of these Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Cancer
​
The VEGFs are a family of related extracellular proteins that normally regulate blood and lymphatic vessel development in humans. They act by binding to and activating VEGF receptors, which are cell surface proteins that transmit growth signals to specific cells that are involved in the development of new blood vessels. Certain VEGFs promote growth of multiple solid tumors by stimulating the formation of new blood vessels to feed the tumor and allow it to grow and metastasize. Tumors produce an excessive amount of VEGF. This results in excess VEGFR signaling and the formation of new blood vessels within the tumor. The VEGF ligands that induce angiogenesis are often present in a wide range of cancer indications, including a type of kidney cancer called renal cell carcinoma, a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, head and neck cancers and other solid tumors.
​
The PDGF family consists of five different isoforms of PDGF ligand that bind to and activate cellular responses through two different receptors (PDGFRα/ß). In tumors, PDGF signaling plays a diverse role in many aspects of tumor development promoting cell proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis. Amplification and/or mutation of the gene encoding the PDGFRα receptor is observed in a wide range of cancers, including lung cancer, an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma and a cancer of the gastrointestinal tract known as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Amplification of the PDGFRα gene results in excess production, or the over-expression, of PDGFRα protein on the surface of the tumor cell. The over-expression of PDGFRα on the tumor cell surface leads to an increased receptor signaling, which stimulates uncontrolled proliferation of some types of tumor cells. 
​
The FGFs are a family of related extracellular proteins that normally regulate cell proliferation and survival in humans. The FGF family consists of 22 ligands that exert their physiological effect on cells by binding to four FGFRs (FGFR1- 4). As with the PDGF family, some cancers display FGF/FGFR gene amplification/mutation resulting in continual activation of the FGFR signaling pathway leading to uncontrolled cell division. Tumors with a relatively high incidence of FGF aberrations, which include amplification of the FGFR1 gene and amplification of a region of chromosome 11q that contains several FGF ligands, include breast and lung cancers. In addition, FGFR gene amplification/mutation is also observed in a wide range of cancer indications including sarcoma, ovarian cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer.
​
As an inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, PDGFRα/ß and FGFR1-3 and given the role that each of these receptor kinases plays in tumor progression and metastasis formation, lucitanib has the potential benefit of targeting three relevant pro-angiogenic growth factors in targeted patient populations identified by molecular markers. Data from earlier studies suggest that lucitanib’s VEGF inhibition may be the primary driver of its activity, and both preclinical and clinical data provide a scientific rationale for further development on lucitanib in combination with other agents. 
​

Targeting angiogenesis and immune checkpoint pathways may have a synergistic effect on antitumor activity. Angiogenesis has been shown to be immunosuppressive within the tumor microenvironment, dampening anti-tumor immune responses, according to Nature Reviews in Clinical Oncology (Fukumura 2018). Immune effects of angiogenesis include modulation of T-cell infiltration into the tumor, inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, and the modulation of cell adhesion molecules and immune cell populations. Inhibition of angiogenesis by small molecule RTK inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies may reverse immunosuppression. These data suggest the clinical activity of PD-(L)1 inhibitors may be enhanced through the inhibition of angiogenesis by lucitanib. Clovis preclinical studies of multiple syngeneic tumor models have shown that lucitanib in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor delivers superior activity. Multiple Phase 1-3 studies are examining the combination of angiogenesis and PD-(L)1 inhibitors in different indications.
​
Lucitanib inhibits the same three pathways as Lenvima (lenvatinib), which has shown encouraging results when combined with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab), and this combination has been approved by the FDA on an accelerated basis for the treatment of certain forms of endometrial cancer. This, together with preclinical data for lucitanib in combination with a PD(L)-1 inhibitor as described above, represent a scientific rationale for development of lucitanib in combination with a PD(L)-1 inhibitor, and in February 2019, lucitanib was added to our clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb evaluating combinations with Opdivo. 
​
LIO-1 is an open-label, Phase 1b/2 study (NCT04042116) of lucitanib in combination with Opdivo in advanced gynecologic cancers and other solid tumors to determine the recommended dose of lucitanib in combination with Opdivo in patients with an advanced solid tumor (Phase 1b); followed by evaluation of the safety and efficacy of lucitanib and Opdivo in patients with an advanced gynecological solid tumor (Phase 2), including ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers. The primary efficacy endpoint of the LIO-1 study is ORR as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. 
​
Interim data from the non-clear cell ovarian cancer expansion cohort were presented at ASCO 2021 and the initial efficacy data do not support further development in non-clear cell ovarian cancer. The remaining three cohorts, which include non-clear cell endometrial, cervical and clear-cell ovarian and endometrial cancers, showed sufficient responses in stage one of each of the cohorts to advance to stage 2. The data from the cervical cohort have been accepted as a plenary presentation at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) 2022 Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer in March 2022 and represent encouraging data in this subset of gynecological cancers. However, given the competing priorities, including development of FAP-2286, we have determined that we will not pursue further development of lucitanib in gynecological cancers at this time. 
​
Competition
​
The development and commercialization of new drugs is intensely competitive, and we face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions worldwide. Our competitors may develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that have been or will be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
​
The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive. More established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies that take similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel as well as in establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials. 
​
Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further because of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy.

​
AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc. have a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize Lynparza for multiple cancer types. Lynparza is being investigated, alone and in combination with other agents, in multiple indications across several tumor types. Multiple ovarian cancer trials with olaparib in combination with other agents are expecting data read outs in the next 12-24 months in the front-line setting (DUO-O, ENGOT-ov43) and second-line setting (MEDIOLA). In February 2022, positive data from the phase 3 mCRPC trial of olaparib+abiraterone in first line mCRPC were presented at the GU ASCO meeting. Data readouts with olaparib in combination with other agents are also expected in the next 12-24 months in mCRPC (KEYLYNK-010). New olaparib data could impair the relative value of Rubraca in the ovarian cancer and prostate space. 
​
Zejula®/niraparib (GlaxoSmithKline plc) was the first PARP inhibitor approved for maintenance in the recurrent setting and is approved in the United States in the following indications:

Government Regulation
​
Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products such as Rubraca and our other product candidates. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally placed on the market in the United States. In the European Union, a product requires approval from the European Commission (“EC”) following a favorable assessment from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) through the marketing authorization application (“MAA”) process for a product falling within the scope of the centralized procedure or a national MAA process (albeit through mutual recognition or decentralized procedure). Our product candidates will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market.
​
U.S. Government Regulation 
​
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 


● | completion of extensive non-clinical laboratory tests (evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation) and non-clinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24





● | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated at least annually;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a marketing authorization application in the form of an NDA for the initial commercial sale of a product, or of a sNDA, for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer a product candidate to humans for further research of the drug candidate’s safety and/or efficacy. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan for the drug candidate and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the product candidate. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold requiring delay of a proposed clinical investigation, and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
​
Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. Clinical trials are subject to central registration and results reporting requirements, such as on www.clinicaltrials.gov.
​
The clinical investigation of a product candidate is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows: 


● | Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of the product candidate into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the product candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.

● | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25





● | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants.

​
A pivotal study is a clinical study which adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may be Phase 2 studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. 
​
Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA, an IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (“IDMC”). The IDMC receives special access to un-blinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
​
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed product development information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or sNDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. 
​
The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results, as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
​
Once the marketing application submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within 10 months of acceptance for filing or, if the sponsor has been granted priority review designation, on the basis of an improvement in the treatments of a serious condition, six months from acceptance for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
​
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or sNDA and conducts inspections of clinical research facilities and/or manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. 
​

26




Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. 
​
Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for quality and compliance, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidance. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observations(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
​
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
​
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
​
Regardless of whether we hold FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
​
Medicines can be authorized in the EU by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. Under the centralized procedure, marketing authorization applications are submitted to the EMA whose CHMP reviews the application and issues an opinion on it. The opinion is considered by the EC which is responsible for deciding applications. If the application is approved, the EC grants a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including cancer.
​
The national authorization procedures, the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, are available for products for which the centralized procedure is not compulsory. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
​
As result of the United Kingdom (“UK”) leaving the EU, the UK is no longer part of the harmonized EU medicines network. The UK government introduced legislation to allow the continued registration, sale and access to medicinal 

27




products including regulation to allow implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. A comprehensive national regime for the authorization of medicinal products for human use; for the manufacture, import, distribution, sale and supply of those products; for their labelling and advertising; and for pharmacovigilance have been introduced. In Northern Ireland the, EU regulations will continue to apply in accordance with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
​
Available Special Regulatory Procedures 
​
Formal Meetings 
​
We are encouraged to engage and seek guidance from health authorities relating to the development and review of investigational drugs, as well as marketing applications. In the United States, there are different types of official meetings that may occur between us and the FDA. Each meeting type is subject to different procedures. Conclusions and agreements from each of these meetings are captured in the official final meeting minutes issued by the FDA. 
​
The EMA also provides the opportunity for dialogue with us. This is usually done in the form of Scientific Advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of CHMP. A fee is incurred with each Scientific Advice meeting. 
​
Advice from either the FDA or EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Such advice is not legally binding on the sponsor. To obtain binding commitments from the FDA in the United States, Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) procedures are available. A SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement with the sponsor that the protocol design, clinical endpoints and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. The FDA’s agreement to a SPA is binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical studies begin, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to a SPA. 
​
Orphan Drug Designation 
​
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product. 
​
In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 
​
In Europe, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
​
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
​

28




Pediatric Development 
​
In the United States, the FDCA provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity for a drug if reports are filed of investigations studying the use of the drug product in a pediatric population in response to a written request from the FDA. Separate from this potential exclusivity benefit, NDAs must contain data (or a proposal for post-marketing activity) to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. Discussions about pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end-of-Phase II meeting and submission of the NDA. 
​
For the EMA, a Pediatric Investigation Plan, and/or a request for waiver or deferral, has to be agreed prior to submitting an initial marketing authorization application and prior to submitting a variation to an existing Marketing Authorization to add an additional indication. 
​
Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the United States
​
The U.S. Congress created the Breakthrough Therapy designation program as a result of the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012. FDA may grant Breakthrough Therapy status to a drug intended for the treatment of a serious condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The Breakthrough Therapy designation, which may be requested by a sponsor when filing or amending an IND, is intended to facilitate and expedite the development and FDA review of a product candidate. Specifically, the Breakthrough Therapy designation may entitle the sponsor to more frequent meetings with the FDA during drug development, intensive guidance on clinical trial design and expedited FDA review by a cross-disciplinary team comprised of senior managers. The designation does not guarantee a faster development or review time as compared to other drugs, however, nor does it assure that the drug will obtain ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. Once granted, the FDA may withdraw this designation at any time. 
​
Expedited Review and Approval in the United States 
​
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and biologics, and/or provide for the approval of a drug or biologic on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from the 60-day filing date, if the drug is a new molecular entity, rather than to the standard FDA review period of 10 months. Priority review is granted where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
​
Fast Track is a designation which is more similar to the Breakthrough Therapy designation, but is granted based on preliminary data including non-clinical or mechanistic data, and allows more frequent communication with FDA to expedite drug development
​
Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and is better than available therapy. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. The FDA will also consider the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition. As a condition of approval for drugs granted accelerated approval, one or more post-marketing confirmatory studies are required to confirm as 

29




predicted by the surrogate marker trial an effect on clinical benefit, which is defined as having a positive effect on how a patient feels, functions or survives. 
​
Accelerated Review in the European Union
​
Under the Centralized Procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g. heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days of submission of the MAA, excluding clock stops. 
​
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
​
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of Rubraca and any other drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of approved pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, public and private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved or European Commission/specific country-approved drugs for a particular indication (or all indications for an approved drug). Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain approvals. In any event, our approved products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be established. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Third-party payors impose price protection in their contracts with manufacturers to limit the manufacturer’s ability to increase price in exchange of providing equal access to the drug product vs. other competing drugs. 
​
The prescription drug benefit administered by the United States government provides it with certain cost containment tools. The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit works as a public sector-private sector partnership, whereby Medicare Part D prescription drug plans receive funding from the Federal Medicare program, which they use to pay pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D enrollees. The Part D prescription drug plans seek to contain costs by contracting with manufacturers which pay rebates in exchange for favorable formulary placement. Anti-cancer agents currently have guaranteed favorable status on these formularies, but the Medicare program can remove that status, which would result in higher rebate payments. Even with the current, guaranteed favorable formulary placement, we must still pay some portion of patient expenses when they enter into the coverage gap period referred to as the “donut hole.” We participate in this Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program because it is a precondition to Medicare Part D coverage for our products.
​
There is some uncertainty as to our arrangements with commercial pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, going forward. In November 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a Final Rule that would, effective January 1, 2026, eliminate the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to PBMs on behalf of such plans. While we cannot anticipate the effects of this change to the way it currently contracts, this new framework could significantly alter the way it does business with Part D plan sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans. This rulemaking also established, effective January 1, 2021, a new safe harbor for point-of-sale discounts at the pharmacy counter and a new safe harbor for certain services arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs. Most of our current contracts do not meet the requirements that will go into effect in 2026. We may incur costs renegotiating these agreements, and their terms may be less favorable.
​

30




The US Federal government is continuing to seek other cost containment tools. In legislation that had previously been introduced in 2021 as part of the Build Back Better Act (the “BBBA”), there were provisions that would have allowed the Federal government to negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs covered under Medicare Parts A and B. More broadly, all drugs would have been subject to inflation penalties if their costs rise faster than inflation. Although the BBBA has not passed, some portions of the bill are likely to be included in other laws that may be more successful.
​
Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that federal, state and local governments in the United States will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as our products.
 ​
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may be subject to the impact that government and third-party coverage and reimbursement decisions have on patients. Increasing coinsurance responsibilities can dissuade patients from receiving medications, including our products. To offset the impact of coinsurance on patient adherence, we offer copay assistance to patients not covered by United States federal healthcare programs. However, the Medicare program has implemented a new rule that would cause a significant increase in our rebates to state Medicaid programs resulting from the continued provision of copay assistance to patients. That rule takes effect on January 1, 2023, unless a lawsuit by PhRMA against the Medicare program is successful. We may need to evaluate offering coinsurance support if the rule goes into effect, which would be very detrimental to medication adherence.
​
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries and vary widely from country to country. In Europe, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund the cost of those products to consumers. These jurisdictions operate a system under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed for a defined population that, depending on country-specific negotiations, could be equal to European Commission-granted indication or a restricted population. To obtain reimbursement and pricing approval in Europe, some of these European countries may require additional economic evidence, referred to as a health technology assessment (HTA). In European countries, repeating price/reimbursement negotiations take place depending on local healthcare situations and can lead to lower reimbursed prices over time.
​
The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasing high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, especially in Europe, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. In particular, for each new indication, new negotiations are required to obtain reimbursement in European countries; also, pricing negotiations in European countries are often linked to baskets of comparator countries; due to Brexit, it is currently unclear whether changes in country baskets will take place anytime soon. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in Europe do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. Additionally, European Union competition laws allow the parallel importation of branded drugs between member countries. This allows buyers in countries where government-approved prices for Rubraca are relatively high to purchase it from countries where the prices for Rubraca are relatively low. Purchases of Rubraca in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high may impact our overall margins on Rubraca and thereby negatively affect our earnings.
​
​
Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time in the United States and Europe. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.

​
Advertising and Promotion
​
The FDA and other U.S. federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, the FDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations and standards. The FDA’s review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, communications regarding unapproved or “off-label” uses, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions regarding unapproved uses of a drug or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations, may result in adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. A range of penalties are possible that could have significant commercial consequences, including product seizures, injunctions, administrative remedies, civil and/or criminal fines, agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes its products, or regulatory enforcement letters which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals or consumers.
​
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
​
We are subject to various laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including federal and state anti-kickback laws and false-claims laws. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and administrative remedies such as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim submitted in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
​
The federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal program, including federal healthcare programs. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil fines and penalties. 
​
In addition, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of co-payments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid-payable items or services, may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $20,000 for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the federal Anti-kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties. One of the statutory exceptions to this prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services emphasizes, however, that this exception should 

32




only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud. To the extent our patient assistance programs are found to be inconsistent with applicable laws, we may be required to restructure or discontinue such programs or be subject to significant penalties.
​
In addition to the laws described above, drug manufacturers must report to CMS payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information to CMS may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $178,581 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.190 million per year for “knowing failures”), adjusted for inflation, for all payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Applicable drug manufacturers are required to collect data for each calendar year and submit reports to CMS by March 31st of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, there is also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws impose administrative and compliance burdens that may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities.
​
For marketed products which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid program, we have various obligations, including government price calculation and reporting and rebate requirements which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the execution of government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The guidance governing such calculations is not always clear and may require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources in order to comply. Failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties. 
​
One component of the rebate and discount calculations under the Medicaid and 340B programs is the “additional rebate”, a complex calculation which is based, in part, on the rate at which a branded drug’s price increases over time as compared to the rate of inflation (based on the CPI-U published by the United States Department of Labor). This calculation is based on the baseline pricing data for the first full quarter of sales associated with a branded drug’s NDA, and baseline data cannot generally be reset, even on transfer of the NDA to another manufacturer. This “additional rebate” calculation can, in some cases where price increases have been relatively high versus the first quarter of sales of the NDA, result in Medicaid rebates up to 100% of a drug’s “average manufacturer price” and 340B prices of one penny. Separately, subject to the control of Directive 89/105/EEC, pricing and reimbursement in the EU/EEA (“European Economic Area”) is governed by national rules and policies and may vary from Member State to Member State.
​
Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) outlines several federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. Most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
​
The privacy and protection of consumer information remains a developing area and we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments both in the United States as well as Europe. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) became effective on January 1, 2020 and, as enacted, requires us to make new disclosures to consumers about our data collection, use, and sharing practices. It also provides a cause of action for data breaches. Beyond California, many other states are developing their own data privacy protections, which, along with the CCPA, could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), the U.K.’s Data Protection Act 2018 and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act and Data Protection Ordinance, regulate the processing of personal data within the U.K., the EU and between countries in the EU, U.K. and countries outside of the EU and U.K., including the U.S. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with the EU, U.K. and Swiss Privacy Laws, could jeopardize business transactions 

33




across borders and result in significant penalties. Similar to the impact of the CCPA or other U.S. state frameworks, these European laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business.
​
Regulation of Diagnostic Tests 
​
In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, non-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Diagnostic tests are classified as medical devices under the FDCA. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution, depending on their classification by FDA. 
​
In the United States, devices are classified into one of three classes (Class I, II, or III) based on the controls deemed necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I and II devices are subject to general controls including, but not limited to, performance standards, premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and post market surveillance. Class III devices are those that either support or sustains human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Class III devices are subject to more rigorous review and approval requirements than Class I or II, known as a premarket approval, or PMA approval. Because the diagnostic tests being developed by our third-party collaborators are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, they are considered Class III devices, subject to the PMA approval process.
​
PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, non-clinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
​
We and our third-party collaborators who are developing companion diagnostics work cooperatively to generate the data required for submission with a PMA application and the diagnostic partner is responsible for maintaining close contact with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”) at the FDA to ensure that any changes in requirements are incorporated into the development plans. Meetings with the FDA with regard to our drug product candidates, as well as companion diagnostic product candidates, typically include representatives from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and CDRH when appropriate to ensure that the NDA and PMA submissions are coordinated to enable FDA to conduct a parallel review of both submissions. The FDA has issued guidance documents addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to these guidance documents, for novel therapeutic products such as our product candidates, the PMA for a companion diagnostic device should generally be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. In order to achieve this, the diagnostic may be subject to post approval study requirements.
​
In the EU, Regulation EU 2017/746 introduced substantial changes to the regulatory framework for In-Vitro Diagnostics starting on May 26, 2022. The regulation introduces certain requirements for In Vitro Diagnostics and a stronger role for so-called conformity assessment bodies. Conformity assessment bodies (so-called ‘notified bodies') will independently monitor whether devices comply with the safety and performance requirements before they reach the EU market. In order to prevent disruption of supply of essential healthcare products, especially in the context of the COVID-

34




19 pandemic, the European Commission agreed a progressive roll-out of the regulation. The date of application of some aspects of the regulation requirements has been amended according to the risk category of the device. 
​
No change is proposed for CE-marked devices that do not require notified body involvement under the IVD Regulation, or for devices that are “new” (i.e., devices that have neither a notified body certificate nor a declaration of conformity under the current Directive 98/79/EC). For those types of devices, the IVD Regulation will apply starting on May 26, 2022. The data generated for the U.S. PMA registration will likely be sufficient to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the EU and other countries.
​
Patents and Proprietary Rights
​
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, technology and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and other technology. Our policy is to patent or in-license the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
 ​
In June 2011, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from Pfizer to develop and commercialize rucaparib. In April 2012, we obtained an exclusive license from AstraZeneca under a family of patents and patent applications which permits the development and commercialization of rucaparib for certain methods of treating patients with PARP inhibitors. 
​
We were granted patent term extension to November 22, 2023 under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) for U.S. Patent 6,495,541 directed to the rucaparib composition of matter. Additionally, other patents and patent applications are directed to methods of making, methods of using, dosing regimens, various salt and polymorphic forms, and formulations with expiration dates through potentially 2035. These patents and patent applications include the rucaparib camsylate salt/polymorph patent family licensed from Pfizer, which expires in 2031, and a patent family directed to high dosage strength rucaparib tablets, which expires in 2035. To date, the rucaparib camsylate salt/polymorph patents issued in 53 jurisdictions (including the United States and Europe), with applications pending in 4 jurisdictions. Patents directed to the high dosage strength rucaparib tablets, including all commercial dosage strengths, issued in the United States and 6 other jurisdictions, and applications are pending in 12 jurisdictions, including before the European Patent Office. United States patents with claims that cover Rubraca and its uses are listed in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. 
​
Because Rubraca does not contain a previously approved active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a five-year period of new chemical entity (“NCE”) exclusivity following its December 19, 2016 approval during which time generic competitors cannot file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) for a generic version of Rubraca, unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV Certification that one or more patents listed in the Orange Book for Rubraca are invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by a proposed ANDA product, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original drug approval. That is, under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, December 19, 2020 was the earliest date that a generic competitor could submit an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to market a generic version of Rubraca. Since that time, generic entities have been permitted to file an ANDA for rucaparib with a Paragraph IV certification asserting that one or more patents listed in the Orange Book for Rubraca are either not infringed, invalid, or not enforceable. We have not received any Paragraph IV certification notice letters, and to our knowledge, no ANDA filings for rucaparib have been made to date. In March 2021, the FDA issued revised draft product-specific guidance for industry on rucaparib camsylate that replaces the guidance previously issued in February 2018. Because rucaparib camsylate is considered a cytotoxic drug, the published FDA guidance requires any party seeking approval for a generic form of rucaparib to file a Bio-IND and recommends showing bioequivalence in “female patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation associated with advanced cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and are receiving a regimen of rucaparib camsylate.” The guidance sets forth additional criteria, including the demonstration of bioequivalence to a 90 percent confidence interval. Demonstrating bioequivalence with 

35




Rubraca would only be an initial step in the ANDA approval process. In a potential ANDA litigation, a generic challenger would also need to successfully challenge or design around Orange Book listed patents, some of which do not expire until 2035. If a Paragraph IV Certification is made, the generic company is required to provide a Paragraph IV Notice Letter advising Clovis of the certification. If that occurs, Clovis will have the opportunity to bring a patent infringement action against the generic company. If such a suit is filed within the 45-day period following receipt of the Paragraph IV Notice Letter, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a 30-month stay on FDA’s ability to grant final approval of the proposed generic product. The 30-month stay generally runs from the date the Paragraph IV Notice Letter is received. The 30-month stay may be shortened or lengthened, including due to a settlement of a lawsuit, a court order (including a decision by the district court on the merits of the case), or patent expiration.
​
Two European patents in the rucaparib camsylate salt/polymorph patent family (European Patent 2534153 and its divisional European Patent 3150610) were opposed. In particular, opposition notices against European Patent 2534153 were filed by two parties on June 20, 2017. During an oral hearing that took place on December 4, 2018, the European Patent Office’s Opposition Division maintained European Patent 2534153 in amended and narrowed form with claims to certain crystalline forms of rucaparib camsylate, including, but not limited to, rucaparib S-camsylate Form A, the crystalline form in Rubraca. Clovis and one opponent, Hexal AG, appealed the written decision of the European Opposition Division and filed reply appeal briefs in November 2019. An oral hearing in the appeal is scheduled on December 8, 2022. 
​
An opposition against European Patent 3150610 was filed by Generics (UK) Limited on April 30, 2020 on grounds similar to those raised in the opposition notices against European Patent 2534153, which grounds are common in such proceedings. Clovis responded to the opposition notice in European Patent 3150610 by amending the claims to be directed to the use of rucaparib maleate in a method of inhibiting PARP activity or treating cancer. That is, the amended claims do not cover Rubraca. During an oral hearing that took place on November 18, 2021, European Patent 3150610 was revoked and the written decision of the European Patent Office was dated December 15, 2021. Clovis filed a notice of appeal on January 28, 2022 and an appeal brief before April 25, 2022. During the appeal, the effect of the Opposition Division’s decision is suspended, and the patent remains in force until a Technical Board of Appeals issues its own decision.

We have filed for patent term extension under a supplementary protection certificate for Rubraca based on European Patent 2534153 and believe that extension could be available to 2033. Additionally, in Europe, regulatory exclusivity is available for ten years, plus one year for a new indication; therefore, we have regulatory exclusivity for Rubraca, including all forms of rucaparib, in Europe until 2028, and if the EMA approves a subsequent indication that brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies, until 2029.
​
We obtained rights to lucitanib by acquiring EOS in November 2013, along with its license agreement with Advenchen. We have rights to develop and commercialize lucitanib on a global basis, excluding China. Composition of matter and method of use patent protection for lucitanib and a group of structurally-related compounds is issued in the United States, Europe, and Japan and is issued or pending in other jurisdictions. In the United States, the composition of matter patent will expire in 2030, and in other jurisdictions, it expires in 2028. We believe that patent term extension could be available to extend our composition of matter patent up to five years beyond the scheduled expiration under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States, and similar provisions in other jurisdictions. Additionally, patents directed to methods of manufacturing lucitanib are issued in the United States, Europe and China. 
​
In September 2019, we acquired rights from 3BP to develop and commercialize a peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy (“PTRT”) and imaging agent targeting fibroblast activation protein (“FAP”), including FAP-2286. We hold global development rights, and U.S. and global commercialization rights, excluding Europe (inclusive of Russia, Turkey and Israel), where 3BP retains rights. Patent applications are pending that claim FAP-2286 generically and specifically (including with respect to composition of matter) that, if issued, would have expiration dates in 2040.
​
In addition, we intend to seek patent protection whenever available for any products or product candidates and related technology we acquire in the future. 
​
The patent positions of pharmaceutical firms like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of the product candidates we acquire, or license will gain patent protection or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, 

36




circumvented or invalidated. Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, until that time we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“U.S. PTO”) to determine priority of invention or in opposition or other third-party proceedings in the U.S. or a foreign patent office, either of which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that the patents, if issued, would be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome in a third-party patent dispute could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using specific compounds or technology. 
​
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries or jurisdictions in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. PTO in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. 
​
The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. 
​
To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights. These types of proceedings are often costly and could be very time-consuming to us, and we cannot assure you that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor. An unfavorable decision could allow third parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees or may compel us to license needed technologies to a third-party. Such a decision could even result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications. To the extent prudent, we intend to bring litigation against third parties that we believe are infringing one or more of our patents.
​
In addition, we have sought and intend to continue seeking orphan drug status whenever it is available. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in certain very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for an indication. 
​
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. However, we believe that the substantial costs and resources required to develop technological innovations will help us to protect the competitive advantage of our products. 
​
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 
​

Manufacturing
​
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for commercial use, or non-clinical studies and clinical trials and intend to do so in the future. We currently have long-term agreements with third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the production of the active ingredient and final product for Rubraca. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of commercial and clinical quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, we are working with our current third-party suppliers to ensure sufficient capacity to meet our manufacturing requirements. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers.
​
We have developed the process for manufacturing Rubraca’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) to a degree sufficient to meet clinical demands and projected commercial requirements. Manufacturing of Rubraca API is being performed by Lonza Ltd (“Lonza”). Manufacturing operations for an advanced intermediate, which is the inventory prior to conversion to API, was expanded to a second Lonza site during 2019. The Rubraca drug product formulation and manufacturing process to produce that formulation have been developed to a degree sufficient to meet clinical demands and projected commercial requirements. A single third-party CMO capable of both formulation development and drug product manufacturing is currently producing the Rubraca drug product.
​
To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements and we expect them to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands.
​
Lonza Agreement - Rubraca
​
On October 3, 2016, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Lonza for the long-term manufacture and supply of the API for rucaparib. Under this agreement, Lonza is a non-exclusive manufacturer of the Rubraca API during the 10-year term of the agreement. Lonza constructed, in an existing Lonza facility, a production train to manufacture of the Rubraca API. The production train provides manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs for commercial supply of Rubraca API. We made scheduled capital program fee payments toward capital equipment and other costs associated with the construction of the production train. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, once the facility was operational, we were obligated to pay a fixed facility fee each quarter for the duration of the Agreement, which expires on December 31, 2025, unless extended by mutual consent of the parties.
​
At the time we entered into the Agreement, we evaluated the Agreement as a whole and bifurcated into lease and non-lease components, which consisted of an operating lease of warehouse space, financial lease of equipment, purchase of leasehold improvements and prepaid manufacturing costs based upon the relative fair values of each of the deliverables. During October 2018, the production train was placed into service and we recorded the various components of the Agreement.
​
On June 16, 2021, we entered into amendment no. 2 of the Agreement with Lonza (“Amendment 2”). Pursuant to the terms of Amendment 2, we paid Lonza $1.1 million to repurpose the production train so that Lonza will be able to use the facility to manufacture other products for third parties in addition to API for Clovis. Lonza is guaranteeing a minimum percentage usage of this production train for third parties and Lonza would reduce our fixed facility fee starting in 2023 based on this minimum percentage usage. If Lonza is able to utilize greater than the minimum guaranteed percentage, it will increase the reduction to our fixed facility fee. 
​
Either party may terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the agreement by the other party, subject to prior written notice and a cure period. We may terminate the agreement, subject to 90 days’ prior written notice, in the event Rubraca is withdrawn from the market for certain reasons. In the event of such a termination by us, or termination by Lonza due to material breach by us, we are obligated to compensate Lonza for any services rendered, or for which costs have been incurred by Lonza in anticipation of services to be provided to us, and to pay to Lonza the remaining amount of any capital program fees and quarterly fixed facility fees for the remainder of the term of the agreement. In the event we terminate the agreement due to material breach by Lonza, Lonza is obligated to repay all or a portion of the capital program fees previously paid by us.

FAP-2286
​
The precursor (API without radionuclide) for FAP-2286 is currently being produced by a CMO. To date, the current production process has been sufficient to satisfy immediate clinical demands. We may undertake additional development work to further optimize the precursor manufacturing process. The finished drug product for 177Lu -FAP-2286 is currently being manufactured at a CMO. The current product and process are sufficiently developed to meet immediate clinical demands. Additional scale-up work and/or additional production capacity will be necessary to support larger clinical development or commercialization requirements. 
​
In October 2021, we entered into a clinical supply agreement with ITM Isotope Technologies Munich SE that provides us with ITM’s therapeutic radioisotope no-carrier-added 177Lu, EndolucinBeta®, for use in the clinical development of FAP-2286 for the next five years.
​
Lucitanib
​
The API for lucitanib is currently being produced by a CMO. To date, the current production process has been sufficient to satisfy immediate clinical demands. We may undertake additional development work to further optimize the active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing process. The finished drug product for lucitanib is currently being manufactured at a CMO. The current product and process are sufficiently developed to meet immediate clinical demands. Additional scale-up work and/or additional production capacity will be necessary to support larger clinical development or commercialization requirements. 
​
Commercial Operations
​
Our commercial organizations in the U.S. and Europe are in place and supporting the commercial sale of Rubraca. We believe the oncology market for Rubraca is addressable with a targeted sales and marketing organization, with capabilities that include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, oncology group networks and government accounts. We sell Rubraca through a limited distribution network consisting of select number of specialty pharmacies and distributors. Healthcare providers prescribe Rubraca to patients and the specialty pharmacies and distributors dispense Rubraca directly to patients. We intend to continue promoting Rubraca ourselves for its current indications and any additional indications we may obtain in the future. We retain the rights to Rubraca in the rest of the world. 
​
In October 2020, we adopted a new U.S. commercial strategy to address a challenging sales environment resulting from a trend toward reduced in-person access for oncology commercial teams to oncology practices in general, which has been further accelerated by COVID-19, which has severely limited oncology patient visits and cancer diagnoses. Physicians increasingly prefer digital communications and virtual peer-to-peer interactions which they can access when they choose. The new hybrid strategy elevates digital programming, virtual communication and peer-to-peer interactions while reducing in-person promotion, and the remaining in-person activities will be much more targeted. This hybrid strategy does not require as large a U.S. commercial organization, and in early November 2020 the size of the organization was reduced to approximately 85 employees. 
​
Customers 
​
We are currently approved to sell Rubraca in the U.S. and Europe markets. We distribute our product principally through a limited number of specialty distributor and specialty pharmacy providers, collectively, our customers. Our customers subsequently sell our products to patients and health care providers. We do not believe the loss of one of these customers would significantly impact the ability to distribute our product as we expect that sales volume would be absorbed evenly by the remaining customers. Separately, we have arrangements with certain payors and other third parties that provide for government-mandated and privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts.
​
Employees
​
As of February 17, 2022, we had 413 employees, of which 278 were employed in the U.S. and 135 were employed outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions, and a very small number of international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
​

Our success depends upon our ability to retain and attract highly qualified management and technical personnel. Talent management is critical to our ability to execute on our long-term growth strategy. We appreciate the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees. We continue to be committed to an inclusive culture which values equality, opportunity and respect. In support of our inclusive culture, we believe we offer competitive compensation and benefits, including an annual pay gap assessment; provide respectful workplace training to strengthen employee understanding; and strive to recruit a diverse talent pool across all levels of the organization.
​
Employee safety and wellbeing is of paramount importance to us in any year and was of particular focus in our fiscal years 2020 and 2021 in light of COVID-19. In response to the pandemic, we provided productivity and collaboration tools and resources for employees working remotely, including training and toolkits to help leaders effectively lead and manage remote teams. In addition, throughout 2021 we continued to enhance and promote programs to support our employees’ physical and mental wellbeing.
