ITEM 1. BUSINESS

First person pronouns used in this Report, such as “we,” “us,” and “our,” refer to ICU Medical, Inc. ("ICU") and its subsidiaries unless context requires otherwise.
Company Background and Overview of Business
    ICU is one of the world's leading pure-play infusion therapy companies with global operations and a wide-ranging product portfolio that includes IV solutions, IV smart pumps with pain management and safety software technology, dedicated and nondedicated IV sets and needlefree connectors designed to help meet clinical, safety and workflow goals. In addition, ICU manufactures automated pharmacy IV compounding systems with workflow technology, closed system transfer devices for preparing and administering hazardous IV drugs and cardiac monitoring systems for critically ill patients.
    Headquartered in San Clemente, California, ICU was founded in 1984. In 1992, we had our initial public offering and reincorporated under Delaware law. Our primary customers are acute care hospitals, wholesalers, ambulatory clinics and alternate site facilities, such as outpatient clinics, home health care providers, and long-term care facilities. Since our inception we have grown organically and through acquisition, and we currently serve customers in more than 90 countries around the world.
    In February 2017, we acquired Pfizer Inc.'s ("Pfizer") Hospira Infusion Systems ("HIS") business. The HIS acquisition complemented our legacy non-dedicated infusion sets and oncology business by expanding our product portfolio to include a complete intravenous infusion therapy product-line from IV solutions to IV pumps to non-dedicated infusion sets. 
    In November 2019, we acquired Pursuit Vascular, Inc. ("Pursuit"). Pursuit was a privately-held medical device company with a primary focus on innovative catheter disinfecting products and technologies to reduce costly bloodstream infections and lower healthcare costs. Pursuit’s primary product is the ClearGuard® HD cap, which is used for the maintenance of hemodialysis catheters. 
Products
    Our primary product offerings are listed below, which we present in four product lines as follows:
Infusion Consumables
Infusion therapy sets, used in hospitals and ambulatory clinics, consist of a tube running from a bottle or plastic bag containing a solution to a catheter inserted in a patient’s vein, that may or may not be used with an IV pump. Our primary IV Consumable products are:
•Clave™ needlefree products, including the MicroClave, MicroClave Clear, and NanoClave™ brand of connectors, accessories, extension and administration sets used for the administration of IV fluids and medications and the Neutron catheter patency device, used to help maintain patency of central venous catheters;
•SwabCap disinfecting cap, used to protect and disinfect any needlefree connector, including competitive brands of connectors; 
•ClearGuard HD antimicrobial barrier caps for hemodialysis catheters; and
•TegoTM hemodialysis connector used to cap and protect hemodialysis central venous catheter hubs.
    Closed System Transfer Devices ("CSTD") and hazardous drug compounding systems are used to prepare and deliver hazardous IV medications such as those used in chemotherapy, which, if released, can have harmful effects to the healthcare worker and environment. Our products are:
•ChemoLockTM CSTD which utilizes a proprietary needlefree connection method, is used for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. ChemoLock is used to limit the escape of hazardous drug or vapor 
concentrations, block the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system, and eliminates the risk of needlestick injury;
•ChemoClaveTM, an ISO Connection standard and universally compatible CSTD used for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. ChemoClave utilizes standard ISO luer locking connections, making it compatible with all brands of needlefree connectors and pump delivery systems. ChemoClave also is used to limit the escape of hazardous drug or vapor concentrations, block the transfer of environmental contaminants into the system, and eliminate the risk of needlestick injury; and
•DianaTM hazardous drug compounding system, an automated sterile compounding system that incorporates ChemoClave and ChemoLock CSTD consumables and IV workflow technology for the accurate, safe, and efficient preparation of hazardous drugs. It is a user-controlled automated system that provides repeatable accuracy of drug mixes and minimizes clinician exposure to hazardous drugs while helping to maintain the sterility of the drugs being mixed.
The preparation of hazardous drugs typically takes place in a pharmacy where drugs are removed from vials and prepared for delivery to a patient. Those prepared drugs are then transferred to a nursing unit where the chemotherapy is administered via an infusion pump set to a patient. Components of the ChemoClave and ChemoLock product lines are used both in pharmacies and on the nursing floors for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. 
Infusion Systems
    We offer a wide range of infusion pumps, dedicated IV sets and software. Our primary Infusion System products are dedicated IV sets and the following:

    Financial information relating to our reporting segment and primary product lines is set forth in Part I, Item 6. "Selected Financial Data" and Item 7. "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Manufacturing

    As of December 31, 2020, we operate four primary manufacturing facilities globally, which are discussed in Part I, Item 2 of this report. We operate four main service centers globally. We also rely on certain outside manufacturers for certain product lines in Infusion Systems and IV Solutions.
    Our four primary manufacturing sites are:
•La Aurora de Heredia, Costa Rica, which manufactures most of our infusion pumps and dedicated disposables, as well as a portion of our non-dedicated infusion consumables products; 
•Ensenada, Mexico, which manufactures infusion consumables products;
•Salt Lake City, Utah, which produces primarily our proprietary brands of connector and CSTD components, and sends those products to Costa Rica or Mexico for finished goods assembly; and
•Austin, Texas, which produces our IV Solutions products. 
    Additionally, we leverage a long-term supply agreement with Pfizer (described below) to provide additional IV Solution products to us.
We have four main regional device service centers in Sligo, Ireland; San Laurent, Quebec, Canada; Taipei, Taiwan and Rydalmere, Australia. 
    In 2017, we entered into two Manufacturing and Supply Agreements ("MSAs") with Pfizer under which, (i) Pfizer manufactures and supplies us with certain agreed upon products for an initial five-year term with a one-time two-year option to extend and (ii) we manufacture and supply Pfizer certain agreed upon products for a term of five or ten years depending on the product, with a one-time two-year option to extend. The initial supply price will be annually updated and is in full consideration for all costs associated with the manufacture, documentation, packaging and certification of the products.
    We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. We work closely with our 
suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components.
Sales, Marketing and Administration

We ship around the world with the majority of our sales denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and Canadian dollars. We are not dependent on any single customer.
Distribution 
    Our products are marketed to medical product manufacturers, independent distributors and directly to end users.
    The U.S. distribution of solutions, IV sets and accessories is supported by a network of two owned and one leased distribution centers, which include King of Prussia, Pennsylvania; Los Angeles, California; and Dallas, Texas. We also utilize a number of public warehouses as part of our supply chain.
    Internationally, we manage distribution by utilizing international regional hubs and through independent distributors.
Government Regulation

    Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and other federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices and combination drug/device products in the U.S. to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. The Federal Trade Commission also regulates the advertising of our products. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training and other practices to government scrutiny. 
U.S. Device Classification and Clearance
    Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDC Act") also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a pre-market approval ("PMA") application. 
    Under the 510(k) process, applicants must demonstrate to the FDA that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device, the “predicate” device. Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.
    In the PMA application process, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices, and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose, and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation ("QSR"). For novel technologies, the FDA will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process, though both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. 
Drug Regulation in the U.S. 
    In the U.S., IV solutions are considered pharmaceutical products and subject to the same extensive pre- and post-market regulations by the FDA, as indicated above.
    The pre-market approval process is a time-intensive multi-phased process. When successfully completed an application may be submitted to the FDA that includes detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. This application process may be subject to substantial fees. 
    FDA approval is typically required before any new drug can be marketed. A New Drug Application ("NDA"), or an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"), is typically required to be submitted to the FDA to obtain approval of pharmaceutical products. 
    Before approval, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements. 
Post-Approval Regulation
     After the FDA permits a drug or device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. The FDA actively monitors regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA can take action against a company that promotes "off-label" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDC Act and regulations pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals, and could results in a substantial modification to the company's business practices and operations.           
Manufacturing Regulation
    We must also comply with FDA, International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) and European Community ("EC") Directives and regulations such as the Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the "Medical Device Directive") and Regulation 2017/745 (the "Medical Device Regulation") governing medical device manufacturing practices. The FDA, state, foreign agencies and ISO require manufacturers to register and subject manufacturers to periodic FDA, state, foreign agencies and ISO inspections of their manufacturing facilities. We are a FDA and ISO registered medical device manufacturer, and must demonstrate that we and our contract manufacturers comply with the FDA’s QSR and cGMPs. The FDA and regulatory agencies outside the U.S. monitor compliance with these requirements through inspections of manufacturing facilities. If an inspector observes conditions that might be violative, the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily, or face potential regulatory action that might include physical removal of the product from the marketplace.

We believe that our products and procedures are in compliance with all applicable FDA and international regulations.  There is no assurance, however, that other products we are developing or products that we may develop in the future will be cleared by the FDA and classified as Class II products, or that additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the FDA. In addition, changes in FDA, ISO or other federal or state health, environmental or safety regulations or their applications could adversely affect our business.
    To market our products in the EC, we must conform to additional requirements of the EC and demonstrate conformance to established quality standards and applicable directives. As a manufacturer that designs, manufactures and markets its own devices, we must comply with the quality management standards of EN ISO 13485. Those quality standards are similar to the QSR regulations.

    To market our products in the EC, manufacturers of medical devices must also conform to EC Directives and regulations such as the Medical Device Directive and the Medical Device Regulation and their applicable annexes. Those regulations assure that medical devices are both safe and effective and meet all applicable established standards prior to being marketed in the EC. Once a manufacturer and its devices are in conformance with the Medical Device Directive, the “CE” Mark may be affixed to its devices. The CE Mark gives devices unobstructed entry to all the member countries of the EC.

We have demonstrated conformity to the regulation of EN ISO 13485 and the Medical Device Directive and we affix the CE Mark to our device labeling for product sold in member countries of the EC.
We believe our products and systems are in compliance with all EC requirements. There can be no assurance, however, that other products we are developing or products that we may develop in the future will conform or that additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the EC.
Other Healthcare Laws 
    We are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These laws include:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
•federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; 
•the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;
•federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; 
•the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain health care professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners; and
•analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical and device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to track and report information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or pricing, marketing expenditures and information; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
    Violations of any of the laws described above include civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of an entity’s operations, the debarment, suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs and/or imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
    Our profitability and operations are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes in private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies. Our products are purchased by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers that typically bill various third-party payors, such as 
governmental programs, private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services and products provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for healthcare services and products from third-party payors is critical because it affects which products customer purchase and the prices they are willing to pay since our products are not separately reimbursed by any third-party payor. Third-party payors are increasingly reducing coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare services and products and challenging prices charged for healthcare services and products. 
Health Care Reform
    In the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to limit payments by governmental payors for medical devices, and the procedures in which medical devices are used. For example, in March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was enacted through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act (the “Affordable Care Act”), which, among other things, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the district court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it remains unclear when or how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act or our business.
    In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or internationally, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. Such legislation and regulation of healthcare costs may, however, result in decreased lower reimbursements by governmental and private payors to our customers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Data Privacy and Security
Medical device companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In the U.S., HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to HHS, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that 
merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA applies to certain businesses that collect personal information from California residents, whether directly or indirectly. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for health-related information, including PHI maintained by covered entities and business associates, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. 
Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. In addition, the CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or applicable state laws.
    In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in May 2018 and imposes stringent data protection requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of persons within the EU. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EU as well as to those outside the EU if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Data privacy laws in the EU and the EEA are developing rapidly and, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the Privacy Shield. In addition, the United Kingdom leaving the EU could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. It remains unclear how the United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfer to the United Kingdom from the EU will be regulated, especially following the United Kingdom's departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 without a deal. However, the United Kingdom has transposed the GDPR into domestic law with the Data Protection Act 2018, which remains in force following the United Kingdom's departure from the EU.

Competition
    Our industry is highly competitive. We believe our ability to effectively compete in this industry will be determined by our ability to provide a wide breadth of cost-effective, high quality products. We believe the added breadth of our acquired product portfolios have increased our competitiveness as we can now provide a one-stop shop for customers and offer more flexible competitive pricing. We also believe our acquired infusion pump product offering will enable us to pull through a larger volume of higher margin infusion consumables, and we believe we have a wider customer reach through our unified distribution channels.
 Infusion Consumables
We believe that our ability to effectively compete in the Infusion Consumables market depends upon our ability to differentiate our products based on continued innovation, safety, quality, convenience, reliability, patent protection, ease of use and the pricing of our products, in addition to access to distribution channels. We encounter significant competition in this market both from global, large, established medical device manufacturers and from smaller companies. We compete with products and systems marketed by Becton Dickinson ("BD"), Baxter International ("Baxter"), and B. Braun Medical, Inc. ("B. Braun"). Our CSTD used for the preparation and safe handling of oncology drugs, compete with similar products from BD, and 
B. Braun. We believe that our current CSTD product offering provides benefits over these competing systems in several areas related to safety, ease of use, quality, and cost; however, ongoing innovation in this market space will be required.
Infusion Systems
    We face strong global competitors in the Infusion Systems market. In the United States ("U.S.") our competitors include BD, Baxter, and to a lesser extent B. Braun. Outside of the U.S., our primary competitors are BD, B. Braun, Fresenius Kabi, a division of Fresenius Group and a large number of local market pump manufacturers. These competitors benefit from greater financial, research and development and marketing resources than we have. The smart pump market in recent years has been troubled with security concerns, and product recalls. We believe our ability to effectively compete in this market segment will be determined by our ability to build our brand strength using the development of technological advancements aimed at increasing the quality, reliability and safety of our pumps while at the same time focusing on manufacturing efficiency and cost-effectiveness, which are operationally challenging with evolving product lines.
IV Solutions
    We participate in the IV solutions market only in the U.S. and Canada. Our primary competitors in the U.S. include Baxter, and B. Braun. Demand for IV solutions is typically high and raw materials required to produce IV solutions are readily available. Our ability to compete will depend on our ability to maximize production, develop innovations in our product line, focus on cost-effectiveness and our ability to maintain the appropriate quality infrastructure.
Critical Care
Our primary competitor in Critical Care is Edwards Lifesciences.
Patents

    We have U.S. and/or certain foreign patents relating to the technologies found in the Clave / MicroClave Connector, MicroClave Clear Connector, Neutron Connector, CLC2000 Connector, Tego Connector, ChemoClave Technologies, ChemoLock Technologies, Click Lock Technology, SwabCap, Custom Set Design and Manufacturing Methods, Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System and ClearGuard. We have applications pending for additional U.S. and/or foreign patents on MicroClave Connector, Neutron Connector, Tego Connector, Y-Clave Connector with Integral Check Valve, ChemoClave Technologies, ChemoLock Technologies, Swabcaps, Diana Hazardous Drug Compounding System and ClearGuard.

    With the acquisition of HIS, we acquired rights, title and interest to a substantial number of patents and patent applications and related provisionals, divisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, reissues, reexaminations, extensions, and substitutions of any of the foregoing (“Patent Rights”), that were primarily used or held for use by Pfizer in the HIS business. There is however, no single patent or group of patents that we acquired that we believe is material in relation to our business as a whole.
    Our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. While we have obtained certain patents and applied for additional U.S. and foreign patents covering certain of our products, there is no assurance that any additional patents will be issued, that the scope of any patent protection will prevent competitors from introducing similar devices or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged. Our patents are important in preventing others from introducing competing products that are as effective as our products. The loss of patent protection on the Clave/MicroClave, Neutron, Tego Connector, Swabcap, Clearguard, ChemoClave and ChemoLock technologies, could adversely affect our ability to exclude other manufacturers from producing effective competitive products and could have an adverse impact on our financial results. 
The fact that a patent is issued to us does not eliminate the possibility that patents owned by others may contain claims that are infringed by our products.

There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. Litigation, which would result in substantial cost to us and in diversion of our resources, may be necessary to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Adverse determinations in such litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have initiated litigation, and may continue to initiate litigation in 
the future, to enforce our intellectual property rights against those we believe to be infringing on our patents.  Such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources.

Seasonality/Quarterly Results

There are no significant seasonal aspects to our business. We can experience fluctuations in net sales as a result of variations in the ordering patterns of our largest customers, which may be driven more by production scheduling and their inventory levels, and less by seasonality. Our expenses often do not fluctuate in the same manner as net sales, which may cause fluctuations in operating income that are disproportionate to fluctuations in our revenue.
Research and Development
    Our research and development costs include personnel costs and expenses related to the development of new products. Research and development costs were $42.9 million in 2020, $48.6 million in 2019 and $52.9 million in 2018.
Human Capital Management
We believe our employees are the foundation of our business and are key to executing our strategy globally. The knowledge, skills and abilities of our diverse workforce is paramount in upholding our mission of connecting patients and caregivers through safe, life-saving, life enhancing IV therapy products, systems, and services. 
We believe the health and well-being of our employees are cornerstones for our successful operations. Whether you are a machine operator in one of our four manufacturing locations, a material handler in a distribution center, a service technician supporting our products in the field, or a clinician training the use of our products in a hospital, we strive to prioritize the safety of our team members. This includes designing our work environments with a safety first mindset, providing personal protective equipment, and safety training beginning day one.
Our ability to attract and retain talented individuals globally begins with our commitment to offer a career that gives people a unique opportunity to work in an exhilarating, fast-paced, inspiring, and collaborative environment where what they do makes a difference. We offer competitive salaries and participation to all employees in incentive plans based on individual and company performance. 
We believe the development of our workforce is critical for personal growth and the success of our company as well. We reinforce this with challenging, yet rewarding assignments, continued learning and training programs through our global iLearning platform, and support continued education globally through tuition reimbursement programs. Our team believes in diversity, collaboration, and removing barriers to communication—all to create an environment where innovation and creativity can flourish. This is principal for us in attracting, developing, retaining and rewarding talent on a global scale. 
Finally, our leadership team, with its broad, and deep category knowledge and averaging approximately 17 years of experience in IV therapy has the necessary experience to effectively lead the execution of our strategy. 
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 7,900 employees located in over 20 countries.

COVID-19 Pandemic
In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19") was first reported in Wuhan, China and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally and has led governments and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel restrictions, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread have negatively impacted the economy across many industries. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic may pose significant risks to our business. We operate globally and the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects have impacted most of the locations where we, our customers and our suppliers conduct business. We expect COVID-19 will continue to have an impact on our financial 
condition and results of operations in the near term and may have a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations in future periods. See “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Also, see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
