Item 1.
Business.

Overview

On May 30, 2006, Basanite, Inc. was organized as a Nevada corporation. Basanite and its wholly owned subsidiaries are herein referred to as the "Company", we, our, or us. Currently based in Pompano Beach, Florida, the Company manufactures concrete-reinforcing products made from basalt fiber reinforced polymers (BFRP), such as its primary product BasaFlexTM. This UV-stable, chemical, acid and moisture resistant material is sustainable and environmentally friendly and has been engineered to replace steel as it never rusts, therefore, addressing the industrys current corrosion issues. See Managements Discussion and Analysis section for more details.
Competition

The market for the manufacture and sale of construction related products is one of the largest markets in the world. Our Basanite products for reinforcement of concrete compete as replacements for traditional steel and other fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) industry established products. The steel industry is very mature and entrenched with our potential customers and the specifying community. Accordingly, our business competes with large, established steel companies that have large and established wholesale and retail distribution networks. Most of our competitors are large and have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than our Company. We also compete with other manufacturers of products often marketed as alternatives to steel, including manufacturers of fiberglass, and other types of fiber products. Many of these players also have substantially greater resources than our Company.

While we believe that our products are unique and create a new segment within the concrete reinforcement industry, we still expect to compete with these large companies, both inside and outside of the United States, as they aggressively market their existing products, as well as any new products they may be developing that are competitive to ours.

Governmental Regulation

Basalt fiber reinforced polymer rebar is subject to various testing and certifications from various private and public entities, such as the Department of Transportation and the US Army Corps of Engineers, in order to satisfy regulatory requirements for use as concrete reinforcement. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure such approvals and certifications in the future. Furthermore, we are dependent on third party independent groups, such as universities or other certifying bodies, to obtain approvals and certifications. Inability to secure approvals and certifications could materially harm our ability to generate revenue.
Human Capital

Our employees are essential to our purposeto create an innovative, sustainable, productive, and extended future; our valuesteamwork and innovation; and our strategy and execution. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of various backgrounds and experiences. In attracting a diverse workforce, we stress the teamwork approach as well as the life work balance philosophy. Our workforce is highly technical, with the substantial majority of our employees working in engineering, technical and financial roles. During the year 2020, we increased our workforce by 155%. At December 31, 2020, we had twenty-three full time employees, all of which are employed for the continuing operations of the Company. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, nor governed by any collective bargaining agreements. We consider relations with our labor force as satisfactory. At December 31, 2019, we had ten full time employees.
