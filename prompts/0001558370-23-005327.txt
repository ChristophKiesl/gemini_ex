Item 1.Business
Overview
Molekule Group, Inc. (the “Company,” “Molekule,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a pathogen elimination technology company on a mission to keep work, play and life going by improving indoor air quality. We have the largest range of proprietary and patented, FDA-cleared air purification devices to address the rapidly growing global air purification market. Our air hygiene product, Pūrgo™ (pure-go), is an FDA 510(k) cleared, Class II medical device that provides continuous air filtration, sanitization and supplemental ventilation solutions with technology that can be applied in any indoor space – including in hospitals, offices and even in elevators. Pūrgo™ products feature SteriDuct™, a proprietary germicidal UV-C technology. In addition, our Air Pro and Air Mini+ air purifiers leverage a PECO technology that can destroy viruses, bacteria, mold, allergens, volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), chemicals and more from the air. Our purpose is simple: to never stop innovating solutions that keep people healthy and safe, so life never stops.
In June 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) granted our Pūrgo technology 510(k) clearance for use in healthcare and other markets for which product performance to reduce the amount of certain airborne particles and infectious microbes in an indoor environment must be validated to specific standards.
On January 12, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Molekule, Inc., which produces and sells air purification devices that can be used by both consumer and commercial users. These air purifiers incorporate our patented technology, photoelectrochemical oxidation (“PECO”), to capture and destroy a wide range of organic material, such as bacteria, viruses, mold and volatile organic compounds.
On February 26, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Aura Smart Air Ltd. (“Aura”), an Israeli company listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and the creator of a proprietary, software, sensor and internet-of-things (“IoT”) enabled data-driven air purification system. We intend to implement Aura’s advanced software, sensor and IoT technology across our entire product range and in each of our highly developed sales channels, including major global healthcare, commercial and municipal customers, seeking multi-location and multi-room, enterprise-wide safe air solutions. Consummation of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including among others the SEC declaring our registration statement on Form S-4 effective, the listing of our common stock on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, receipt of Aura shareholder approval, receipt of a tax ruling regarding Israeli withholding tax and receipt of all material third party consents. The merger is expected to close early in the second half of 2023.
As part of our business strategy, we continually evaluate a wide array of strategic opportunities, including the acquisition, disposition or licensing of intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions. We may seek to acquire technologies, product lines and companies that operate in businesses similar to our own or that are ancillary, complementary or adjacent to our own or in which we do not currently operate. Such businesses could operate in the air purification space or more generally in the health and wellness space or in other industries. We could also seek to merge with or into another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another company. We could also seek to merge with or into another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another company. In connection with these activities, we may enter into non-binding letters of intent as we assess the commercial appeal of potential strategic transactions. Any transactions that we enter into could be material to our business, financial condition and operating results.
We were formed as Cleanco Bioscience Group LLC, a limited liability company in Florida, in September 2011 and effected a name change to AeroClean Technologies, LLC and conversion to a Delaware limited liability company in September 2020. On November 23, 2021, we converted into a Delaware corporation as AeroClean Technologies, Inc. On January 12, 2023, we effected a name change to Molekule Group, Inc. in connection with our acquisition of Molekule, Inc.

Pūrgo
Our air hygiene product, Pūrgo™, is an FDA 510(k) cleared, Class II medical device that provides continuous air filtration, sanitization and supplemental ventilation solutions with technology that can be applied in any indoor space – including in hospitals, offices and even in elevators. Pūrgo™ products feature SteriDuct™, a proprietary germicidal UV-C LED technology. Our proprietary, patented UV-C LED technology is incorporated in our equipment and devices to reduce the exposure of occupants of interior spaces to airborne particles and pathogens. These spaces include hospital and non-hospital healthcare facilities (such as outpatient chemotherapy and other infusion facilities and senior living centers and nursing homes), schools and universities, commercial properties and other indoor spaces. Pūrgo has been well-received by our customers.
Air Mini+
The Air Mini+ is a direct-to-consumer air purifier whose features include a particle sensor, five fan speeds and automatic fan speed adjustment through the product’s Auto Protect Mode. The Air Mini+ is designed for customers seeking air purifiers for smaller rooms and is most effective for rooms 250 square feet in size, or smaller. It stands 12 inches high, 8.26 inches in diameter, and weighs just over seven pounds. The purifier is designed to be whisper quiet, producing 39 decibels at its lowest fan speed and 62 decibels at its highest.
The Air Mini+ particle sensor detects the amount of particulate matter in the air of the room in which the air purifier operates. If on Auto Protect Mode, Air Mini+ will automatically adjust the air purifier’s fan speed based on particulate matter sensed in the air. With these features, Air Mini+ responds in real-time to reduce the amount of particles in the air like pollen and dust, while also capturing and destroying other indoor air pollutants including VOCs, mold, bacteria and viruses. The product is also Wi-Fi and app enabled, allowing users to control it on iOS and Android devices, and has Apple Homekit integration.
Air Pro
We offer the Air Pro as a direct-to-consumer and business-to-business product for larger rooms of up to 1,000 square feet with similar features to the Air Mini+. The Air Pro is also equipped with PECO technology and includes sensors that measure VOCs, carbon dioxide and relative humidity in the air, six fan speeds and Auto Protect Mode. It is 23.1 inches high, 10.9 inches wide, weighs 22.9 pounds and produces 33 to 64 decibels of sound.
Air Pro Rx
The Air Pro Rx is a medical-grade purifier designed for critical or high traffic areas in healthcare facilities for rooms in excess of 600 square feet. The Air Pro Rx is equipped with PECO technology and includes two filters and four different settings to manage air flow. It is 12 inches high, 8.26 inches wide, weighs 7.3 pounds and produces 39 to 69 decibels of sound.
Filters and Filter Replacements
We offer replacement filters for the Air Mini+, Air Pro and Air Pro Rx on a subscription basis or as-needed for single purchases. We recommend to customers that they replace the filter in their air purifier every six months to support maximum efficiency.
PECO-HEPA Tri-Power
Our new PECO-HEPA Tri-Power filter, launched in October 2022, offers the potential for one of the highest levels of purification available in the market. Combining PECO and HEPA technologies, as well as a carbon filter, into one product creates a robust filter to capture and destroy particles, chemicals and viruses. The filter’s improved efficiency offers our customers three layers of protection: our PECO technology that destroys toxic gases, viruses, bacteria, mold, allergens, organic compounds, and more; HEPA technology, the industry standard in particle capture and filtration; and carbon filtration with odor and gas-reducing purification power.
Molekule App & 28 Day View
The Molekule mobile application (the “Molekule App”), launched in summer 2022, is available in both Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store and gives our customers the opportunity to activate their subscriptions, adjust the settings on their Molekule air

purifiers and, in the case of Air Pro customers, the ability to monitor changes in IAQ over time. The Molekule App provides a 28 day look back of IAQ trends sensed by the Air Pro air purifier, breaking down pollutants detected, including VOCs, and pollutants that range from PM 1 to PM 10 in size. The Molekule App lists the top three pollutants detected by a customer’s air purifier and provides an Air Score ranging from good, moderate, bad, and very bad.
Molekule Air Platform
Molekule Air Platform (the “MAP”), launched in September 2022, is a dashboard that allows data from multiple air purifiers and controls to be accessed in one interface, and is ideal for healthcare, education, business, hospitality and government settings.
The MAP is designed to provide a unique set of features for businesses, including:

● | Fleet onboarding for quick activation: Fleet onboarding allows organizations to onboard multiple air purifiers at the same time through the business-to-business app. Once an air purifier is onboarded to the MAP, that purifier will allow other purifiers to securely onboard.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unique dashboards to increase visibility: Unique dashboards enable users to see the IAQ of every room where a Molekule air purifier is located, as well as an air purifier’s status, which allows users to see which rooms have the highest IAQ, and which rooms need more time to have the air cleaned.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Markets
Our mission is to establish Molekule as the leader in creating a safe indoor environment, free of dangerous pathogens, particles, allergens, mold and fungi, for the healthcare, commercial office, educational and transportation marketplaces. Our goal is to become the leading provider of airborne pathogen-eradication solutions, through the application of air sanitization using our UV-C LED and UV light and filtration media technologies, and to create comprehensive solutions for at-risk enclosed spaces across hospitals, outpatient treatment facilities, universities and schools, senior living and nursing homes, non-hospital healthcare facilities, commercial buildings and the human transport and travel industries.
The global air purification market is estimated to be valued at $15 billion and is projected to grow to approximately $25 billion by 2030. The Environmental Protection Agency has found that indoor air may be up to five times as polluted as outdoor air. In addition, there are approximately 26 million asthma sufferers and 40 million allergy sufferers in the United States and 300 million asthma sufferers and 800 million allergy sufferers around the world, presenting a significant market opportunity for the air purifier market. Moreover, increased government regulations related to air quality control, combined with rising levels of pollution, airborne diseases and natural catastrophes, have also contributed to an increase in consumer demand for air purifiers. For example, there have been over 600 million COVID-19 cases globally and wildfires are forecasted to rise by 50% by the year 2100. It is currently estimated that an air purification device is in one in every four American homes.
Since the design architecture of the pathogen killing SteriDuct has an efficient high air flow and a low pressure loss profile, the design is flexible and can be incorporated into many applications. Implementation of our SteriDuct technology into the Pūrgo devices incorporates both a sophisticated filtration system that reduces particles, odors, organic solvents, bacteria, viruses, allergen and mold, as well as our patented UV-C LED based pathogen killing system. SteriDuct may also be used in large spaces such as lecture halls and auditoriums. SteriDuct purification devices can be deployed at the HVAC discharge grille or at the central air handler. This implementation would not require additional fans in the air handler due to the low-pressure characteristics of SteriDuct. We expect that similar configurations can be developed for airplanes and buses.
We sell our products through three primary channels:

● | Retail channel. We offer Molekule products in more than 10 countries and throughout some of the largest retailers in the United States.

Historically, a majority of Molekule, Inc.’s revenue has been driven through its direct-to-consumer channel. We will continue to expand this channel through creative advertising and marketing programs, including digital advertising (Meta Platforms, Google platforms, podcasts and digital video), direct mail and other programing. Additionally, Molekule has a strong strategic partner in Amazon whom we expect will continue to drive revenue. With our proprietary Molekule Air Platform software, we are seeing increased interest from our business partners. We will be specifically targeting organizations in the hospitality sector, the medical and healthcare sector, the transportation sector, and the education and government sectors. We are dedicated to science and technology in order to deliver the best possible IAQ to our customers by leveraging our sensors and software to make visible and destroy otherwise invisible pollutants.
Engineering and Manufacturing of Products; Sourcing of Components
We outsource the manufacturing of our products to several contract manufacturers, including: Mack Molding Company, Inc. (“Mack Molding”), a leading contract manufacturer of medical devices, which also has experience manufacturing devices for the transportation, energy/environment, defense/aerospace and consumer markets; Inventec Appliances Corporation (“IAC”), the primary entity that manufactures and assembles our air purifiers; and Columbus Industries, Inc. (“Columbus Industries”), the manufacturer of the filters for our air purifiers. Our in-house facility provides the chemical coating for the filters manufactured by Columbus Industries. IAC manufactures our products in their facilities located in Malaysia and China, while Columbus Industries manufactures our filters in Mexico. We provide the chemical coating process for our filters in our Lakeland, Florida facility. The components used in our products are sourced either directly by us or on our behalf by our contract manufacturers from a variety of component suppliers selected by us and located worldwide. Our operations employees coordinate our relationships with our contract manufacturers and component suppliers. We believe that using outsourced manufacturing enables greater scale and flexibility at lower costs than establishing our own manufacturing facilities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our current contract manufacturers and component suppliers, including, whether or not to utilize new or alternative contract manufacturers or component suppliers or to conduct manufacturing capabilities in-house.
We also contracted with Intelligent Product Solutions Inc. (“IPS”), a leading medical and technology device engineering group, in developing the device configuration, which would optimize the performance and reliability of our patented technologies. With over 100 designers and engineers who specialize in commercializing highly exacting applications of new technology, a dedicated IPS team has worked continuously with us to design, develop, test and source the components for the commercial production of the Pūrgo device. This is particularly true of electronics design and software engineering as well as product industrial design. We also engaged MethodSense, a regulatory affairs and quality assurance consulting firm, to reduce time to market and move our devices successfully through the FDA regulatory process. MethodSense is a global medical device consultancy and software developer with over 21 years of deep industry experience, proven processes and modern technology focused on the commercial success of medical device companies.

We work with third-party fulfillment partners that deliver our products from multiple locations worldwide, which allows us to reduce order fulfillment time, reduce shipping costs, and improve inventory flexibility. We manage our inventory based on sales and production forecasts and anticipated lead times for sourcing components and assembly.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As the leader in the fast-growing market for air purification devices, we have developed a significant patent portfolio to protect certain elements of our proprietary technology.
Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. As of March 22, 2023, we had seven issued U.S. utility patents, and 14 utility patent applications, including four provisional patent applications, pending in the United States. Our currently issued utility patents will expire at different times in the future, with the earliest expiring in 2031 and the latest expiring in 2041. Our currently pending applications will generally remain in effect for 20 years from the date of filing of the initial applications. As of March 22, 2023, we had three issued U.S. design patents, and three design patent applications pending in the United States. As of March 22, 2023, we had 16 design patents issued in six foreign countries and one design patent application pending in one foreign country (India). We maintain all utility and design patents and file for renewal at specified times to the extent such patents are and remain relevant to our business. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States, and in pursuing such registrations, we have conducted trademark clearance searches where appropriate. As of March 22, 2023, we had an international trademark portfolio comprised of 39 registered trademarks.

This fundamental technology for the Air Mini+, Air Pro and Air Pro Rx has been licensed from the University of Florida, and a modification of the technology has been licensed from the University of South Florida, which is not yet integrated in the air purifiers. Since 2014, Molekule, Inc. has developed its own intellectual property, which is protected in the form of patents or patent applications and trade secrets. The novel air photoelectrochemical purification systems and methodology, filter configuration and shape and filter manufacturing related inventions have been protected through patents, while PECO chemistry and coating process have been kept as trade secrets. The aesthetic designs of Molekule, Inc.’s commercialized air purifiers have been protected through design patents.
The University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc. has granted Molekule, Inc. an exclusive worldwide license for use of PECO technology in certain licensed products and processes the consideration for which includes minimum annual royalty payments paid quarterly and a royalty of 1.5% of net sales received from licensed products subject to potential reductions in connection with certain financing efforts and to the minimum royalty payments.
The University of South Florida Research Foundation, Inc. (“USFRF”) has granted Molekule, Inc. an exclusive worldwide license to certain modifications of the PECO technology, which are not currently in use in our air purifier products. Molekule, Inc. paid a license issue fee of $30,000 and a $1,000 minimum royalty payment to USFRF for 2022. Additional royalties would be due with respect to any sales of licensed products and processes making use of the technology.
We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we file in the future, nor can we be sure that any existing patents or any patents that may be granted in the future upon which we rely will be commercially useful in protecting our products or processes.
Competition
We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors implicated by climate change has increased, and will continue to increase, the global focus on clean air. We experience competition from organizations such as large, diverse companies with extensive product development and manufacturing, as well as smaller specialized companies, that have developed and are attempting to develop air filtration and purification systems. We believe that we have significant competitive advantages over other organizations. For example, we believe that products that compete with our products in the “medical grade” niche are expensive, cumbersome and have a limited effective life.

10



Additionally, we believe many of our competitors are promoting technologies that are not proven, do not have enough scientific data and are potentially harmful. Importantly, our SteriDuct and PECO technologies meet or exceed each of the air purifiers guidelines and recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Environmental Protection Agency and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers.
Our competitors may develop and commercialize products and technologies that compete with our products and technologies. Organizations that compete with us may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to: (i) provide broader services and product lines; (ii) make greater investments in research and development; (iii) carry on larger research and development initiatives; (iv) undertake more extensive marketing campaigns; and (v) adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. They also may have greater name recognition and better access to customers than we do. We also expect to continue to face competition from alternative technologies. As we introduce new products, as the air purification market or our business evolves, or as other companies introduce new products, services or technologies, we may become subject to additional competition in the United States and in other countries. Our technology and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by advances in existing technological approaches or products or the development of different approaches or products by one or more of our competitors.
Regulation
We are subject to regulation by the FDA in marketing our devices, having received 510(k) clearance for Pūrgo, Air Pro, Air Pro Rx and Air Mini+ in June 2022, April 2020, September 2021 and March 2021, respectively, classifying each as a Class II medical device. FDA 510(k) clearance enables the marketing and use of our products as medical devices in healthcare and other markets for which product performance is required to be validated by certified independent labs.
The FDA regulates the development, design, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, clearance, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
After an air purification product is cleared for marketing as a medical device, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

● | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements that manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with applicable regulations covering the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distributions, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. Regulations also require, among other things, maintenance of a device master record, device history file and complaint files. As a specification developer of regulated medical devices, our facilities and records relating to such devices are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. In addition, as a manufacturer, each of Mack Moldings’, IAC’s and Columbus Industries’ facilities, records and manufacturing processes are also subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations, which list instances where the FDA investigator believes the inspected entity has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the entity fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue a Warning Letter, which are notices of intended enforcement actions. For less serious violations that may not rise to the level of regulatory significance, the FDA may issue an Untitled Letter. The FDA may take more significant administrative or legal action, such as the shutdown of or placing restrictions on the entity’s operations or the recall or seizure of related products, if the entity continues to be in substantial noncompliance with applicable regulations. The discovery of previously unknown problems with our devices could result in restrictions on the device, including the inability to market the device for its intended use or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:

● | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recalls, withdrawals or administrative detention or seizure of our devices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

Environmental Matters
We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those governing the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into ground, air or water, noise emissions, the generation, storage, use, management and disposal of hazardous and other waste, the import, export and registration of chemicals, the cleanup of contaminated sites, and the health and safety of our employees. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect environmental costs and contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our operations. The operation of our Lakeland, Florida facility, however, entails risks in these areas. Significant expenditures could be required in the future to comply with environmental or health and safety laws, regulations or other requirements. Certain of these compliance requirements are imposed by our customers, who at times require us to be registered with U.S. health or safety regulatory agencies, whether on the federal or state level.
Under environmental laws and regulations, we are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations.
In the European marketplace, among others, electrical and electronic equipment is required to comply with the Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment of the EU, which aims to prevent waste by encouraging reuse and recycling, and the EU Directive on Restriction of Use of Certain Hazardous Substances, which restricts the use of various hazardous substances in electrical and 

12



electronic products. Our products and certain components of such products “put on the market” in the EU (whether or not manufactured in the EU) are subject to these directives. Additionally, we are required to comply with certain laws, regulations and directives governing chemicals, including the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act and Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”), the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (“RoHS”) and Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (“CLP”) in the EU. These and similar laws and regulations require, among others, the registration, evaluation, authorization and labeling of certain chemicals that we use and ship.
Employees
As of March 22, 2022, we had 92 employees, 91 of which were full-time employees. We also utilize full-time independent contractors and full-time equivalent consultants as well as consulting firms for product development, engineering, quality and regulatory matters, investor relations, marketing and advertising, public relations and social media. We also utilize many consultants in the ordinary course of our business and hire additional personnel on a project-by-project basis.
