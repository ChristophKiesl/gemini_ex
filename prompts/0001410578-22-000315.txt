Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of effecting an Initial Business Combination.
We are a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) driven by a unique and purpose-driven mission: to partner with a company making a positive difference in the world and support its growth to create value for all stakeholders. To share in that value creation, each of our Sponsors intends to donate all of their respective Founders Shares and warrants to initiatives supporting the economic empowerment and inclusion of underrepresented groups. It is our and our Sponsors’ core belief that by both empowering businesses focused on making a positive difference in the world and our Sponsors using their profits and at-risk capital to reinvest in our communities, we and our Sponsors can deliver significant stockholder value while also promoting a more inclusive economy and society.
We are not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating our Initial Business Combination. Rather, we seek to identify a business with a strong, dedicated management team that will benefit from access to public capital markets to support its growth. In particular, we see the opportunity to create significant value by partnering with a well-managed company that can leverage the strategic resources of our Management Team, Board and Sponsors during and after the Initial Business Combination. We are seeking a partner that is focused on delivering products, solutions or services that move society forward, whether that means empowering people, advancing diversity and inclusion, broadening accessibility, increasing societal well-being, or enhancing sustainability. While we are industry agnostic, we are firm in our belief that profit and mission can be mutually re-enforcing to help create a better, more inclusive world.
Our focus on businesses making a positive difference in the world is also meant to address what has been a historical lack of access to private and public growth capital for these firms. As a result of this challenge, there are few publicly traded businesses or firms directly focused on empowerment, inclusion, accessibility, or sustainability, and therefore limited options for investors to express what we believe is a growing interest to invest in companies focused on improving the world. We plan to deploy our capital and resources in a manner that is counter to these historical imbalances and to support a funding ecosystem for diverse and inclusive firms more broadly.
We have assembled a highly diverse, experienced, and connected Management Team and Board that, along with our Sponsors, will help drive our purpose-driven mission. Collectively, our organization brings considerable expertise and resources in target sourcing, transaction structuring, financial, operational, and strategic due diligence and ongoing business support across a broad set of disciplines.

We and our Sponsors expect to leverage the resources of each of PNC and Jefferies to pursue opportunities that may be available across a variety of industries and create value in an eventual business combination. Specifically, we will use the sourcing, structuring, and execution capabilities of PNC’s Corporate & Institutional Banking group, including Solebury Capital, PNC’s capital markets advisory affiliate, Harris Williams & Co. (“Harris Williams”), its affiliated M&A advisory firm, and PNC’s Asset Management Group, as well as Jefferies’ global investment banking and merchant banking businesses to identify, conduct due diligence, structure, underwrite, and execute an Initial Business Combination. We believe access to these unique channels and our Management Team’s deep expertise, as well as the broader corporate capabilities of PNC and Jefferies, will provide us with a definitive advantage in identifying and executing a value-accretive Initial Business Combination.
Business Strategy
Our objective is to draw upon the significant experience and resources of our Sponsors and Management Team to partner with a business focused on making a positive difference in the world and provide strategic advice in support of its ongoing growth and success to create enduring value for all stakeholders. In furtherance of our efforts, our Sponsors plan to donate the capital and returns from their investment in the business to support the economic empowerment and economic inclusion of underrepresented groups.
In executing our strategy, we are leveraging the broad and varied sourcing platforms of our Sponsors and their respective affiliates to identify a high-quality business partner, use our significant transaction expertise to undertake due diligence, and structure an acquisition on attractive terms. After identifying a target, we plan to utilize these considerable resources to provide strategic advice in support of the target business’s ongoing growth and success.
As we undertake this purpose-driven mission, we believe that we will benefit from:

Purpose-Driven Re-investment by Sponsors of Risk Capital and Profits
Both PNC and Jefferies have long histories of supporting diversity and inclusion as well as economic empowerment efforts.
PNC
Our sponsor, PNCIC, is an affiliate of PNC. PNC has long embraced diversity and inclusion not just as the right thing to do, but as a business imperative. To effectively compete in the market, the company recognizes that it must reflect the diversity of its customers and suppliers, as well as the communities in which it operates.
This commitment comes to life in a variety of ways, including the diversity of PNC’s Board of Directors, which today includes more people of color than at any other point in the company’s history; and in the engagement of its employees, a record number of whom are members of PNC’s Employee Business Resource Groups that provide support to colleagues with a shared heritage, gender, sexual orientation, background, or intergenerational connection. PNC continues to work to strengthen this commitment, engaging employees across the organization in an active dialogue on how PNC can continue to build an even more diverse and inclusive culture. This work is led by PNC executive leadership, including its Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer, with active input and engagement by the PNC Board of Directors.
PNC also firmly believes that its prosperity will be proportional to the prosperity the company creates for its employees and customers in the communities where PNC operates.
PNC Bank, National Association, the national bank subsidiary of PNC (“PNC Bank”), has earned an “Outstanding” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act since inception more than 40 years ago, and has been nationally recognized for the impact of PNC Grow Up Great, a bilingual, multi-year initiative launched in 2004 that helps prepare children from birth to age 5 for success in school and life, with a particular emphasis on helping children, families, and others in diverse and low- and moderate-income communities.

13



Building on these efforts, in 2020 PNC announced a commitment of more than $1 billion to help end systemic racism and support economic empowerment of Black Americans and low- and moderate-income communities. This commitment includes more than $1 billion in community development financing and capital for neighborhood revitalization, consumer, and small businesses; enhancements to PNC’s existing employee matching gift program to include support for qualifying non-profit organizations that support economic empowerment and social justice educational efforts; and a commitment to fully engage PNC employees in support of qualifying social justice and economic empowerment non-profits by providing up to 40 hours of paid time off for volunteerism dedicated to these causes. It also includes more than $50 million in charitable support for national and local work focused on helping end systemic racism and promoting social justice; expanding financial education and workforce development initiatives; and enhancing low-income neighborhood revitalization and affordable housing.
PNC plans to donate the capital and investment returns from its sponsor interest (via PNCIC) in our company to the PNC Foundation to support efforts to drive economic empowerment for Black Americans and low- and moderate-income communities. The PNC Foundation is the primary vehicle for PNC’s charitable activities and seeks to form partnerships with community-based nonprofit organizations to support PNC’s philanthropic efforts. Over the last 10 years, the PNC Foundation has provided nearly $500 million of grants in the communities that PNC serves.
Jefferies
Jefferies is committed to having an active role in promoting diversity and inclusion both internally, striving for a firm that reflects society as a whole, and externally, creating lasting change in the communities where Jefferies operates. Most recently, more than 1,500 employees have come together to reflect upon and discuss how racism, bias, and stereotypes limit both the economic and professional opportunities of diverse communities. Addressing these issues in the near- and long-term is of utmost importance to Jefferies through firm-wide engagement, senior leadership engagement, and client and community engagement.
Jefferies’ commitment to diversity and inclusion is reinforced across the organization. Jefferies’ Global Diversity Council is chaired by Chief Executive Officer, Rich Handler, and in 2019 a full-time employee, reporting to the Head of Human Capital, was appointed to spearhead and implement diversity and inclusion policies and practices globally. In addition, several internal Employee Resource Groups have been established to foster an inclusive, diverse working environment with a focus on equitable treatment for diverse communities and providing resources and networking opportunities to promote career development and advancement. Jefferies is also focused on external diversity and inclusion efforts through various student organizations that seek to improve academic and career opportunities through paid internships, mentoring, and training.
Investment Criteria
Consistent with our strategy and purpose-driven mission, we have identified the following criteria and focus areas to guide our evaluation of acquisition opportunities across industries.

◾ | Moving Society Forward – Empowerment, Inclusion, Accessibility, and Sustainability: We are looking for a business partner that is helping improve the world, whether that means empowering people, creating a more inclusive society, helping make products or solutions more accessible, contributing to the health and well-being of society, or improving sustainability. We seek a partner that shares our vision and belief in the value of diversity and inclusion, and believe that there is an opportunity to move society forward while creating enduring value for all stakeholders. We see these opportunities happening across multiple parts of society and the economy, and as a result we are not limiting our search to any particular industry.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Strong Management Team: We seek to partner with a business with a strong existing management team that is aligned with our purpose-driven mission and focused on long-term value creation. Where appropriate, we will work with management to help advance diversity and inclusion initiatives at the company as we believe a diverse and inclusive management team and board are critical to driving long-term success.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Defensible Market Position: We seek to partner with a business with a strong position in their target market as a result of a differentiated technology, proprietary intellectual property, strong brand recognition and customer reputation, privileged distribution capabilities, or other competitive advantages.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14




◾ | Attractive Growth Prospects: We seek to partner with a business that has the potential to grow organically as well as through acquisitions, including those enabled by the public stock currency created in the Initial Business Combination. We will look for companies operating in industries with appealing long-term growth characteristics where incremental investment – either organic or from acquisitions – can be levered against favorable secular tailwinds.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Ability to Generate Strong Cash Flows: We generally seek to partner with a business that has shown a history of generating strong and sustainable cash flows, but are open to acquiring a business that, at the time of the Initial Business Combination, is cash-flow negative so long as it has the potential to generate strong positive cash flows in the near future.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Benefit from Our Resources: We seek to partner with a business that will benefit from access to the public capital markets as well as from the strategic advice that our Management Team and Sponsors can provide.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Sourced Through Proprietary Channels: We seek to partner with a business by leveraging our broad and diverse sourcing platform and do not expect to rely on a broadly marketed process to find a target.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, and criteria that our Management Team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our Initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our Initial Business Combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Initial Business Combination
The rules of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) measured at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Our Board will make the determination as to the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination. If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our Board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s business, assets, or prospects. In addition, pursuant to NYSE rules, any Initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.

15



We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our Public Stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination in such a way that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an Initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and to us in the Initial Business Combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% of net assets test. If the Initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as our Initial Business Combination for purposes of seeking stockholder approval or conducting a tender offer, as applicable, even if such acquisitions are not closed simultaneously.
The net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants released to us from the Trust Account upon the closing of our Initial Business Combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of the target business with which we complete our Initial Business Combination. If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital.
We are targeting businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants. As a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemption by Public Stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete our Initial Business Combination.
In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our Initial Business Combination to be used following the closing for general corporate purposes as described above.
There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances, or other indebtedness in connection with our Initial Business Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our Sponsors, officers, directors, or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our Initial Business Combination.
We may also obtain financing prior to the closing of our Initial Business Combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection with our search for and completion of our Initial Business Combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to receive funds from the Trust Account or vote on any Initial Business Combination or on matters related to our pre-Initial Business Combination activity.

Our Business Combination Process
In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors and, as applicable, on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews, and other reviews as we deem appropriate. Although we intend to focus on identifying companies that are making a positive difference in the world, we will consider an Initial Business Combination outside of these areas if an Initial Business Combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive business combination opportunity for our Company or we are unable to identify a suitable candidate in these areas after having expended a reasonable amount of time and effort in an attempt to do so.
Members of our Management Team own our Common Stock and warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our Initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination.
Our Sponsors and members of our Management Team are, in the ordinary course of business, made aware of potential acquisition or investment opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for an Initial Business Combination.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors become aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
U.S. Bank Holding Company Act and Related Matters
Background
PNC is regulated as a bank holding company (“BHC”) under the Bank Holding Company Act (the “BHCA”), which generally restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. PNC has elected to become a financial holding company (“FHC”) under the BHCA and, as such, may engage in a broader range of financial and related activities (e.g., securities underwriting, asset management, insurance, and merchant banking). The ability to elect and maintain FHC status is subject to certain conditions.
Business Combination Targets’ Activities
Upon consummation of a transaction with a business combination target, it is contemplated that PNC will hold its indirect investment in the post-transaction company pursuant to the merchant banking authority of the BHCA or Section 4(k) of the BHCA, depending on the business activities of the post-transaction company.

17



If the post-transaction company is not exclusively engaged in financial activities that are permissible for FHCs, PNC likely will hold its indirect investment in the post-transaction company pursuant to the merchant banking authority of the BHCA. The merchant banking authority of the BHCA imposes a maximum 10-year holding period on PNC’s investment in the post-transaction company. In addition, the merchant banking authority of the BHCA will restrict employees of PNC and its affiliates (including employees of PNCIC) from participating in the routine management and operations of the post-transaction company, and will limit the ability of PNC Bank to engage in cross-marketing activities with the post-transaction company.
If the post-transaction company is exclusively engaged in financial activities that are permissible for FHCs, PNC likely will hold its indirect investment in the post-transaction company as a non-controlling investment under Section 4(k) of the BHCA. In order to be a non-controlling investment, PNC could not own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 24.9% of any class of voting securities of the post-transaction company or more than 33.3% of the total equity of the post-transaction company. In addition, relationships (e.g., director or officer representatives, business relationships, etc.) between PNC and the post-transaction company would be subject to certain limitations.
If the Federal Reserve were to deem the post-transaction company to be controlled by PNC for purposes of the BHCA, the post-transaction company would be considered a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHCA and subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve, including the activity limitations applicable to subsidiaries of a BHC under the BHCA and its implementing regulations.
Covered Transactions
For various reasons, we may be considered an “affiliate” of PNC Bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. As a result, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act would limit the amount of any covered transactions (e.g., extensions of credit) between PNC Bank, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand, and would require all covered transactions between PNC Bank and us to be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Furthermore, any extensions of credit from PNC Bank to us would have to be secured by a statutorily defined amount of collateral. Finally, Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act would require that certain transactions, including all covered transactions, between PNC Bank and our Company be on arm’s length market terms and conditions.
The Volcker Rule
The Volcker Rule added a new Section 13 to the BHCA that restricts banking entities, such as PNC, absent an applicable exclusion or exemption, from acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership, or other ownership interests in, or sponsoring, a covered fund. We do not believe that our anticipated activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act and, therefore, it is not expected that we will rely on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act to be exempt from registration as an investment company. Accordingly, we do not expect that we will be treated as a covered fund under the Volcker Rule. Further, upon consummation of a transaction with a business combination target, it is contemplated that PNC will hold its investment in the post-transaction company pursuant to the merchant banking authority of the BHCA or as a non-controlling investment under Section 4(k) of the BHCA. Therefore, we do not expect that the post-transaction company will be a “banking entity” as defined in the Volcker Rule. Accordingly, we do not expect that the post-transaction company will be subject to the restrictions of the Volcker Rule.
Our Management Team
Members of our Management Team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any member of our Management Team will devote in any period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the current stage of the business combination process.

18



We believe our Management Team’s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our Management Team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships with businesses that are focused on improving the world, whether through empowerment, inclusion, accessibility, or sustainability. This network has grown through the activities of our Management Team sourcing, acquiring, and financing businesses; our Management Team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources, and target management teams; and the experience of our Management Team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. See “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for a more complete description of our Management Team’s experience.
Status as a Public Company
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following an Initial Business Combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.
We believe target businesses will find the business combination method a potentially more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than a traditional initial public offering. The traditional initial public offering process typically takes a longer time than the average business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses and market and other uncertainties in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an Initial Business Combination with us.
Furthermore, once a proposed Initial Business Combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an Initial Business Combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions.
While we believe that our structure and our Management Team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed Initial Business Combination, negatively.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to 

19



be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our Common Stock held by nonaffiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our Class A common stock held by nonaffiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
Financial Position
With funds available for an Initial Business Combination initially in the amount of $266,340,000, after payment of $9,660,000 of deferred underwriting fees, before fees and expenses associated with our Initial Business Combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our Initial Business Combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and we cannot provide any assurance that it will be available to us.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

20



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our Initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds from our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by Public Stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete our Initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. In the case of an Initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the Initial Business Combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our Initial Business Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our Sponsors, officers, directors, or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our Initial Business Combination.
Sources of Potential Target Businesses
Our officers and directors, as well as our Sponsors and their respective affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows, conferences, or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our Sponsors and their respective industry and business contacts as well as their affiliates. We also anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and know what types of businesses we are targeting. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s-length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our Management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our Management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case, any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting, or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our Sponsors, officers, directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of an Initial Business Combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our Initial Business Combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an Initial Business Combination candidate.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with an Initial Business Combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsors, officers, or directors or making the Initial Business Combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsors, officers, or directors. In the event we seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with an Initial Business Combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsors, officers, or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an Initial Business Combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view.
As more fully discussed in “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an Initial Business Combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.

21



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
NYSE rules and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) measured at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. The fair market value of our Initial Business Combination will be determined by our Board based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our Board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our Initial Business Combination. Subject to this requirement and any regulatory limitations related to PNC’s status as a BHC, our Management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our Initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
In any case, we will only complete an Initial Business Combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for our stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may complete our Initial Business Combination.
To the extent we effect our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our Management Team will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot provide any assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
In evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent ownership, management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period after the completion of our Initial Business Combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an Initial Business Combination in a single industry. By completing our Initial Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

◾ | subject us to negative economic, competitive, and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our Initial Business Combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22




◾ | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Initial Business Combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications, or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our Management Team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our Management Team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Initial Business Combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our Initial Business Combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance that members of our Management Team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot provide any assurance that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Initial Business Combination.
Following our Initial Business Combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot provide any assurance that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge, or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. The table below sets forth the types of Initial Business Combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

 | WHETHER STOCKHOLDERAPPROVAL ISREQUIRED | 
Type of Transaction | | 
Purchase of assets | | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the Company | | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the Company | | No 
Merger of the Company with a target | | Yes

​
Under the NYSE’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our Initial Business Combination if, for example:

◾ | we issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | any of our directors, officers, or substantial stockholders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities
If we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsors, Initial Stockholders, directors, officers, advisors, or their respective affiliates may purchase shares or Public Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Initial Business Combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our Initial Stockholders, directors, officers, advisors, or their respective affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the NYSE rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans, or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or Public Warrants in such transactions prior to completion of our Initial Business Combination.
We have adopted an insider trading policy that requires insiders to (i) refrain from purchasing our securities during certain blackout periods when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) clear all trades of company securities prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the Initial Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the Initial Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of Public Warrants could be to reduce the number of Public Warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our Initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing, or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our Sponsors, officers, directors, advisors, and/or any of their respective affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our Sponsors, officers, directors, advisors, or their respective affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests tendered by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our Initial Business Combination. To the extent that our Sponsors, officers, directors, advisors, or their respective affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our Initial Business Combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our Initial Business Combination. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Our Sponsors, officers, directors, advisors, or their respective affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws.

24



Any purchases by our Sponsors, officers, directors, advisors, and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will be made only to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsors, officers, directors, advisors, and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of Common Stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by deferred underwriting commissions that we will pay to the underwriters. Our Sponsors, officers, and directors entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Initial Business Combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding Common Stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE’s stockholder approval rules.
The requirement that we provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares by one of the two methods listed above is contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and applies whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on the NYSE. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our Common Stock entitled to vote thereon.
If we provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will:

◾ | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

25



If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock voted are voted in favor of the Initial Business Combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our Initial Stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsors, officers, and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased in open market and privately negotiated transactions in favor of our Initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of Common Stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our Initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our Initial Stockholders’ Founder Shares, we would need only 10,350,001, or 37.5%, of the 27,600,000 Public Shares sold in our IPO to be voted in favor of an Initial Business Combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our Initial Business Combination approved. We intend to give not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our Initial Business Combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our Initial Stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our Initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will:

◾ | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on Public Stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of deferred underwriters’ commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. If Public Stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the Initial Business Combination.
Upon the public announcement of our Initial Business Combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our Sponsors will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
We intend to require our Public Stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the Initial Business Combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a Public Stockholder seeking redemption of its Public Shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our Public Shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring Public Stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming Public Stockholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed Initial Business Combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target company, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by Public Stockholders who elected to redeem their shares.

26



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. For example, the proposed Initial Business Combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes, or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Public Shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Initial Business Combination or redeem any shares, and all Public Shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our Sponsors. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Initial Business Combination as a means to force us or our Management Team to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a Public Stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our Management Team at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our IPO without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with an Initial Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Initial Business Combination.
Delivering Stock Certificates in Connection with the Exercise of Redemption Rights
As described above, we intend to require our Public Stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the DWAC system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the Initial Business Combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a Public Stockholder seeking redemption of its Public Shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our Public Shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring Public Stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a Public Stockholder would have up to two days prior to the vote on the Initial Business Combination if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their Public Shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.

27



Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of Public Shares delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our Public Shares electing to redeem their shares would be distributed promptly after the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
If our Initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our Public Stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed Initial Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an Initial Business Combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our IPO.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 24 months from the closing of our IPO to complete our Initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within such 24-month period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within the 24-month period.
Our Sponsors, officers, and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO. However, if our Sponsors, officers, or directors acquire Public Shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within the allotted 24-month period.
Our Sponsors, officers, and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or to provide for redemption in connection with a business combination, unless we provide our Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares. However, we may not redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of deferred underwriters’ commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of Public Shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our Public Shares at such time.

28



We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot provide any assurance that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the Trust Account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the Trust Account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds from our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our Public Stockholders. We cannot provide any assurance that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot provide any assurance that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our Public Stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or, even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to enter into an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, Management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the Company, and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if Management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the Company under the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by Management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where Management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. WithumSmith+Brown, PC, our independent registered public accounting firm (“Withum”), and the underwriters of our IPO will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account.

29



In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Upon redemption of our Public Shares, if we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our Initial Business Combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by Public Stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per share initially held in the Trust Account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement entered into by our Sponsors, directors, officers, and us, our Sponsors have agreed that they will be jointly and severally liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable; provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsors to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsors have sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that our Sponsors would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our Initial Business Combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our Initial Business Combination, and our Public Stockholders would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of their Public Shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties, including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest that may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsors assert that they are unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations or that they have no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsors to enforce their indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsors to enforce their indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our Sponsors to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot provide any assurance that our Sponsors would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsors will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses, or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from the Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors.

30



Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our Public Stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provisions for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our Public Stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses, or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest, or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our Sponsors may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest released to us to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsors will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.

31



If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our Public Stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our Board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying Public Stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot provide any assurance that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our Public Stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earlier to occur of (i) the completion of our Initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or to provide for redemption in connection with a business combination; and (iii) the redemption of all of our Public Shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the Initial Business Combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as with all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote.

Comparison of Redemption or Purchase Prices in Connection with Our Initial Business Combination and if We Fail to Complete Our Initial Business Combination
The following table compares the redemptions and other permitted purchases of Public Shares that may take place in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination or if we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO.

 | REDEMPTIONS INCONNECTION WITH OURINITIAL BUSINESSCOMBINATION | OTHER PERMITTEDPURCHASES OF PUBLICSHARES BY US OR OURAFFILIATES | REDEMPTIONS IF WE FAILTO COMPLETE AN INITIALBUSINESS COMBINATION 
Calculation of redemption price | Redemptions at the time of our Initial Business Combination may be made pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a stockholder vote. The same whether we conduct redemptions pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a stockholder vote. In either case, our Public Stockholders may redeem their Public Shares for cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination (which is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share), including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitation that no redemptions will take place if all of the redemptions would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination or any greater limitations (including, but not limited to, cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of the terms of a proposed Initial Business Combination. | If we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, our Sponsors, directors, officers, advisors, or their respective affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market prior to or following completion of our Initial Business Combination. There is no limit to the prices that our Sponsors, directors, officers, advisors, or their respective affiliates may pay in these transactions. Such purchases will be made only to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. | If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, we will redeem all Public Shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (which is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share), including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares.
Impact to remaining stockholders | The redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination will reduce the book value per share for our remaining stockholders, who will bear the burden of the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable. | If the permitted purchases described above are made there would be no impact to our remaining stockholders because the purchase price would not be paid by us. | The redemption of our Public Shares if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination will reduce the book value per share for the shares held by our Initial Stockholders, who will be our only remaining stockholders after such redemptions.

Competition
In identifying, evaluating, and selecting a target business for our Initial Business Combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well-established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human, and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the Initial Business Combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our Public Stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination.
Facilities
Our executive offices are located at 340 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10173, and our telephone number is (212) 468-8655. Our executive offices are provided to us by PNC, an affiliate of PNCIC. We have agreed to pay an affiliate of PNCIC a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative support. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the stage of the Initial Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We registered our Units, Class A common stock, and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an Initial Business Combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our Initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot provide any assurance that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete our Initial Business Combination. We are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our Initial Business Combination.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of  (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
Legal Proceedings
There is no material litigation, arbitration, or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our Management Team in their capacity as such.
