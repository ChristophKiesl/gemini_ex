Item 1.  BUSINESS



(a)  General Description of Business



We are the exclusive United States (“U.S.”) trade co-publisher of educational children’s books produced in the United Kingdom by Usborne Publishing Limited (“Usborne”) and we also exclusively publish books through our ownership of Kane Miller Book Publisher (“Kane Miller”); both award-winning publishers of international children’s books.  We are a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 23, 1965. Our fiscal year ends on February 28 (29).



Our Company motto is “The future of our world depends on the education of our children.  EDC delivers educational excellence one book at a time.  We provide economic opportunity while fostering strong family values.  We touch the lives of children for a lifetime.”



(b)  Financial Information about Our Segments



While selling children’s books and related products (collectively referred to as “books”) is our only line of business, we sell through two business segments, which we sometimes refer to as “divisions”:

● | Home Business Division (“Usborne Books & More” or “UBAM”) – This division sells our books through independent consultants directly to our customers. Our consultants sell books by hosting home parties, through social media collaboration platforms on the internet, by hosting book fairs with school and public libraries and through other events.

● | Publishing Division (“EDC Publishing” or “Publishing”) – This division sells our books to bookstores (including major national chains), toy stores, specialty stores, museums and other retail outlets throughout the country.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business



Products



As the exclusive United States trade co-publisher of Usborne books and sole publisher of Kane Miller books, we offer over 2,000 different children’s books.  Many of our books are interactive in nature, including our touchy-feely board books, activity books and flashcards, adventure and search books, art books, sticker books and foreign language books.  Most of our books were originally published in other countries, in their native languages, and we translate them to common American English and have exclusive rights to publish the titles in the United States.



We also have a broad line of ‘internet-linked’ books which allow readers to expand their educational experience by referring them to relevant non-Company websites.  Our books include science and math titles, as well as chapter books and novels.  We continually introduce new titles across all lines of our products.



UBAM markets our books through commissioned consultants using a combination of direct sales, home parties, book fairs and internet based social media platforms (“online parties”).  This division had approximately 57,600 active consultants as of February 28, 2021.



Our Publishing division markets through commissioned trade representatives who call on retail book, toy, and specialty stores along with other retail outlets. Publishing also conducts in-house marketing by telephone to these customers and potential customers.  This division markets to approximately 4,000 book, toy and specialty stores. Approximately 5% of our Publishing division's net revenues are to national book chain stores.



Seasonality



Sales for both divisions are greatest during the fall due to the holiday season.



Competition



While we have the exclusive U.S. rights to sell Usborne and Kane Miller books, we face competition from the internet and other book publishers who are also selling directly to our customers.  Our UBAM division competes in recruiting and retaining sales consultants, which continuously receive opportunities to work for other direct selling companies, as well as new non-traditional employment opportunities in the gig-marketplace that provide part-time supplemental income. We also compete with Scholastic Corporation in the school and library book fair market.



Our Publishing division faces competition from large U.S. and international publishing companies that sell online and through the same retail publishing stores as well as for space in retail toy, gift and novelty stores that offer a variety of non-book products.



Employees



As of May 3, 2021, 214 full-time employees worked at our Tulsa office and distribution facility and at our San Diego office.  Of these employees, approximately 71% of our employees work in our distribution warehouse. 
Company Reports



Pursuant to Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), we make available, free of charge, on our website (www.edcpub.com) copies of our Annual Reports and Quarterly Reports. Our website also includes an internet link to the federal SEC website that contains additional public reports, including Current Reports on Form 8-K, amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the SEC and reports of holdings of our securities filed by our officers and directors under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. These reports will be provided electronically, free of charge, upon request.

COVID-19 Update



In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China and has since extensively impacted the global health and economic environment. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and President Trump declared the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States as a national emergency. The Company has taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions, in its approach to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure the well-being of our employees, the Company offered employees in our office the ability to work from home on a temporary basis; we instructed employees in our warehouse and office to take their temperature at the start of every shift; we requested employees forgo any in-person meetings and instead opt to utilize virtual meeting spaces; and we published and continually updated our employees on the most recent developments related to COVID-19 and best practices for safety and health in the office, warehouse and at home. On April 16, 2020, the Company entered into a loan with MidFirst Bank as the lender in an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 million pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This loan program provided paycheck protection for our employees from the economic impact to our business due to COVID-19, which was seen most by the decline in our Publishing division’s sales due to the temporary closure of many retail outlets across the country, and in our UBAM division’s School and Library and Book Fair sales due to the temporary closure of many schools nation-wide.  The Company determined the PPP loan was no longer needed and therefore repaid the loan in full on May 12, 2020.  While the Company did not experience a decrease in net revenues during fiscal year 2021 compared with the prior fiscal year 2020, the severity and duration of the pandemic are uncertain and the extent to which our results are affected by COVID-19 cannot be accurately predicted. Effective May 1, 2021, we lessened our safety and health practices in the office and warehouse based on the recommendations from the Tulsa Health Department. We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continually assessing its potential effects on our business. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on the impact COVID-19 had during the current fiscal year.
