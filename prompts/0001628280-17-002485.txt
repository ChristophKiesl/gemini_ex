Item 1. Business.
THE COMPANY
Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Cumberland,” the “Company,” or as used in the context of “we,” “us,” or “our”), is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of branded prescription products. Our primary target markets are hospital acute care and gastroenterology. These medical specialties are characterized by relatively concentrated prescriber bases that we believe can be penetrated effectively by small, targeted sales forces. Cumberland is dedicated to providing innovative products that improve quality of care for patients and address unmet or poorly met medical needs. We promote our approved products through our hospital and gastroenterology sales forces in the United States and are establishing a network of international partners to bring our products to patients in their countries.
Our portfolio of FDA approved brands includes:

• | Acetadote® (acetylcysteine) Injection, for the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning;

• | Portaban™ (ifetroban) oral formulation, a Phase II candidate for the treatment of patients with portal hypertension ("PH") associated with liver disease;


• | Methotrexate (methotrexate) Injection, an approval submission candidate for the treatment of active rheumatoid, juvenile idiopathic and severe psoriatic arthritis, as well as severe disabling psoriasis; and


• | Totect® (dexrazoxane hydrochloride) Injection for emergency oncology intervention, to reverse the toxic effects of anthracycline chemotherapy in case of extravasation (drug leakage from the bloodstream into the tissues).

We have both product development and commercial capabilities, and believe we can leverage our existing infrastructure to support our expected growth. Our management team consists of pharmaceutical industry veterans experienced in business development, product development, regulatory, manufacturing, sales, marketing and finance. 
1

Our business development team identifies, evaluates and negotiates product acquisition, licensing and co-promotion opportunities. Our product development team creates proprietary product formulations, manages our clinical studies, prepares all regulatory submissions and manages our medical call center. Our quality and manufacturing professionals oversee the manufacture, release and shipment of our products. Our marketing and sales professionals are responsible for our commercial activities, and we work closely with our distribution partners to ensure availability and delivery of our products.
Cumberland's growth strategy involves maximizing the potential of our existing brands while continuing to build a portfolio of differentiated products. We currently market six FDA-approved products for sale in the United States. Through our international partners, we are working to bring our products to patients in countries outside the U.S. We also look for opportunities to expand our products into additional patient populations through clinical trials, new indications, and select investigator-initiated studies. We actively pursue opportunities to acquire additional marketed products as well as late-stage development product candidates in our target medical specialties. Further, we are supplementing these activities with the pipeline drug development activities at Cumberland Emerging Technologies ("CET"), our majority-owned subsidiary. CET partners with universities and other research organizations to identify and progress promising, early-stage product candidates, which Cumberland has the opportunity to further develop and commercialize.
We were incorporated in 1999 and have been headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee since inception. During 2009, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock and listing on the NASDAQ exchange. Our website address is www.cumberlandpharma.com. We make available through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all other press releases, filings and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after their filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (“SEC”). These filings are also available to the public at www.sec.gov.

Acetadote®
Acetadote is an intravenous formulation of N-acetylcysteine, indicated for the treatment of the liver toxicity associated with acetaminophen poisoning. Acetadote, has been available in the United States since Cumberland's 2004 introduction of the product through our hospital sales force. Acetadote is typically used in hospital emergency departments to prevent or lessen potential liver damage resulting from an overdose of acetaminophen, a common ingredient in many over-the-counter and prescription pain relieving and fever-reducing products. Acetaminophen continues to be the leading cause of poisonings reported by hospital emergency departments in the United States, and Acetadote has become a standard of care for treating this potentially life-threatening condition.
Acetadote received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval as an orphan drug, which provided seven years of marketing exclusivity from the date of approval. In connection with the FDA's approval of Acetadote, we committed to certain post-marketing activities for the product. Completion of our first Phase IV commitment resulted in the FDA's 2006 approval of expanded labeling for the product for use in pediatric patients. Completion of our second Phase IV commitment resulted in further revised labeling for the product with FDA approval of additional safety data in 2008. Completion of our third and final Phase IV commitment in 2010 culminated in the FDA’s approval of a new formulation for the product. The next generation formulation, contains no ethylene diamine tetracetic acid ("EDTA") or other stabilization agent, chelating agent or preservative. In early 2011, Cumberland introduced this new Acetadote formulation replacing the original form of the product which we no longer manufacture.
In June 2013, the FDA approved updated labeling for Acetadote revising the product's indication and providing new dosing guidance for specific patient populations. As a result, dosing guidance is now included for patients weighing over 100 kg and new language has been added to alert health care providers that in certain clinical situations, therapy should be extended for some patients.
Beginning in 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the "USPTO") issued us a series of patents associated with our Acetadote product. These patents are discussed in Part I, Item I, "Business - Trademarks and Patents" of this Form 10-K. On November 8, 2012, we learned that the FDA approved an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filed by InnoPharma, Inc. and referencing Acetadote. That product, with the old formulation containing EDTA, was subsequently introduced by APP, a division of Fresenius Kabi USA, at the end of 2012. In early 2013, we entered into an agreement with Perrigo Company resulting in the distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection (our "Authorized Generic") product. Both Acetadote and our Authorized Generic utilize the new, EDTA-free formulation which accounted for continued significant market share during 2016. 
In November 2015, an Illinois judge issued a final ruling in favor of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. in a patent case associated with Acetadote. By ruling in Cumberland's favor, the court upheld the validity of the patent which encompasses our EDTA-Free formulation and has a term until August 2025. The court also granted a permanent injunction preventing challengers from marketing a generic version of our proprietary Acetadote product formulation before the expiration of Cumberland’s patent in August 2025.
On January 26, 2017, an Appeals Court affirmed the District Court ruling in the Company's favor upholding Cumberland's Acetadote patent and expressly rejected the validity challenge.
Caldolor®
Caldolor, our intravenous formulation of ibuprofen, was the first injectable product approved in the U.S. for the treatment of both pain and fever. We conducted a series of clinical studies in over nine hundred adult patients to develop the data to support our FDA submission for the product's registration. The FDA approved Caldolor for marketing in the United States during the middle portion of 2009 following a priority review. The product was indicated for use by adults for the management of mild to moderate pain and the management of moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics. It was also the first FDA-approved intravenous therapy for treating fever. 
In late 2009, we launched Caldolor and stocked the product at major wholesalers serving hospitals nationwide. We initially worked to establish a core group of medical facilities approving and purchasing the product and then focused on building more sales volume and treating a broader range of patients within those stocked facilities. We promote Caldolor in the United States through our dedicated hospital sales force. By the end of 2016, Caldolor had been purchased by nearly 1,400 health care facilities in the U.S.
3

We completed a series of Phase IV studies to gather additional data to support our Caldolor product. Those clinical trials involved another 1,000 patients, adult and pediatric patients. These studies included data on a shortened infusion time and pre-surgical administration of the product. To address our Phase IV commitment to the FDA, these studies also included evaluation of the product for the reduction of fever in hospitalized children and the treatment of pain in children undergoing tonsillectomy surgeries. Information from these Phase IV studies, including an updated integrated safety database, was submitted to the FDA in early 2015 with a request for updated product labeling. 
In late 2015, we received FDA approval for the use of Caldolor in pediatric patients six months of age and older. Caldolor is the first and only injectable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) approved for use in children. We also continue to pursue and evaluate potential improvements to the product’s packaging. In March 2016, we began promotion of Caldolor for this pediatric indication. Also in 2016 we reached agreement with the FDA on the design of another Phase IV study evaluating the product in newborns and infants less than six month of age. We then started the implementation of that study. We also continue to pursue and evaluate potential improvements to the product’s presentation and continue to support a series of investigator initiated studies with related publications. 
Kristalose®
Kristalose is a prescription laxative administered orally for the treatment of acute and chronic constipation. An innovative, dry powder crystalline formulation of lactulose, Kristalose is designed to enhance patient acceptance and compliance. Kristalose is the only prescription laxative available in pre-measured powder packets. Kristalose dissolves easily in four ounces of water, offering patients a virtually taste-free, grit-free and essentially calorie-free alternative to lactulose syrups. We conducted a preference study which indicated that seventy-seven percent of patients surveyed prefer the taste, consistency and portability of Kristalose over similar products in syrup forms.
We acquired exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to Kristalose in 2006, assembled a dedicated field sales force and re-launched it in September 2006 as a Cumberland brand. We direct our sales efforts to physicians who are the most prolific writers of prescription laxatives, including gastroenterologists and internists. We supplement this personal promotion with telemarketing campaigns to expand our reach and support of the product.
In late 2011, through a series of transactions, we entered into an agreement with Mylan Inc. to acquire certain assets associated with the Kristalose brand including the Kristalose trademark and the FDA registration. During 2014, we also entered into a long-term supply agreement and new packaging agreements for the product. By entering into these transactions, we streamlined the supply chain for the product and are exploring opportunities to further develop the brand.
Using the preference data as a cornerstone of our marketing efforts, we have made significant gains following our repositioning of the brand in early 2014. The new marketing strategy includes an enhanced patient coupon program and expanded managed care coverage for the product. During 2015 and 2016, we worked to expand and improve the contract terms for the product’s managed care coverage.
Omeclamox®-Pak
Many ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract are caused by an infection from the Helicobacter pylori (“H. pylori”) bacterium. Omeclamox-Pak is a branded prescription product used for the treatment of these infections and the related duodenal ulcer disease. This innovative product combines three well-known and widely prescribed medications: omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Omeclamox-Pak was the first FDA approved triple therapy combination medication to contain omeprazole as the proton pump inhibitor, which works to decrease the amount of acid the stomach produces. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are both antibiotic agents which hinder the growth of the H. pylori bacteria. Interaction of these agents allows the stomach lining to heal effectively. The medications are packaged together on convenient daily dosing cards, making it simple to follow the twice a day dosing before meals.
While there are competing combination products, Omeclamox-Pak is one of the few actively marketed brands for this condition. In addition, compared to the competitors, Omeclamox-Pak involves the lowest pill burden and fewest days of therapy. Our involvement with Omeclamox-Pak began in October 2013, through a co-promotion agreement with Pernix Therapeutics ("Pernix"). In November 2015, Cumberland entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement with Gastro-Entero Logic, LLC (“GEL”), assumed full commercial responsibility for Omeclamox-Pak in 
4

the United States, and concluded our agreements with Pernix. Cumberland is now responsible for the supply chain, national accounts and all sales promotion of Omeclamox-Pak as part of the GEL agreement. 
Our field sales force promotes Omeclamox-Pak to the gastroenterologist segment, which accounts for the largest component of the prescriber base for this product. We supplement this personal promotion through telemarketing campaigns to expand the support and use of the product. During 2016, we established a series of contracts to provide managed care coverage for Omeclamox-Pak. Cumberland is also seeking a new co-promotion partner to support the product with primary care physicians who were previously covered by Pernix.
Vaprisol®
In early 2014, we entered into an agreement with Astellas Pharma US, Inc. ("Astellas") to acquire Vaprisol, including certain product rights, intellectual property and related assets. Vaprisol is a prescription brand indicated to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The product was developed and registered by Astellas and then launched in 2006. It is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the only intravenously administered branded treatment. 
Hyponatremia, an imbalance of serum sodium to body water, is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. These electrolyte disturbances occur when the sodium ion concentration in the plasma is lower than normal and are often associated with a variety of critical care conditions including congestive heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure and pneumonia. Vaprisol raises serum sodium to appropriate levels and promotes free water secretion. 
We re-launched active promotion of the brand during the middle of 2014 utilizing our hospital sales force supported by a series of marketing initiatives. 
Ethyol®
In May 2016, the Company announced an agreement with Clinigen Group Plc ("Clinigen") in which Cumberland acquired the exclusive rights to commercialize Ethyol in the United States. Ethyol is a FDA approved cytoprotective drug containing amifostine for injection. It is indicated as an adjuvant therapy to reduce the incidence of xerostomia (dry mouth) as a side-effect in patients undergoing post-operative radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. It also reduces the cumulative renal toxicity associated with the repeated administration of cisplatin in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, Cumberland is responsible for all marketing, promotion, and distribution of the product in the United States. 
In August 2016, we began distribution of Ethyol for injection to wholesalers within the U.S. and in September 2016, we launched the national promotional support for the brand. Ethyol is Cumberland's first oncology product and complements our current hospital product line. 
Hepatoren®
In 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire the rights to ifetroban, a new Phase II product candidate. Our acquisition of the rights to the ifetroban program includes an extensive clinical database and non-clinical data package as well as manufacturing processes, know-how and intellectual property. Ifetroban was initially developed by a large pharmaceutical company for significant cardiovascular indications. That company conducted extensive studies for their target indications and eventually donated the entire program to Vanderbilt University. Researchers at Vanderbilt identified ifetroban as a potentially valuable compound in treating patients for several niche indications. Cumberland acquired the rights to the ifetroban program from Vanderbilt through CET with the intention to develop the product for several potential new indications.
We have commenced manufacturing of an intravenous formulation of ifetroban and the FDA has cleared our IND application for this product candidate. We have initiated clinical development under the brand name Hepatoren and are evaluating this candidate for the treatment of critically ill hospitalized patients suffering from hepatorenal syndrome ("HRS"). HRS is a life threatening condition, with a high mortality rate and no approved pharmaceutical therapy in the U.S.
5

We completed a sixty-four patient Phase II study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of Hepatoren in HRS patients. Progression to higher dose levels was reviewed and approved by an independent safety committee. The study was stratified into Type I or Type II patients with HRS based upon the progression of their disease.
Top line results from this study indicated that Hepatoren was overall well tolerated in the HRS patients with no safety concerns noted. Furthermore, the Type II patients receiving the higher dose levels of Hepatoren were more likely to experience increases in urine output, a signal of improved kidney function, compared to patients who received placebo.
In 2016, we completed the data analysis and reports from this study and began planning the next steps for this development program which are expected to include a Phase II efficacy trial. With favorable results from that study we would expect to seek orphan drug status for this unmet medical need. 
Boxaban®
We have also completed the manufacturing of an oral formulation of ifetroban and the FDA has cleared an IND amendment for this product candidate. We have initiated clinical development under the brand name Boxaban, evaluating this candidate for patients suffering from aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Also known as Samter’s Triad, AERD is a respiratory disease involving chronic asthma and nasal polyposis that is worsened by aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Approximately one in twenty asthmatic adults in the U.S. suffer from AERD and awareness of the disease is growing within the medical community. There is no U.S. approved pharmaceutical treatment for AERD.
We completed a Phase II clinical study designed to gather initial safety and tolerability data on Boxaban in AERD patients. It was a multicenter study of sixteen patients with enrollment at several U.S. medical centers including the Scripps Clinic. Results indicate that no adverse events were experienced by patients receiving Boxaban when compared to those receiving placebo. Boxaban was well tolerated and safe for subjects with a history of AERD.
We have completed the data analysis and reports for this study in 2016, while also planning the next steps for this program which are expected to include a follow-on Phase II trial. With favorable results from that study, we would expect to explore orphan drug status to help address this unmet medical need.
VasculanTM
In April 2016, we announced the addition of Vasculan to our pipeline. Through Cumberland's ifetroban program, Cumberland has initiated the clinical development of ifetroban oral capsules for the treatment of systemic sclerosis. 
Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also called scleroderma, is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and internal organs. It is characterized by vasculopathy, inflammation, and fibrosis. This disease has a high morbidity and the highest case-specific mortality of any rheumatic disorder with 50% of patients dying or developing major internal organ complications within 3 years of diagnosis. 
Although several medications are used to treat the skin disease associated with SSc, there is no universally effective treatment to improve the function of affected internal organs such as the lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal tract.
During 2016, the FDA cleared our investigational new drug application (IND) for a Phase II clinical program for Vasculan in patients with systemic sclerosis. We subsequently began the process of initiating the trial at medical centers across the U.S.
Portaban®
In September 2016, we announced the addition of Portaban to our pipeline. Cumberland has initiated the clinical development of injectable and oral formulations of ifetroban for the treatment of portal hypertension associated with liver disease. Preclinical studies have shown ifetroban can reduce portal pressure, necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in multiple models of liver injury.
6

The FDA cleared our IND for a Phase II clinical study evaluating Portaban in patients with portal hypertension during 2016. We then began initiating that trial at several medical centers in the U.S.
Methotrexate
In November 2016, we announced that we had entered into an Agreement to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to Nordic Group B.V.'s injectable methotrexate product line. The products are designed for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, severe psoriatic arthritis, and severe disabling psoriasis. The product line is approved for patient use in various European countries. Cumberland will register the products, and following FDA approval, commercialize those methotrexate products in the U.S.
Totect®
In January 2017, we announced an exclusive agreement to commercialize the oncology support drug, Totect in the U.S. It is an FDA approved injectable formulation of dexrazoxane hydrochloride used to reverse the toxic effects of extravasation that can result from intravenous anthracycline chemotherapy for certain cancer patients. Extravasation occurs when an injected medicine escapes from the blood vessels and circulates into tissues in the body. This leakage can cause severe tissue damage and result in serious complications for the cancer patients involved. Administration of Totect can reverse such damage caused by anthracycline extravasation, without the requirement for additional surgeries and procedures. The product can enable patients to continue their anti-cancer treatment without significant interruption.

 Totect is the second product we have licensed from Clinigen and under the terms of the agreements, we will be responsible for all marketing, promotion, and distribution of the product in the U.S. Clinigen is planning to register a new supplier of the product with the FDA and once that manufacturer is cleared, we expect to receive initial product supplies and launch the product.
OUR STRATEGY
Continue to build a high-performance sales organization to address our target markets
We believe that our commercial infrastructure can help drive prescription volume and product sales. We currently utilize two distinct sales teams to address our primary target markets: a hospital sales force for the acute care market and a field sales force for the gastroenterology market. We believe that active promotion of our products, supported by non-personal promotional activities developed and implemented by our marketing team, can maximize the opportunity for our brands. 
Further develop our existing products and develop new late stage product candidates
We continue to evaluate our products following FDA approval to determine if further clinical work could expand the potential market opportunities for our products and help new patient populations. We will continue to explore opportunities for label expansion to bring our products to new patient populations. The Caldolor pediatric approval reflects our successful implementation of this strategy. Our clinical team is also working to develop late stage product candidates that could further expand our product portfolio if approved by the FDA. 
Expand our product portfolio by acquiring rights to additional products and late-stage product candidates
In addition to our product development activities, we are also seeking to acquire products or late-stage development product candidates to continue to build a portfolio of complementary brands. We focus on under-promoted, FDA-approved drugs as well as late-stage development products that address poorly met medical needs. We plan to continue to target product acquisition candidates that are competitively differentiated, have valuable intellectual property or other protective features, and allow us to leverage our existing infrastructure. Our acquisitions of rights to Ethyol and Totect in the U.S. represent recent examples of our implementation of this strategy.
Expand our global presence through select international partnerships
We have established our own commercial capabilities, including a sales organization to cover the U.S. market for our products. We are building a network of select international partners to register our products and make them available to patients in their countries. We will continue to expand our network of international partners and continue to support 
7

our partners’ registration and commercialization efforts in their respective territories. The launch of Caldolor in Australia by CSL's Seqirus is an example of our international partnerships. 
Develop a pipeline of early-stage products through Cumberland Emerging Technologies ("CET")
In order to build our product pipeline, we are supplementing our acquisition and late-stage development activities with the early-stage drug development activities at CET. CET partners with universities and other research organizations to develop promising, early-stage product candidates, and Cumberland has the opportunity to negotiate rights to further develop and commercialize them in the U.S and other markets.
SALES AND MARKETING
Our sales and marketing team has broad industry experience in selling branded pharmaceuticals. Our sales and marketing professionals manage our dedicated hospital and gastroenterology sales forces, including approximately 50 sales representatives and district managers, direct our national marketing campaigns and maintain key national account relationships. 
Hospital market: We promote Caldolor, Vaprisol, Acetadote, and Ethyol through our dedicated hospital sales team. This team targets key hospitals across the U.S. and is comprised of sales professionals with substantial experience in the hospital market. Outside market data continues to indicate that the majority of pharmaceutical promotional spending is directed toward large, outpatient markets on drugs intended for chronic use rather than short-term, hospital use. We believe the hospital market is under-served and highly concentrated, and that it can be penetrated effectively by a small, dedicated sales force without large-scale promotional activity. Our position within the acute care market and existing hospital sales team provided the rationale for adding Ethyol as our first oncology product and a complementary product to our current hospital product line. Our strategy has been to increase the focus of our hospital sales team on targeted, high priority accounts. 
Gastroenterology market: We promote Kristalose and Omeclamox-Pak through a dedicated field sales team addressing a targeted group of physicians who are large prescribers of both products. Because the market for gastrointestinal diseases is broad in patient scope, yet relatively narrow in physician base, we believe it provides product opportunities that can be penetrated with a modest sized sales force. By investing in our sales and marketing activities we believe that we can increase market share for both products. Our focus on the gastroenterology market and our existing field sales infrastructure provided us with the rationale to add Omeclamox-Pak. Our field sales force now features both Kristalose and Omeclamox-Pak during most of their physician calls, expanding our presence in the gastroenterology market.
Our sales and marketing executives conduct ongoing market analysis to evaluate marketing campaigns and promotional programs. The evaluations include development of product profiles, testing of the profiles against the needs of the market, determining what additional product information or development work is needed to effectively market the products and preparing financial forecasts. We utilize professional branding and packaging as well as promotional items to support our products, including direct mail, sales brochures, journal advertising, educational and reminder leave-behinds, patient educational pieces, coupons, and product sampling. We also regularly attend targeted trade shows to promote broad awareness of our products. Our national accounts group is responsible for key large buyers and related marketing programs. This group supports sales and marketing efforts by maintaining relationships with our wholesaler customers as well as with third-party payors such as group purchasing organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, hospital buying groups, state and federal government purchasers and health insurance companies. 
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS
We have established our own capabilities to support the commercialization of our products in the U.S. Our international strategy is to identify and partner with other companies that have the appropriate capabilities to support our products in their respective countries. We have entered into a series of agreements to establish an international network, which is summarized in the table below and includes information on the company, licensed product, territory and status:

CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT 
Vasculan Program
In April 2016, we announced the addition of Vasculan to our pipeline. Cumberland has initiated the clinical development of Vasculan for the treatment of systemic sclerosis. The FDA has cleared our IND for a Phase II clinical program for Vasculan in patients with systemic sclerosis.
Caldolor Pediatric Study
We reached agreement with the FDA in 2016 on the design of a study to gather data on the use of Caldolor in infants and newborns less than six months of age. We then started planning for initiation of that trial. That development follows FDA approval for the use of Caldolor for pain and fever in children six months of age and older in late 2015.
Caldolor Pediatric Fever Manuscript
In February 2017, we announced the publication of a multicenter clinical study demonstrating that Caldolor Injection delivered significant fever reduction in hospitalized children. This study, which adds to the growing body of literature supporting Caldolor, evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous ibuprofen in pediatric patients, six months and older, with fever. This pivotal data published in the British BMC Pediatrics Journal supported the FDA approval of Caldolor for use in this pediatric patient population. 
Vaprisol Dose Comparison Manuscript
In February 2016, we announced the publication of an open label multicenter study that supports Vaprisol injection. The study evaluated both 20 and 40 mg/day doses of conivaptan in hyponatremic patients and was conducted at 26 U.S. and 2 international centers. A total of 251 patients were enrolled in the study. The publication is available in the journal Drug Design, Development and Therapy.

Hepatoren Program
We are developing Hepatoren as a potential treatment for Hepatorenal Syndrome ("HRS") - a life threatening condition, with a high mortality rate and no approved pharmaceutical therapy in this country. We initiated a sixty-four patient Phase II study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Hepatoren for this unmet medical need.
The study was designed to evaluate escalating dose levels of Hepatoren in HRS patients. Progression to higher dose levels is reviewed and approved by an independent safety committee. The study was stratified into Type I or Type II patients with HRS based upon the progression of their disease.
Top line results from this study indicated that Hepatoren was overall well tolerated in the HRS patients with no safety concerns noted. Furthermore, the Type II patients receiving the higher dose levels of Hepatoren were more likely to experience increases in urine output, a signal of improved kidney function, compared to patients who received placebo.
We have completed the data analysis and reports from this study and are planning the next steps for this development program which are expected to include a follow on Phase II efficacy trial.
Boxaban Program
We are developing Boxaban for the treatment of Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease ("AERD"), a respiratory disease involving chronic asthma and nasal polyposis that is worsened by aspirin. AERD is characterized by sharp increases in inflammatory mediators and platelet activity within the respiratory system. Ifetroban, an active thromboxane receptor antagonist, may interfere with these pathways to modify the disease and provide symptomatic relief.
We completed manufacturing of Boxaban oral capsules and completed a Phase II clinical study to evaluate Boxaban in patients suffering AERD. The study was designed to gather initial safety and tolerability data on ifetroban in AERD patients. It was a multicenter study of sixteen patients with enrollment at several U.S. medical centers including the Scripps Clinic. Results indicate that no adverse events were experienced by patients receiving Boxaban when compared to those receiving placebo. Boxaban was well tolerated and safe for subjects with a history of AERD.
We have completed the data analysis and reports for this study while also planning the next steps for this program which are expected to also include a follow on Phase II study.
Portaban Program
In September 2016, we announced the addition of Portaban to our pipeline. Cumberland has initiated the clinical development of Portaban for the treatment of portal hypertension associated with liver disease. The FDA has cleared our IND for a Phase II clinical program for Portaban. Preclinical studies have shown ifetroban can reduce portal pressure, necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in multiple models of liver injury.
New Hospital Product Candidate
Cumberland was responsible for the formulation, development and FDA approval of both Acetadote and Caldolor. Our Medical Advisory Board has helped us identify additional opportunities that address unmet or poorly met medical needs. As a result, we have targeted a cholesterol reducing agent for use in the hospital setting. Cumberland has successfully designed, formulated and completed the preclinical studies for this product candidate. In October 2016, the FDA cleared the related IND and we initiated a Phase I study in healthy volunteers to determine the pharmacokinetic and safety profile for this new product candidate.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Since inception, we have had an active business development program focused on acquiring rights to marketed products and product candidates that fit our strategy and target markets. We source business development opportunities through our international network of advisory firms and individual pharmaceutical industry and medical advisors. A multi-disciplinary internal management team reviews these opportunities on a regular basis using a list of selection criteria. We have historically focused on product opportunities that are a strategic fit with our commercial organization, 
11

development expertise and medical focus, employing a variety of transaction structures. Our additions of Omeclamox-Pak, Vaprisol, Ethyol, and Totect reflect our business development process and follow our selection criteria. 
We intend to continue to build a portfolio of complementary, niche products largely through product acquisitions and late-stage product development. Our primary targets are under-promoted, FDA-approved drugs with existing brand recognition and late-stage development product candidates that address unmet or poorly met medical needs in the hospital acute care and gastroenterology markets. We believe that by focusing mainly on approved or late-stage products, we can minimize the significant risk, cost and time associated with drug development. 
Clinigen Strategic Alliance
In September 2015, we announced a strategic alliance with Clinigen, an international firm headquartered in London. Clinigen is a specialty pharmaceutical and services company focused on providing medicines to patients with high unmet needs through registered, clinical trials and compassionate use supply. Under the terms of the alliance, Cumberland will commercialize select Clinigen products in the U.S. and Clinigen will support select Cumberland products in international markets where we do not have a distribution partner. The terms of each such product arrangement will be addressed through an additional agreement.
In May 2016, we announced an agreement with Clinigen under which we acquired exclusive rights to Ethyol® in the U.S. Under the terms of the agreement, we are responsible for all marketing, promotion, and distribution of the product in our territory. This is the first product to be licensed by us from Clinigen") under our strategic alliance.
In January 2017, we announced an exclusive agreement to acquire exclusive rights to Totect® in the U. S. This was the second product Clinigen has licensed to us under our strategic alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be responsible for all marketing, promotion, and distribution of the product in this country.
Nordic Group B.V. Agreement
In November 2016, we announced our agreement to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to Nordic Group B.V.'s injectable methotrexate product line. The products are designed for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, severe psoriatic arthritis, and severe disabling psoriasis. The product line is approved for patient use in various European countries. Cumberland will register and commercialize the methotrexate products in the United States. 
CET Collaboration
Through CET, we collaborate with a select group of academic research institutions located in the mid-south region of the U.S. Our business development team is responsible for identifying appropriate CET product candidates and negotiating with our university partners to secure rights to these candidates. Although we believe that these collaborations may be important to our business in the future, they are not material to our business at this time.
CET currently has collaboration agreements with Universities to co-develop promising biomedical technologies, including: Vanderbilt University, the University of Tennessee and the University of Mississippi.
These agreements allow us to play an important role in fostering and shaping early-stage biomedical research to improve patient care and provide CET and Cumberland with access to promising pipeline candidates such as Hepatoren, Boxaban, Vasculan, and Portaban.
MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION
We partner with third parties for certain non-core, capital-intensive functions, including manufacturing and distribution. Our executives are experienced in these areas and manage these third-party relationships with a focus on quality assurance and timely delivery.
12

Manufacturing
Our key manufacturing relationships include:
Caldolor®

• | We have agreements with three manufacturers for the commercial supply of Caldolor and two of the three suppliers have manufactured inventory under these agreements. We obtained commercial supply from two of these manufacturers during 2016 for both our international and domestic Caldolor markets.

Acetadote®

• | During the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into a three-year agreement with a U.S. based manufacturer to supply our Acetadote product. We transferred the Acetadote manufacturing process to this supplier and we have received and sold commercial units from this supplier since 2015. We recently extended the relationship with the supplier for periods beyond the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Kristalose®

• | We have an agreement for the purchase of Kristalose API with an international supplier. This written agreement formalized and extended our existing relationship with this raw materials supplier. We also have manufacturing relationships with two Kristalose packagers. Under these agreements, we provide Kristalose API to these manufactures and they package the API (for both commercial sale and samples) into 10 gram and 20 gram finished product units for our purchase and distribution. 

Omeclamox®-Pak

• | Based on our agreement with GEL, effective in November 2015, Cumberland assumed supply chain responsibilities and now works directly with GEL for the manufacture, packaging and supply of Omeclamox-Pak commercial and sample units.

Vaprisol®

• | As part of the acquisition of Vaprisol, we purchased an existing supply of raw material inventory. In addition, as part of this transaction, we were assigned a commercial supply agreement with the existing manufacturer who provided supplies of Vaprisol. That manufacturer continues to supply commercial inventory to Cumberland under this agreement. 

Ethyol®

• | As part of the Ethyol transaction, we were assigned a commercial supply agreement with the existing manufacturer used to prepare, package, and inspect the Ethyol product. The manufacturer continues to supply commercial inventory to Cumberland under this agreement.

Distribution
Like many other pharmaceutical companies, we engage a third party contractor with appropriate facilities and logistical expertise to support our distribution efforts. Since August 2002, Cardinal Health ("Cardinal") has exclusively handled U.S. product logistics efforts, including warehousing, shipping, customer billing and collections. 
We extended our distribution relationship with Cardinal during May 2013, when we entered into the First Amendment ("First Amendment") to the Exclusive Distribution Agreement under which we have operated since August 2010. The First Amendment primarily served to extend the term of the Agreement through June 30, 2016 and revised the fee schedule under the Agreement. Under the Amendment, we have also engaged Cardinal to assist with our physician sample orders based on the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (the “PDMA”) for samples shipping. On June 30, 2016, the contract automatically renewed on a year-to-year basis and is now terminable by either party with ninety days' notice. Under the First Amendment and Agreement, Cardinal agrees to provide various services, including storage, distribution, returns, customer support, and system access support to us in connection with the distribution of our products under certain guidelines at established fees. 
13

Our primary customers are wholesaler pharmaceutical distributors in the United States. Total gross revenue for our top four customers at December 31, 2016 total 89%.
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
We own all the trademarks for each of our branded pharmaceutical products as well as for our corporate name and logo. We have applied for trademark registration for various other names and logos. Over time, we intend to maintain registrations on trademarks that remain valuable to our business.
We seek to protect our products from competition through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure. Proprietary rights, including patents, are an important element of our business. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute agreements providing for protection of our confidential information upon commencement of their employment or engagement. We also require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials.
Acetadote®
We developed a new formulation of Acetadote (acetylcysteine) Injection as part of a Phase IV commitment in response to a request by the FDA to evaluate the reduction of EDTA from the product's formulation. In April 2012, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,148,356 (the “356 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 356 Acetadote Patent encompasses the Acetadote formulation and includes composition of matter claims. Following its issuance, the 356 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 356 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in May 2026, which time period includes a 270-day patent term adjustment granted by the USPTO.
Following the issuance of the 356 Acetadote Patent, we received separate Paragraph IV certification notices from InnoPharma, Inc. ("InnoPharma"), Paddock Laboratories, LLC (“Paddock”), Mylan Institutional LLC (“Mylan”), Sagent Agila LLC ("Sagent") and Perrigo Company ("Perrigo") challenging the 356 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement and/or invalidity. We responded by filing five separate infringement lawsuits, in the appropriate United States District Courts, to contest each of the challenges. 
On November 12, 2012, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Paddock and Perrigo to resolve the challenges and the pending litigation with those two companies. On November 1, 2013, the United States District Court filed opinions granting Sagent’s and InnoPharma’s motions to dismiss our suits and we agreed not to file an appeal or motion to reconsider, thereby resolving the challenges and the pending litigation with those two companies. 
Under the Settlement Agreement, Paddock and Perrigo admit that the 356 Acetadote Patent is valid and enforceable and that any Paddock or Perrigo generic Acetadote product (with or without EDTA) would infringe upon the 356 Acetadote Patent. In addition, Paddock and Perrigo will not challenge the validity, enforceability, ownership or patentability of the 356 Acetadote Patent through its expiration currently scheduled for May 2026. On November 12, 2012, in connection with the execution of the Settlement Agreement, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo (the “License and Supply Agreement”). Under the terms of the License and Supply Agreement, once a third party receives final approval from the FDA for an ANDA to sell a generic Acetadote product and such third party made such generic version available for purchase in commercial quantities in the United States, we supply Perrigo with an Authorized Generic version of our Acetadote product. 
On May 18, 2012, we also submitted a Citizen Petition to the FDA requesting that the FDA refrain from approving any applications for acetylcysteine injection that contain EDTA, based in part on the FDA's request that we evaluate the reduction or removal of EDTA from its original Acetadote formulation. On November 7, 2012, the FDA responded to the Citizen Petition denying our request and on November 8, 2012, we learned that the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. We brought suit against the FDA contesting the FDA's decision to approve the InnoPharma generic on November 13, 2012. On September 30, 2013, the United States District Court filed an opinion granting a summary judgment in favor of the FDA regarding this suit.
As noted above, during 2012 the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. Upon this condition, in accordance with the License and Supply agreement with Perrigo, we began to supply Perrigo with 
14

our Authorized Generic. On January 7, 2013, Perrigo announced initial distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection product.
On March 19, 2013, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,399,445 (the “445 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 445 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acetaminophen overdose. On April 8, 2013, the 445 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 445 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025. Following the issuance of the 445 Acetadote Patent we received separate Paragraph IV certification notices from Perrigo, Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Mylan challenging the 445 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement, unenforceability and/or invalidity.
On June 10, 2013, we became aware of a Paragraph IV certification notice from Akorn, Inc. challenging the 445 Acetadote Patent and the 356 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement.

On February18, 2014, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,653,061 (the “061 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to the Company. The claims of the 061 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acetaminophen overdose. Following its issuance, the 061 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 061 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025.
On May 13, 2014, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,722,738 (the “738 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to Cumberland. The claims of the 738 Acetadote Patent encompass administration methods of acetylcysteine injection, without specification of the presence or lack of EDTA in the injection. Following its issuance, the 738 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book and it is scheduled to expire in April 2032. 
On December 11, 2014 and March 3, 2015, the Company became aware of Paragraph IV certification notices from Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc., respectively, challenging the 356, 445, 061, and 738 Acetadote Patents on the basis of non-infringement.
On February 10, 2015, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,952,065 (the “065 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 065 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acute liver failure. The 065 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025.
On September 30, 2015, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division ("District Court") ruled in our favor in our lawsuit against Mylan for infringement of the 445 Acetadote Patent. The opinion upheld our 445 Acetadote Patent and expressly rejected Mylan's validity challenge. The District Court ruled that Mylan is liable to us for infringement of the 445 Acetadote patent in light of Mylan's Abbreviated New Drug Application in which Mylan sought to market a generic version of Acetadote. On November 17, 2015, the District Court entered an order enjoining Mylan and its affiliates from selling or using its generic version of Acetadote until August 2025, the date of expiration of the 445 Acetadote Patent. On October 30, 2015, Mylan filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the "Appeals Court").
On May 3, 2016, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 9,327,028 (the “028 Acetadote Patent”) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 028 Acetadote Patent encompass administration methods of acetylcysteine injection, without specification of the presence or lack of EDTA in the injection. Following its issuance, the 028 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book and it is scheduled to expire in July 2031.
On January 26, 2017, the Appeals Court affirmed the District Court ruling in the Company's favor in its lawsuit against Mylan for infringement of the 445 Acetadote Patent. The Appeals Court opinion affirmed the District Court’s ruling upholding Cumberland's 445 Acetadote Patent and expressly rejected Mylan's validity challenge.
We are considering our legal options and intend to continue to vigorously defend and protect our Acetadote product and related intellectual property rights.

We have licensed the injectable methotrexate products and are not aware of any patents issued for those products.
COMPETITION
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our continued success in developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products will depend, in part, upon our ability to compete against existing and future products in our target markets. Competitive factors directly affecting our markets include but are not limited to: 

• | product attributes such as efficacy, safety, ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness;


• | brand awareness and recognition driven by sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;


• | intellectual property and other exclusivity rights;


• | availability of resources to build and maintain developmental and commercial capabilities;


• | successful business development activities;


• | extent of third-party reimbursements; and


• | establishment of advantageous collaborations to conduct development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts.

A number of our competitors possess research and development and sales and marketing capabilities as well as financial resources greater than ours. These competitors, in addition to emerging companies and academic research institutions, may be developing, or in the future could develop, new technologies that could compete with our current and future products or render our products obsolete.
Acetadote®
Acetadote is our injectable formulation of NAC for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. NAC is accepted worldwide as the standard of care for acetaminophen overdose. Our competitors in the acetaminophen overdose market are those companies selling orally administered NAC including, but not limited to, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bedford Laboratories division of Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc., Roxane Laboratories, Inc., InnoPharma Inc. and Hospira Inc.
In November 2012, InnoPharma Inc. was granted approval by the FDA to distribute their generic form of the old formulation of Acetadote containing EDTA. In late 2012, we entered into the Settlement Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo that included the right to distribute our Authorized Generic Acetadote injection product. Our branded Acetadote now competes with both the EDTA free Authorized Generic Acetadote distributed by Paddock and Perrigo along with generic Acetadote products that contain EDTA. 
Both Akorn and Aurobindo have received FDA approval for their generic form of the old Acetadote formulation containing EDTA and have launched their versions of that product.
Caldolor®
Caldolor is marketed for the treatment of pain and fever, primarily in a hospital setting. A variety of other products address the acute pain market:
17


• | Morphine, the most commonly used product for the treatment of acute, post-operative pain, is manufactured and distributed by several generic pharmaceutical companies;


• | Other generic injectable opioids, including fentanyl, meperidine and hydromorphone, address this market;


• | Ketorolac (brand name Toradol®), an injectable NSAID, is also manufactured and distributed by several generic pharmaceutical companies;


• | Ofirmev®, an injectable acetaminophen product is marketed by Mallinckrodt plc;


• | Exparel®, a bupivacaine delivery platform marketed by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and


• | Dyloject, an injectable diclofenac product by Pfizer Inc. approved by the FDA during 2015.

We are aware of other product candidates in development to treat acute pain including injectable NSAIDs, novel opioids, new formulations of existing therapies and extended release anesthetics. We believe non-narcotic analgesics for the treatment of post-surgical pain are the primary potential competitors to Caldolor.
In addition to the injectable analgesic products above, many companies are developing analgesics for specific indications such as migraine and neuropathic pain, oral extended-release forms of existing narcotic and non-narcotic products, and products with new methods of delivery such as transdermal. We are not aware of any approved injectable products indicated for the treatment of fever in the U.S. other than Caldolor and Ofirmev. There are, however, numerous drugs available to physicians to reduce fevers in hospital settings via oral administration to the patient, including ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and aspirin. These drugs are manufactured by numerous pharmaceutical companies.
Kristalose®
Kristalose is a dry powder crystalline prescription formulation of lactulose indicated for the treatment of constipation. The U.S. constipation therapy market includes various prescription and over the counter, or OTC, products. The prescription products which we believe are our primary competitors are:

• | Amitiza®, an oral product indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults, is marketed by Sucampo Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited;


• | MovantikTM, an oral product indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic non-cancer pain;


• | Linzess®, an oral product indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. It is marketed by Forest Laboratories, Inc. and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc; and


• | Liquid lactulose products are marketed by a number of pharmaceutical companies.

There are several hundred OTC products used to treat constipation marketed by numerous pharmaceutical and consumer health companies. MiraLax (polyethylene glycol 3350), previously a prescription product, was indicated for the treatment of constipation and manufactured and marketed by Braintree Laboratories, Inc. Under an agreement with Braintree, Schering-Plough introduced MiraLax as an OTC product in February 2007.
Omeclamox®-Pak
Omeclamox-Pak is a branded prescription product used for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and duodenal ulcer disease. It combines three well-known and widely prescribed medications packaged together for patient convenience: omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. The three individual components of Omeclamox-Pak are also available through three separate prescriptions. While there are several competitor products, Omeclamox-Pak is one of the few actively marketed products for this condition. In addition, compared to the branded competing products, Omeclamox-Pak has the lowest pill burden, fewest days of therapy and the lowest cost. The prescription combination products, indicated for treatment of H. pylori, which we believe are our primary competitors are:
18


• | PrevPac®, an oral product marketed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. There are also approved generic versions of PrevPac; 


• | Pylera®, an oral product marketed by Actavis Pharma, Inc. and Forest Laboratories, Inc.; and


• | Helidac®, an oral product marketed by Prometheus Therapeutics.

Vaprisol®
Vaprisol is a patented, prescription brand indicated to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The product was developed and registered by Astellas and then launched in 2006. It is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the first and only intravenously administered branded treatment. The other competing product is Samsca, an oral product marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company.
Ethyol®
Ethyol is a patented, prescription brand indicated to reduce xerostomia (dry mouth) as a side-effect in patients undergoing post-operative radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. We launched the product in late 2016, and the authorized generic form of the product was withdrawn by Clinigen who markets branded Ethyol internationally.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products. In the U.S., the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("FDCA"), the Public Health Service Act, and other federal statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to rigorous review. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or biologics license applications, ("BLAs"), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
We, our manufacturers and clinical research organizations may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act and import, export and customs regulations as well as the laws and regulations of other countries.
FDA Approval Process
The FDA is a regulatory agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. A key responsibility is to regulate the safety and effectiveness of drugs sold in the United States. The FDA divides that responsibility into two phases: pre-approval (premarket) and post approval (post market). The FDA reviews manufacturers' applications to market drugs in the United States; a drug may not be sold unless it has FDA approval. The agency continues its oversight of drug safety and effectiveness as long as the drug is on the market.
To market a prescription drug in the United States, a manufacturer needs FDA approval. To get that approval, the manufacturer must demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness according to criteria specified in law and agency regulations, ensure that its manufacturing plant passes FDA inspection, and obtain FDA approval for the drug's labeling, a term that includes all written material about the drug, including, for example, packaging, prescribing information for physicians, promotional materials and patient brochures.
The progression to drug approval begins before FDA involvement. First, basic scientists work in the laboratory and with animals; second, a drug or biotechnology company develops a prototype drug. That company must seek and receive FDA approval, by way of an IND application, to test the product with human subjects. Those tests, called clinical trials, are carried out sequentially in Phase I, II, and III studies, which involve increasing numbers of subjects. The manufacturer then compiles the resulting data and analysis in a NDA. The FDA reviews the NDA with three major concerns: (1) safety and effectiveness in the drug's proposed use; (2) appropriateness of the proposed labeling; and (3) adequacy of manufacturing methods to assure the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity.

The FDCA and associated regulations detail the requirements at each step. The FDA uses a few special mechanisms to expedite drug development and the review process when a drug might address an unmet need or a serious disease or condition. Those mechanisms include accelerated approval, animal efficacy approval, fast track applications, and priority review.
The sponsor of the drug typically conducts human clinical trials in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase I clinical trials are generally conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers, primarily to collect and assess pharmacokinetics and safety data at one or more dosages prior to proceeding into patients. In Phase II clinical trials, the sponsor evaluates the early efficacy of the product in short term trials on the targeted indication and identifies possible adverse effects and safety risks in a patient population. Phase III clinical trials typically involve testing for patients in long term trials examining safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically-dispersed test sites. 
The FDA requires that clinical trials be conducted in accordance with the FDA's GCP requirements. The FDA may order the partial, temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The institutional review board ("IRB"), or ethics committee (outside of the U.S.), of each clinical site generally must approve the clinical trial design and patient informed consent and may also require the clinical trial at that site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
The results of the nonclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for marketing approval. The NDA undergoes a 60-day validation review period before it is accepted for filing. If the NDA is found to be incomplete, it will not be accepted. Once the NDA is validated and accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA (currently PDUFA V - effective October 1, 2012), the FDA has 10 months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by two months to address deficiencies, or by three months if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review clock period. If the FDA's evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA will issue an approval letter. If not, a Complete Response letter will be sent informing applicants of changes that must be made before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding whether the application will ultimately be approved. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for the proposed indication(s) under study. The General Accounting Office ("GAO") reported that standard NDAs showed a steadier increase with the percentage of first-cycle approval letters rising from 43% for FY 2000 applications to 69% for FY 2010 applications. The percentage of priority NDAs receiving an approval letter at the end of the first review cycle fluctuated from FY 2000 through FY 2010, ranging between 47% and 80% during this time. The time and cost of completing these steps and obtaining FDA approval can vary dramatically depending on the drug. However, to complete these steps for a novel drug can take many years and cost millions of dollars.
Section 505(b) (2) New Drug Applications
An NDA may be submitted under different methods, a 505(b)(1), 505(b)(2) or 505(j). Section 505(b) provides for the submission of an NDA to support the approval of a drug. Upon approval, a drug may be marketed only for the FDA-approved indication(s) in the approved dosage form. Further clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for any additional indications or dosage forms. The FDA also requires post market safety surveillance reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug, which may result in withdrawal of approval after marketing begins. 
Section 505(b)(1) or the 'full' NDA is used for new chemical entities ("NCEs") and requires full clinical and nonclinical development of a compound. Marketing exclusivity assigned to a 505(b)(1) approval is five years. A 505(b)(2) NDA permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant using previously reported safety and efficacy data, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Generally new studies are required to provide data on the proposed change. Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs which have 
20

a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication or combination drugs. Marketing exclusivity for a 505(b)(2) submission is three years. Any marketing exclusivity is independent of patent exclusivity.
We successfully secured FDA approvals for Acetadote in January 2004 and for Caldolor in June 2009 pursuant to the 505(b)(2) pathway. 
Special protocol assessment process
The special protocol assessment, or SPA, process is designed to assess whether a planned protocol is adequate to meet scientific and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor. Three types of protocols related to PDUFA products are eligible for this special protocol assessment under the PDUFA goals: (1) animal carcinogenicity protocols, (2) final product stability protocols, and (3) clinical protocols for phase III trials whose data will form the primary basis for an efficacy claim if the trials had been the subject of discussion at an end-of-phase 2/pre-phase 3 meeting with the review division, or in some cases, if the division agrees to such a review because the division is aware of the developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed and the questions are being answered. The clinical protocols for phase III trials can relate to efficacy claims that will be part of an original NDA or BLA or that will be part of an efficacy supplement to an approved NDA or BLA.
New section 505(b)(4)(B) of the Modernization Act directs FDA to meet with sponsors, provided certain conditions are met, for the purpose of reaching agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in a marketing application submitted under section 505(b) of the Act or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).3. Such marketing applications include NDAs, BLAs, and efficacy supplements to approved NDAs and BLAs. Under new sections 505(b)(4)(B) and (C) of the Act, if a sponsor makes a reasonable written request to meet with the FDA for the purpose of reaching agreement on the design and size of a clinical trial, the FDA will meet with the sponsor. If an agreement is reached, the FDA will reduce the agreement to writing and make it part of the administrative record. An agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or FDA after the trial begins, except (1) with the written agreement of the sponsor and FDA, or (2) if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that "a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug" was identified after the testing began (section 505(b)(4)(C) of the Act). If a sponsor and the FDA meet regarding the design and size of a clinical trial under section 505(b)(4)(B) of the Act and the parties cannot agree that the trial design is adequate to meet the goals of the sponsor, the FDA will clearly state the reasons for the disagreement in a letter to the sponsor. However, the absence of an articulated disagreement on a particular issue should not be assumed to represent an agreement reached on that issue. Final determinations by the FDA with respect to a product candidate, including as to the scope of its “labeling”, are made after a complete review of the applicable NDA and are based on the entire data in the application.
On June 14, 2004, we submitted a request for SPA of our Caldolor Phase III clinical study. During a meeting with the FDA on September 29, 2004, the FDA confirmed that the efficacy data from our study of post-operative pain with a positive outcome was considered sufficient to support a 505(b)(2) application for the pain indication. 
Orphan drug designation
The Orphan Drug Act of 1983, ("Orphan Drug Act"), encourages manufacturers to seek approval of products intended to treat “rare diseases and conditions” with a prevalence of fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. or for which there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the development costs for the product. For products that receive orphan drug designation by the FDA, the Orphan Drug Act provides tax credits for clinical research, FDA assistance with protocol design, eligibility for FDA grants to fund clinical studies, waiver of the FDA application fee, and a period of seven years of marketing exclusivity for the product following FDA marketing approval. Acetadote received Orphan Drug designation in October 2001 and in 2004 the FDA approved the product to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen. Acetadote was entitled to marketing exclusivity until January 2011 for the treatment of this approved indication. 
Section 505(j) abbreviated new drug applications
An ANDA is a type of NDA where approval of a generic drug is based on demonstrating comparability to an innovator drug product (the RLD or Reference Listed Drug). Applications are "abbreviated" because they generally don't include preclinical and clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness. Generics must demonstrate that the 
21

product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in the same manner and is comparable to the 'innovator' product in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics and intended use). Abbreviated applications may be submitted for drug products that are the same as a listed drug and must be identical in active ingredient(s), form, strength, route of administration, and identical in conditions of use (non-exclusive uses). Products are declared suitable based on a suitability petition to the FDA. If the petition is approved, the Sponsor may then submit the ANDA.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, informally known as the "Hatch-Waxman Act", is a 1984 United States federal law which established the modern system of generic drugs. Hatch-Waxman amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Section 505(j) 21 U.S.C. 355(j) sets forth the process by which would-be marketers of generic drugs can file ANDAs to seek FDA approval of the generic. Section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV), the so-called Paragraph IV, allows 180-day exclusivity to companies that are the "first-to-file" an ANDA against holders of patents for branded counterparts.
Hatch-Waxman Amendments grant generic manufacturers the ability to mount a validity challenge without incurring the cost of entry or risking enormous damages flowing from any possible infringement. Hatch-Waxman essentially redistributes the relative risk assessments and explains the flow of settlement funds and their magnitude. Hatch-Waxman gives generics considerable leverage in patent litigation.
Health care legislation
On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or HCERA, was enacted into law, which modified the revenue provisions of the PPACA. The PPACA as amended by the HCERA constitutes the healthcare reform legislation. The following highlights certain provisions of the legislation that may affect us.
Pharmaceutical Industry Fee: Beginning in calendar-year 2011, an annual fee was imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs (e.g., Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs programs, Department of Defense programs and TRICARE). The annual fee is allocated to companies based on their previous calendar-year market share using sales data that the government agencies that purchase the pharmaceuticals will provide to the Treasury Department. Although we participate in governmental programs that subject us to this fee, our sales volume in such programs is less than $10 million, with the first $5 million of sales being exempt from the fee. This fee has not had a material impact and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations.
Physician Payments Sunshine Act: The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS for aggregation and subsequent public disclosure. Under the Sunshine Act, beginning August 1, 2013, we have collected data regarding reportable transfers of value and have reported such data to CMS. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. In addition to the Federal Sunshine Act, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. 
Medicaid Rebate Rate: We currently provide rebates for products sold to Medicaid beneficiaries. 
Product Serialization: In November of 2013, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) passed the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). The DSCSA was created to strengthen the security of the drug distribution supply chain by adding controls such as a national pharmaceutical track and trace system and establishing national standards for licensing of prescription drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers. DSCSA requires trading partners, including manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors and dispensers to provide transaction information to subsequent purchasers for certain prescription drugs. We have taken necessary steps to implement this program and will be in compliance with all requirements by the November 2017 deadline.

Post Approval Activities 
Once a drug is on the U.S. market (following FDA approval of the NDA), the FDA continues to address drug production, distribution, and use. FDA activities are based on ensuring drug safety and effectiveness, and address product integrity, labeling, reporting of research and adverse events, surveillance, drug studies, risk management, information dissemination, off-label use, and direct-to-consumer advertising. 
If we amend the NDA for an FDA approved product, such as adding safety or efficacy labeling claims, promoting those new claims, making certain manufacturing changes or product enhancements we will need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented. While physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. Securing FDA approval for new indications, product enhancements, and manufacturing and labeling changes may require us to conduct additional clinical trials under FDA's IND regulations. Even if such studies are conducted, they are still subject to the same requirements and timelines as an original NDA. 
The FDA continuously gathers information about possible adverse reactions to the products it has approved for use. The FDA requires all manufacturers to report adverse events. It also provides a procedure for consumers and physicians to voluntarily report their concerns about drugs. The agency collects those reports through MedWatch and uses its Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) to store and analyze them. Because some events may occur after the use of a drug for reasons unrelated to the product, the FDA reviews the events to assess which ones may indicate a problem with that particular drug. They then use information gleaned from the surveillance data to determine a course of action. They might recommend a change in drug labeling to alert users to a potential problem, or, perhaps, to require the manufacturer to study the observed association between the drug and the adverse event.
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed health care programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. 
Federal False Claims Act
The Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. A number of pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.
ICH - International Committee on Harmonization
Outside of the U.S., our ability to market our products will depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The International Committee on Harmonization (ICH) provides a set of standards that most Regulatory Authorities adhere to (e.g. U.S., Europe, and Japan) allowing greater harmonization in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for pharmaceutical product registration, thereby reducing or obviating duplication of testing carried out during the research and development of new human medicines. Regulatory harmonization offers many direct benefits to both regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry with beneficial impact for the protection of public health. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with such regulations. We anticipate that the effects of compliance with federal, state and local laws and 
23

regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment will not have any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
SEASONALITY
There are no significant seasonal aspects to our business.
BACKLOG
Due to the relatively short lead-time required to fill orders for our products, backlog of orders is not considered material to our business.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we had 82 full-time employees. We believe that our future will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel, including hospital and field sales personnel in particular.
