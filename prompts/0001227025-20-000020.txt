Overview
We develop, manufacture and sell optoelectronic products that transmit, receive and switch high-speed digital optical signals for Cloud and hyper-scale data center internet content provider and telecom networks. This is key to continuing to manage the explosive data traffic growth in Cloud and hyper-scale data centers. 
We specialize in products that operate at the highest speed over distance, for 100 Gigabits per Second ("G"), 200G, and 400G and beyond data rates, such as at 600G and 800G. Our products have the speed, size, low power consumption and interoperability to directly transmit data using industry standard Internet Protocol coding, or IP over DWDM wavelengths, greatly simplifying data networks. 
We are the world's primary supplier of tunable lasers that emit the ultra-pure light that is required for the highest speed over distance fiber optic communications links. 
We forward integrate our lasers and our high performance coherent optical components into transmit/receive modules, or transceivers. Our high speed transceiver modules, which can operate at 400G and above, drive down costs, extend reach and directly interconnect with switches and routers. 
We believe we are well positioned to achieve world market leadership in these laser, component and module products based on our leadership in the ultra-pure lasers which power them and our comprehensive capabilities in designing and producing the highest performance Silicon Photonics and Indium Phosphide devices based on our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration. 
We also believe that because of our laser and component technologies, we have been the first to deliver commercial mass production volumes for each of the highest speed advances in components since the advent of coherent optics for transmission ten years ago in 2010, as maximum speeds have advanced for each wavelength, or color, from 100G to 200G, 400G and now 800G. With adoption of coherent transmission using pluggable high speed optical modules in Cloud and hyper-scale data centers, we believe our total available market is rapidly expanding.
Our Industry Position
Our high-speed optical communications technologies encode information to optical signals from electronic signals for transmission and decode it for receiving. We achieve these ultra-high speeds with coherent technology that encodes phase, amplitude and polarization on an optical wavelength, packing in far more information than simple on/off encoding. We believe we are a global leader in coherent transmission technology, based on our achieved speeds, leadership in ultra-pure color lasers and optical integration for miniaturization and low power consumption.
Coherent is becoming the technology of choice for high speed data transmission in Cloud infrastructure and data center interconnection, in addition to telecom networks, where the highest speeds over distance were first developed. Moreover, we are the most significant producer of the pure light lasers that deliver data at the highest speeds, as we have delivered approximately 1.5 million lasers used by the approximately 2 million coherent ports deployed by the industry over the past 10 years (each port may use either one or two lasers).
Our High Speed Products for data rates of 100G, 200G and 400G were 91% of our 2019 revenues and were 86% of our 2018 revenues. Products capable of data rates of 400G and above have accounted for more than 10 percent of our revenue since 2018. Our sales concentration in High Speed Products has been increasing each year for more than 10 years. 
Our High Speed Products use our Silicon Photonics Integration and our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technologies, which optimize performance by combining different materials platforms so that the most appropriate material is used for each function. We believe that these technologies are an important competitive differentiator as they allow optimizing the cost and performance of our products. 
Narrow line width and low phase noise are essential for the lasers that power the highest speed modulations. As data rates increase over distance with advanced modulations, our ultra-pure light lasers are essential. The challenges of these highest data rates increasingly require the highest performance, the most compact and lowest power consumption components, and particularly the purest light lasers. 
We have grown our business by delivering the highest speed over distance for the Long Haul and Metro segments of the Telecom market. In recent years the Data Center Interconnect (DCI) market has become an increasing part of our revenue as the DCI market adopts high speed coherent optical technologies. 
Until recently our largest customers, Huawei Technologies, together with its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd. (collectively “Huawei”), and Ciena Corporation, have been suppliers of network equipment primarily focused on the Telecom market. Other leading customers include makers of telecom network equipment suppliers, such as Cisco, Nokia and ZTE.
As we look out over the next three years we expect Cloud and hyper-scale data center operators, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Tencent, could become significant customers as they increasingly link-up hyper-scale data centers regionally. These operators need the highest speeds at reaches up to 120 kilometers, defining a market sector where we excel and have fundamental technology advantages.
The Cloud and hyper-scale data center markets are adopting coherent technology to achieve lower cost per bit of data transmitted, lower power consumption and, as a result, scalability. We believe the Cloud and hyper-scale data center markets will become more important in our sales mix, we expect our typical annual revenue growth rate to benefit versus recent years, both from our further penetration of this market and from the higher growth rate of this market relative to Telecom.
Moreover, we believe that our laser technology will increase our share of coherent modules operating at the highest data rates of 400G and above that are critical to interconnect hyper-scale data centers.
The Emerging Information Age
 Rapid technology advances are allowing the digitizing of minute realms of knowledge, and of economic, social and information-focused life. Vast new areas of human activity are being virtualized with digital systems and with almost unimaginable amounts of data. This requires a massive infrastructure of hyper-scale data centers for processing and a massive network of optical interconnections. This infrastructure, i.e. the “Cloud”, is still in the early stages of transforming our way of life. 
There are more than 500 hyper-scale data centers around the world, each housing 100,000 or more micro-processors. Each hyper-scale data center is surrounded by many more enterprise level data centers. New applications requiring massive data manipulation are emerging continually, such as autonomous cars, virtual reality, smart homes, tele-medicine, genomics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. We believe such vast proliferation of data applications will continue to drive growth in hyper-scale and enterprise data centers for decades to come.
The ability to generate and process data requires that the data be transported to where it is needed. Thus, the second major element of the Cloud is the communications interconnections between data centers and consumers and between the data centers themselves.
 Today total annual IP data traffic will reach 4.8 Zettabytes by 2022, or 4.8 trillion billion bytes (which is roughly equivalent to 200 million times the data in the Library of Congress) according to the Cisco Visual Networking Index. Total data traffic is forecast to nearly double over the next three years, with nearly all of this data being carried over fiber optic data links. Optical communications is becoming the bottleneck in the growth of the Cloud. We have been a pioneer for new technology of “Coherent” communications powered by lasers and Photonic Integrated Circuits, or PICs, which are fueling this continued expansion while transforming telecommunications.
Networks operating at 400G and beyond data rates have adopted coherent transmission technology because of its ability to increase data rates and lower costs. These high speed networks are among the highest growth segments of the optical communications market, and support the rapid expansion of telecom backbone, hyper-scale data center and content provider networks, accommodating increased mobile traffic. 
We expect growth in the 400G and beyond segment to be driven primarily by increased adoption of our high speed products in the much larger Cloud infrastructure market, the Metro market sector and in the high speed data center interconnect, or DCI, market. 
Distance Matters in Communications Networks
It is more challenging and expensive to transmit a signal several thousand kilometers across a continent than it is to send the same information a few hundred meters across a data center or campus network. 
Specific technologies have been developed for communications inside the data center and between data centers themselves as well as between data centers and consumers. We believe our solutions are often unique in their ability to provide high integrity signals across longer distances. But with advances in our silicon photonics technology and hybrid photonic integration technology, used in conjunction with advanced modulation and digital signal processing, the costs of high speed coherent transmission are becoming more competitive at shorter reaches including distances of 80 kilometers, 40 kilometers and approaching 10 kilometers. These shorter reaches include applications where interconnect volumes are much larger, and where we historically have not sold our products directly. Thereby shorter reaches offer us further major growth opportunities.
For distances of 80 kilometers to 2000 kilometers, or from ZR reaches to long haul, very different technologies are needed. The benefits of coherent transmission have made it the preferred technology for these state-of-the-art high speed networks, and we believe that our Silicon Photonics Integration and Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technologies effectively address the challenges inherent in precision and high volume manufacturing of optical components for coherent transmission at these longer distances.
Emerging Change in Network Architecture
We believe the changes at 400G and above data rates portend a coming significant change in high speed network architectures to more efficiently implement the 400G and above technologies provided by us. Today, a data center or central office equipment rack contains complex circuit boards or line cards or so-called “pizza boxes”, usually supplied by a separate network equipment manufacturer, or NEM, to provide the fiber optic link. However, this results in a complex and costly architecture. 
We believe our coherent techniques and PICs will enable this forecasted significant change in network architecture. These technologies make it possible for long distance transmission by pluggable transceiver modules that connect directly into switches and routers inside data centers that have thus far been used only for short reach connections within data centers. Such dis-aggregated Open Line Systems can manage optical signals between data centers, sometimes called “IP over DWDM”, with all needed channel management, amplification, traffic planning and monitoring functions. Connections between data centers then become as simple as connections within data centers - a breakthrough benefit to the network operator.

To illustrate, a 400 Gigabit connection between two routers in different data centers 80 kilometers apart can made by plugging our new 400ZR OSFP pluggable transceiver into each router and connecting the fibers through an “Open Line System” DWDM wavelength multiplexer, also made by us. Similarly a distance of 400 kilometers or more can be accommodated using our new 400ZR+ modules.
New Architecture Supported by 400ZR Interconnects
This new architecture eliminates two complex network equipment boxes and four short reach data center transceivers and consequently reduces the cost per bit of the optical link by as much as 80 percent. The architecture is possible because coherent technology, driven by ultra-pure lasers and coupled with our highly integrated photonic chips, packages the long distance transmission capability of the NEM line card into a small form factor pluggable transceiver that is plug-compatible with standard short reach data center transceivers and with acceptable power consumption. For example, a NeoPhotonics 400ZR OSFP or QSFP-DD capable of 80 kilometer transmission plugs into the same slot on a router that also accommodates a 400G DR4 OSFP or QSFP-DD data center transceiver capable of only 500 meters transmission. 
We believe that over the next few years, this connection architecture will become the mainstay of new installations, moving a significant portion of the capital expenditures from network equipment supplied DWDM proprietary boxes to 
disaggregated direct 400ZR interconnections. This new approach of IP over DWDM moves Internet Protocol traffic from switches and routers directly over an Open Line system DWDM channel without passing through a proprietary network equipment transmission box. 
Our Solutions
Three critical optical components are required to make a coherent transceiver: (1) a laser with a very narrow linewidth for very pure light; (2) a coherent modulator capable of changing both the intensity and phase of the optical signal to code data onto it; and (3) a coherent receiver capable of detecting both the intensity and phase of the received optical signal to “interpret” its content, plus an electronic digital signal processor IC (DSP). 
We have been a leading volume supplier of these optical components since coherent systems were first deployed in volume for telecommunications networks a decade ago, in 2010. We are now the leading supplier of narrow linewidth tunable lasers and coherent receivers to the coherent market, and we have introduced new high speed coherent modulators for 400G, 600G and above applications. 
We believe our Silicon Photonics and our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technologies are well positioned to serve the highest speed next-generation 200G, 400G, 600G and 800G and beyond products and applications. Using these core technologies we produce photonic integrated circuits, or PICs, that comprise both arrayed and individual photonic functional elements using optimized materials systems and processes from Silicon Photonics, Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide and Silicon Germanium. These individual PICs are combined using our hybrid integration technology to make complete products, such as our Coherent Optical Sub-assembly (“COSA”), our Integrated Coherent Receiver (“ICR”) and our Coherent Driver-Modulator (“CDM”), and our ultra-narrow linewidth (“NLW”) tunable laser for 400G and beyond coherent transport, Metro and DCI applications. Moreover, high performance optics and ultra-pure lasers reduce the need in some systems for DSP algorithms to correct less pure optical signals, thereby improving performance, cost and power consumption. 
In parallel, commercial DSP development has followed Moore’s Law to achieve the performance and low power necessary for 400ZR and 400ZR+ coherent modules. The latest generation of DSPs incorporate forward error correction software recently standardized by the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) so that they can interoperate with each other. This means that the data traffic can remain in IP format and be directly communicated between switches and routers without passing through a proprietary network equipment box, thereby accelerating IP over DWDM. We combine our unique high performance coherent COSA and Narrow Linewidth Laser with a commercially available DSP to manufacture 400ZR modules, including 400G CFP2, OSFP and DD-QSFP digital coherent optical (“DCO”) transceivers for Cloud, data center interconnect and telecom wireline and wireless networks.
We have pioneered developing and commercializing Silicon Photonics products for fiber communications, beginning with Silica on Silicon passive products and progressing into Silicon on Insulator active products. We have demonstrated Silicon Photonics coherent modulators operating at 600G per wavelength and with active product development for Silicon Photonics coherent modulators for 800G and above. We combine all of the optics necessary for DCI and Metro coherent transmission in compact packages that fit inside standard data center transponder form factors, such as our 400G OSFP and QSFP-DD transceiver modules. 
We further combine coherent transmission technologies to maximize interconnect bandwidth capacity. For example, our new C++ LASERTM ITLA, C++ CDMTM Modulator and C++ ICRTM Receiver are uniquely capable of increasing fiber capacity up to 50 percent and to deliver up to 32 Tbits bits of capacity over a single fiber. This approach leverages our 75- to 100GHz-spaced PLC multiplexers for Open Line Systems. We believe that these unique solutions will continue to provide lower cost-per-bit for Cloud and hyper scale applications as well as for 5G and telecom networks.
The capabilities of coherent optics continue to grow with increasing photonic integration for higher performance and smaller size, and open further opportunities for us in adjacent markets. Outside of communications, coherent technology improves sensitivity and performance for a variety of applications including inter-satellite communication links including for low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, plus industrial applications, 3D sensing for autonomous vehicle navigation, and medical imaging. 
Our Core Technologies in Silicon Photonics and Hybrid Photonic Integration 
We believe we have all the capabilities required for producing the highest performance Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integrated optoelectronic and silicon photonics devices for the highest speed and most stringent performance requirements. Our core technologies are a unique multi-material platform that includes:
Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration is our core technology and drives our ability to design, develop and produce industry leading, unique and differentiated high speed optoelectronics products. We utilize a set of proprietary integration platforms that provide optoelectronic functionality on Silicon and other integrated compound semiconductor substrates including Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide and Silicon Germanium. Complete advanced photonics integration capability requires integrated combinations of these platforms to achieve optimal performance and cost. The integration of more than one material substrate is called hybrid integration, and our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration is used in our 100G and beyond products. 
Silicon Photonics Integration and Active Silicon: Silicon is efficient for electronics and versatile for integration, while being very inefficient in generating or detecting light in the telecom wavelength window. Consequently, Silicon Photonics integrated circuits must be designed to be easily integrated with lasers fabricated from Indium Phosphide, detectors based on germanium doped silicon, or other functions and materials through Hybrid Photonic Integration. We design Silicon Photonics modulators, receivers, coherent optical subassemblies and laser subassemblies and fabricate the Silicon wafers in commercial Silicon foundries. We co-packages these Silicon Photonics chips with lasers made from Indium Phosphide to form Active Silicon elements.
Indium Phosphide (InP): Indium Phosphide is used to produce efficient lasers, sensitive photodetectors and modulators in the wavelength window typically used for telecommunications. As a compound semiconductor bandgap material, InP is the most important material for the generation of laser signals and the detection and conversion of those signals back to electronic form. We design and manufacture laser and detector chips in our own Indium Phosphide fabs and integrate them with silicon photonics circuits using Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration. InP-based modulators and detectors are also used for demanding applications such as long-haul and undersea systems.
Silicon Planar Lightwave Circuits: Silicon is a multi-attribute material and waveguides of Silicon or doped Silicon Dioxide (silica) have very low optical loss and are ideal for switching, filtering or interferometric applications. We design and manufacture doped silica photonic chips in our own fabs and integrate them with other photonic circuits using Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration.
Gallium Arsenide (GaAs): Gallium Arsenide operates at very high speeds due to its high electron mobility and is used to make analog integrated circuit drivers for high speed lasers and modulators. We design and manufacture GaAs ICs in our own fab for integrate them with our lasers and modulators.
Silicon Germanium (SiGe): Silicon Germanium is used to manufacture mixed signal and analog integrated circuits for high speed driver and trans-impedance amplifiers used in 100G and beyond systems. We make SiGe devices using standard silicon processing techniques in commercial foundries.
Laser Technologies: We specialize in the design, manufacture and control of lasers. Our principle products include ultra-narrow linewidth tunable lasers, electro-absorptively modulated lasers (EMLs) and distributed feedback lasers (DFB). We design and fabricate laser chips in our fabs and we integrated them with our control circuitry.
This ability to combine specific functional elements out of optimized materials results in very compact and low power consumption components.
Optoelectronic engineering and integration. As we create complex integrated optoelectronic devices, we design and build electronic control algorithms and devices, signal processing methodologies, hardware and software routines and protocols, and device level ASICs that function to control and manage the highest performance features and capabilities of these integrated optoelectronic devices and systems. For example, our coherent modules are well characterized and controlled to deliver the full operating range and performance of our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration platform.
Hardware and firmware integration. We also sell our products as modules and subsystems which contain electronic hardware and firmware controls that interface directly with our customers’ systems. We design the electronic hardware and develop the firmware for control of our optical products and subsystems.
Devices, Components, Modules and Subsystems. We design and manufacture modules and subsystems that combine our products with other elements to offer customers a complete solution. We sell products at each level of product utility and can achieve the highest performance and capture the greatest value. We utilize contract manufacturers for assembly operations where it is efficient to do so.

Our Products
Our ultra-narrow linewidth tunable lasers are core to our coherent communications strategy, and our other coherent components and modules provide industry leading performance and are forward integrations of our lasers.
We produce transmitter and receiver components and modules, as well as switching products, for 100G and beyond transmission over distances of 2 to 2,000 kilometers. We integrate transmitter and receiver components into next generation pluggable transceiver modules. 
All of our high speed 100G and beyond products are based on our Silicon Photonics technology or our Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technology. These technologies support encoding 400 Gigabits or more per second of information for transmitting over a single channel and decoding the information at the receiver, and enable smaller, more compact and more highly integrated designs for the individual elements and integrated COSAs.
 Coherent transmission can only be accomplished in practice using advanced photonic integration to intimately couple functional elements. Coherent systems manipulate light to encode ten times to forty times or more the amount of information on the same wavelength channel than is possible with traditional methods. 
Our Coherent Products include Ultra-Narrow Linewidth Tunable Lasers (NLW-TL), which generate the ultra-pure wavelength, or color, necessary for coherent transmission; coherent modulators which encode the electronic information based on the polarization, phase and amplitude of the optical beam; and Integrated Coherent Receivers (ICRs), which decode the phase and polarization of the encoded coherent optical signal. 
Our coherent optoelectronic modules, which integrate our components, provide complete transmit and receive functions including variable modulation capability to adjust data rates. Compact integration of our “transceiver” modules allows them to be pluggable and to reduce costs by replacing traditional much larger and more complex boxes. 
We sell our components separately to network equipment manufacturers in addition to using them in our own modules. We expect to sell our modules to Cloud and hyper-scale data center operators and to network equipment manufacturers.
Each of our module products incorporates one each of our component lasers, integrated coherent receivers and modulators. Further, to minimize size, we often integrate the receiver and modulator into a single component, a coherent optical subassembly, or COSA. In addition, each transceiver module has a digital signal processor (DSP) as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). These four elements, three components and the DSP, comprise most of the bill of materials for a module, and are roughly comparable in value.
Elements of a Coherent Transceiver DCO Module
We believe we are the primary world supplier of ultra-narrow linewidth lasers that are essential for the highest speed modules and components in coherent communications.
We develop and manufacture Transmitter Products, Receiver Products and Switch Products that are used in ultra-high speed digital optical communications, high speed switching and provisioning. We combine our transmitter and receiver products into Transceiver modules. Our Switching Products, such as Multi-Cast Switches, are used primarily in ROADM nodes that dynamically and efficiently allocate bandwidth to adjust for fast changing traffic patterns and for provisioning software defined optical networks. Our products can be categorized into groups, including High Speed Products for 100G, 400G, 600G, 800G and beyond applications, including in coherent networks, and Network Products and Solutions, for lower speed networks and other telecom wavelength management and instrumentation products.
Our Coherent Module Products
400G Pluggable Coherent Transceivers: We produce industry leading pluggable coherent transceivers operating at speeds from 100G to 400G. We have introduced new pluggable coherent modules which combine our ultra-narrow linewidth laser with our coherent receiver and with our high performance coherent modulator or integrated COSA.  
Our 400ZR OSFP and our new QSFP-DD transceivers both provide 400G connections over a DCI reach of up to 125 kilometer in a standard client side pluggable form factor. These modules support OIF standard error correction software and can interoperate with other transceivers using the same standardized software, enabling direct IP over DWDM.
Our 400G capable CFP2-DCO transceiver is the industry’s first transceiver module that can deliver as much as 32 Terabits of capacity per fiber. Our internal optics support 85 channels of 64 Gbaud data at 75 GHz wavelength channel spacing. This CFP2-DCO modules supports long haul, metro and DCI network applications. Our 100G CFP provides metro reach connections in a standard CFP form factor.
Our Laser Products 
Ultra-Narrow Linewidth Tunable Laser Products: We produce industry leading tunable laser products based on an external cavity design (ECL). Due to their longer cavity length, ECLs generate a much purer “color,” or narrower “linewidth,” which is critical with new higher order modulation techniques and higher baud rates, and thereby carry significantly more information. In addition to a standard Micro-ITLA form factor, we also offer a Nano-ITLA that achieves comparable ultra-narrow linewidth, low frequency phase noise and the low power consumption in a compact package approximately one half the size of our standard Micro-ITLA. 
Further extending our world leadership in lasers for the highest speed and highest capacity communications links, we also provide ultra-narrow line width lasers with wider tuning ranges which support more channels or higher speeds. For high baud rate, high capacity per wavelength systems, the Micro Ultra-Narrow Linewidth Tunable lasers are available in a C++ LASERTM configuration, which has a tuning range of 6 THz, covering the full “Super C-band.” This is 50 percent more spectrum than a standard 80 channel, 50 GHz spaced laser. The C++ LASERTM ITLA can tune over 120 channels with 50 GHz per channel spacing or 80 channels with 75 GHz per channel spacing. For example, this fully captures the increase in fiber capacity 
generated by these newer modulation approaches when combined with our C++ ICRTM Receivers and C++ CDMTM Modulators,
High Performance Laser Products: For applications inside data centers and in connecting antennas for 5G wireless networks, we also design and manufacture electro-absorptively modulated lasers (EML) and high power distributed feedback lasers (DFB) as well as driver ICs for these lasers.
We manufacture and sell 100G products for data center applications, including 28 Gbaud EMLs, laser drivers, modulator drivers and photodiode receivers. 
We are developing ultra-high-speed 53 Gbaud EML lasers and laser driver for single wavelength PAM4 100G applications and subsequently four wavelength 400G intra-data center transmission.
For hyper-scale data center applications, we have introduced high power laser diode array products for short reach Silicon Photonics based 100G intra-data center interconnections which use parallel single-mode architectures, or PSM4, as well as coarse wavelength division multiplexing, or CWDM architectures. 
Our Coherent Component Products
High Speed Products: We produce transmitter and receiver products for 100G and beyond optical transmission applications over distances of up to 2,000 kilometers. These products include our integrated coherent receiver (ICR) and coherent driver modulator (CDM), which also support baud rates of up to 96 Gbaud and can operate over the C++ wavelength band covering 6 THz. We have integrated transmitter and receiver functions into a single integrated component called a COSA (Coherent Optical Sub Assembly), which has an ultra-small form factor designed to fit into the next generation pluggable transceivers such as OSFP and QSFP-DD. Our technologies support encoding 100 to 800 Gigabits or more per second of information for transmitting over a single channel and decoding the information at the receiver, as well as enabling smaller, more compact and more highly integrated designs for the individual elements and integrated COSAs.
Our Wavelength Management Products
We develop and manufacture wavelength management products that are used in ultra-high speed digital optical communications, high speed switching and provisioning. Our Switching Products, Multi-Cast Switches, are used primarily in ROADM nodes to allocate bandwidth dynamically and efficiently, adjusting for fast changing traffic patterns and provisioning and supporting software defined optical networks. 
Multi-cast Switch Modules: We provide a proprietary switching solutions for 100G and above coherent systems embodied in our Multi-Cast Switch (MCS) product line. Our 4x16, 8x16 and 12x16 modules for CDC ROADMs efficiently allocate bandwidth and route signals in 100G and higher data rate coherent networks. The Multi-Cast Switch provides scalable contentionless operation to achieve the highest traffic management efficiency, optimizing traffic flows in coherent transmission systems. Our MCS uses our PLC photonic integration platform and consists of a complex array of switches, waveguides, taps, crossings and other functional elements manufactured on Silicon wafers using standard semiconductor processing equipment. Our PLC technology exhibits very low loss and extends the Multi-Cast Switch to higher port count.
Network Products and Solutions: We design and manufacture other wavelength management products including arrayed wavelength gratings (AWGs), multiplexers and filters used in Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems. NeoPhotonics is a leading integrated manufacturer of AWGs and has shipped more than half a million AWGs to the market world-wide. 
We design and manufacture wavelength management products for high capacity coherent systems operating at 800G or higher. We have introduced new AWGs for advanced coherent systems that offer channel spacing from 75 GHz to 150 GHz and channel counts from 40 to 85 channels, covering the 6 THz C++ band, supporting new coherent systems operating in the range from 60 to 128 Gbaud.
Our Infrastructure, Intellectual Properties and Our Employees
We have product development and product sustaining engineering teams in Silicon Valley (San Jose and Fremont, California), Ottawa, Canada, Tokyo, Japan and Shenzhen and Wuhan, China. In our Silicon Valley and Tokyo facilities we conduct research, product development and product roadmap definitions, including for our Silicon Photonics and Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration PIC products. In our Shenzhen facilities, we conduct new product development, manufacturing and process engineering, quality control, continuous improvement and cost reduction relating to product manufacturing, assembly and test. In our Wuhan, China and Ottawa, Canada facilities we conduct new device, component and product development.
We seek to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights and trade secret laws in each of the locations in which we do business. We have filed applications for patents to protect certain of our intellectual property in the U.S. and in other countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, China, Russia, India, Taiwan and several European Union countries. As of December 31, 2019 we had approximately 496 issued patents, expiring between 2020 and 2038 covering various aspects of our technologies.
We have manufacturing operations in the U.S., Japan, China and Thailand. Our wafer fabrication operations are located in our San Jose and Fremont, California facilities, as well as in our Japan facilities, and include chip design, clean room fabrication, integration and related facilities for chip-level devices and PICs. Our manufacturing, assembly and test operations are located in our Shenzhen and Dongguan, China facilities, in Thailand and in Silicon Valley, California. 
As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,690 employees and non-employee contractors, of which 261 were based in the U.S., 1,268 in China, 144 in Japan and 17 in the rest of the world.
None of our U.S. or Canadian employees are represented by a labor union. Chinese law allows that all employees be members of a union that is overseen by the Chinese government. The majority of the employees in our Japanese subsidiary are also members of a union. We have not experienced employment-related work stoppages and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Our Customers
In 2019, 2018 and 2017, our five largest customers accounted for 84%, 87% and 78% of our total revenue, respectively. In 2019, customers of 10% or more revenue were Huawei Technologies, together with its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd. (collectively “Huawei”), and Ciena Corporation, which accounted for 41% and 29% of our total revenue, respectively. In 2018, customers of 10% or more revenue were Huawei and Ciena, which accounted for 46% and 24% of our total revenue, respectively. In 2017, Huawei and Ciena accounted for 40% and 16% of our total revenue, respectively.
On May 16, 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") added Huawei and certain affiliates to the BIS Entity List ("Entity List"), with an effective date of May 21, 2019. This denies Huawei the ability to purchase products, software and technology that are subject to U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR). As Huawei has been our largest customer in recent quarters, this had a material impact on the revenue and profitability we had forecasted prior to the BIS action. As a result, we have adjusted capital expenditures, operating expenditures, project plans and incoming materials for changing demand levels to mitigate risks associated with the Entity List and intend to continue to manage with such actions in place while the denial remains in place.
Our Sales and Marketing
We operate a sales model that focuses on alignment with our customers through coordination of our sales, product application engineering and manufacturing teams. Our sales cycles typically require a significant amount of time and a substantial expenditure of resources before we can realize revenue from the sale of products. The length of our sales cycle, from initial request to design win, is typically 6 to 12 months for an existing product and 12 to 18 months or longer for a new product.
We use a global direct sales force based in North America, Europe and Asia, including China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. These individuals work with our product application engineers, and product marketing and sales operations teams, in an integrated approach to address our customers’ current and future needs. We have very deep technical relationships. We believe that these collaborative engineering activities provide us insight into our customers’ broader and longer-term needs. We view our technical sales capability and our technical relationships with customers are important parts of our value delivery to our strategic customers.
Our marketing team focuses on product strategy, product development, roadmap development, new product introduction processes, program management, product demand stimulation and assessment, and competitive analysis. Our marketing team also seeks to educate the market about our products by communicating our value proposition and product differentiation in direct customer interactions and presentations and at industry tradeshows and at technical conferences. It is important that these teams are engaged in both industry forums such as MSA (multi supplier agreement) Committees, as well as direct customer and end-user engagements.
Our Research and Development
We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital into our research and development operations. Our research and development activities continue to push the performance leadership boundaries in high speed digital optics, silicon photonics and hybrid photonic integration, optoelectronics control and in signal processing.
Research and development expenses were $57.6 million, $53.8 million and $58.3 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We have research and development and wafer fabrication facilities in San Jose and Fremont, California and in Tokyo, Japan that coordinate with our research and development and manufacturing facilities in Dongguan, Shenzhen and Wuhan, China and Ottawa, Canada. We use proprietary design tools and design-for-manufacturing techniques to align our design process with our precision nanoscale, vertically integrated manufacturing and testing. We believe we are one of the highest volume manufacturers of PICs in the world and that we can further expand our manufacturing capacity to meet market needs.
Our Suppliers
We use suppliers from the U.S., China, Japan and other locations. Although there are multiple sources for most of the component parts of our products, some components are sourced from single or, in some cases, limited sources, which can increase risks of materials availability for production. We typically do not have written agreements with the majority of these component manufacturers to guarantee the supply of the components used in our products. We also use contract manufacturers in Thailand, China, Japan and other Asia locations for the back-end manufacturing of certain of our products.
As a supply philosophy we generally maintain long term relationships with leading suppliers who can meet our stringent technical requirements at the same time as being cost competitive. We believe that as the industry scales the entire supply chain is working to scale. As a result, we work closely with our suppliers to understand their business as we grow together.  This requires our continuing close management.
We also work to develop new companies as suppliers for new technologies, innovations and for purposes of managing costs over time. We examine our supply chain for their performance, quality, technology and technology roadmaps, service, engineering talent, labor practices and environmental sustainability.
We promote long term relationships with suppliers that we believe have the elements for long term success and managements that exercise good practices for both their long term success and our long term success and competitiveness.
Our Backlog
Sales of our products generally are made pursuant to purchase orders, often with short lead times. These purchase orders are typically made without deposits and may be subject to revision or cancellation. The quantities actually purchased by our customers, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised to reflect changes in our customers’ needs and in our supply of products.
Certain of our customers use vendor managed inventory (VMI) arrangements under which we manufacture at a customer’s request, then ship to its facility or a designated contract manufacturer for the customer, to be held until it is used by the customer. We maintain title to vendor managed inventory until the customer uses the inventory. At that time the customer takes title to the products, it reports the consumption to us and we recognize the revenue for the product sale. 
Our direct sales force works our customers in an integrated approach to understand current and future needs. Because we operate a sales model that focuses on alignment with our customers there is the possibility of changes in delivery or acceptance schedules, cancellations, modifications or price reductions with limited or no penalties.
BIS added Huawei and certain affiliates to the Entity List with an effective date of May 21, 2019. As Huawei has been the Company’s largest customer in recent quarters, this has a material impact on the forecasted revenue and profitability for the Company. As a result, the Company ceased using VMI arrangements with Huawei to mitigate risks associated with the Entity 
List. As a result, most of our business today is conducted with direct purchase orders instead of operating through VMI as in the past.
We are committed to EAR compliance in each of the locations in which we do business. We determined that certain of our products are not subject to EAR regulations and may be lawfully sold to Huawei. During 2018, non-EAR products were over half of our Huawei revenue and shipments to Huawei of many of these products continue. Further, we have applied for licenses for certain technology subject to EAR, and at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have been granted a license to ship limited (not material) volumes of US-manufactured lasers to Huawei.
Seasonality
Historically, our first quarter revenue is generally seasonally lower than the rest of the year primarily due to lower capacity utilization during the annual new-year holidays in China and the impact of typical price negotiations conducted at the end of each calendar year and impacting shipments during this period. This historical pattern is important in recognizing the typical annual distribution of revenue from quarter to quarter through the year. That said, our first quarter revenue varies markedly year to year so should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance.
As a business practice we seek longer term agreements with customers, especially for projects and for larger international tenders, whenever possible. We actively bridge product and backlog to manage the seasonality against our production cycles, and we carefully work to match and balance end user demand with direct customer demand.
Customer Inventory
The business cycle, as well as international trade discussion between countries including US and China, require that we carefully monitor and adjust product levels in line with end user demand to minimize impacts of inventory overstocking by direct customers. To mitigate risks of excess inventory we seek to align our product volumes with that of end users by conducting end user surveys each quarter. We have placed increased focus on managing inventory levels in light of the BIS actions regarding Huawei, as demand from Huawei has remained strong for product not subject to the EAR restrictions.
Financial Information by Geographic Region
Our leading customers use contract manufacturers for much of their manufacturing needs. Such major contract manufacturers are in Mexico, China, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. These are our “ship to” destinations. We have historically reported quarterly revenue by geographic territory, i.e. Americas, China, and Rest of World. The use of contract manufacturers by our customers means that our geographic sales do not represent end-use locations by either our customers or by their respective customers.
For information regarding our revenue and property, plant and equipment by geographic region, see Note 3 and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For risks relating to our operations see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and particularly the risks under the caption “Risks related to our operations in China” and the risk factors “Our future results of operations may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and Japanese Yen (JPY) exchange rates”, “Risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and financial results.”, and “We are dependent on Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and its affiliate HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd. and on four other customers for a large portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders in any period from any of these major customers may reduce our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations.”
Competition
The market for optical communications systems is highly competitive. While no single company competes with us across all of our product areas, our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. We believe the principal competitive factors in this market are:

• | ability to provide leading edge technologies for high speed communications, including ultra-narrow linewidth lasers;


• | ability to design and manufacture high quality, reliable products, including customized solutions;


• | breadth of product solutions;


• | price to performance characteristics;


• | ability to quickly and consistently produce in high volume and high quality;


• | ability to meet customers’ specific requirements including technology requirements;


• | ability to meet customer lead time demands;


• | financial stability; and


• | depth of relationships with and proximity to customers globally.

We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We believe our principal competitors include:

• | Acacia Communications, Inc., Furukawa Co., Ltd., Fujitsu Optical Components Limited, NTT Electronics Corporation, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd ("SEI"), II-VI Incorporated, Lumentum Holdings Inc. (formerly JDS Uniphase Corporation), and others in lasers and coherent products;


• | Accelink Technologies Co., Ltd., Lumentum. II-VI, Molex Incorporated and NTT Electronics Corporation in wavelength management and switching.

Our competitors may have substantially greater name recognition and technical, financial and marketing resources than we do. Some of our competitors have greater resources to develop products or pursue acquisitions, and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for these products and technologies than we do. In addition, a number of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at below market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively and which could adversely affect our financial performance.
We also face competition from some of our customers, including Huawei and Ciena, who evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally. These customers may have the ability to manufacture competitive products at a lower cost than we would charge as a result of their higher levels of integration. As a result, these customers may purchase less of our products and there would be additional pressure to lower our selling prices which, accordingly, would negatively impact our revenue and gross margin.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our research and development and manufacturing operations and our products are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations govern, among other things, the discharge of pollutants to air, water, and soil; the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination; the use, handling and disposal of hazardous materials; employee health and safety; and the hazardous material content and recycling of our products. We use, store and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations and as components in our products. We incur costs to comply with existing environmental, health and safety requirements, and any failure to comply, or the identification of contamination for which we are found liable, could cause us to incur additional costs, including cleanup costs, monetary fines, or civil or criminal penalties, or result in the curtailment of our operations. 
We concertedly comply with all regulations in each place in which we do business. In addition, we concern ourselves and our supply chain with environmental sustainability. Environmental, health and safety requirements have become more stringent over time, and changes to existing requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment, or cause us to incur other significant expenses or to modify our manufacturing processes or the contents of our products. Some jurisdictions in which we operate or sell our products have enacted requirements regarding the recycling of waste electronic equipment, and/or the packaging and hazardous material content of certain products. For example, jurisdictions including China and the European Union, among a growing number of jurisdictions, have placed restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products, which affects the composition and packaging of our products. The passage of such requirements in additional jurisdictions, or the tightening of standards or elimination of certain exemptions in jurisdictions where our products are already subject to such requirements, could cause us to incur significant expenditures to make our products compliant with new requirements, or could limit the markets into which we may sell our products.
Operating facilities and procedures support local initiatives for clean water, for factory emissions and for other sensitive materials and compliance needs including conflict minerals and management of waste streams. We are fully compliant with current RoHS requirements and we similarly pursue best practices in our owned factories and with our subcontractor manufacturing partners.
Additionally, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHG, may also impact us. For example, our semiconductor manufacturing operations in California use perfluorocarbons, which are classified as a high global warming potential greenhouse gas. Under California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, we designed and installed additional pollution control equipment at our San Jose, California, manufacturing plant to reduce our perfluorocarbon emissions beginning in 2012. Since the end of 2012 our San Jose and Fremont, California, manufacturing facilities have maintained compliance with the Global Warming Solutions Act through the monitoring and reviewing of our Greenhouse Gas Emissions including permits issued locally by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, and we have submitted reports annually to verify such compliance. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a finding relating to GHG emissions that may result in promulgation of federal GHG air quality standards that could also affect us.
