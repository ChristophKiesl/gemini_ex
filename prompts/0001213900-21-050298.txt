VIE Agreements


Information relating to our corporate history is incorporated by reference from our 2020 Annual Report under the caption “VIE Agreements.” 
 
We rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated VIE and its shareholders, Zhixin Liu, Chairman of the Board, President, CEO of the Company and Corporate Secretary, and Fu Liu, a Director of the Company (Fu Liu is the father of Zhixin Liu), to operate our business. Our affiliation with Shuhai Beijing is managed through the VIE Agreements, which agreements may not be as effective in providing us with control over Shuhai Beijing as direct ownership. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over our consolidated VIE. If our consolidated VIE or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, our recourse to the assets held by our consolidated VIE is indirect and we may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources to enforce such arrangements in reliance on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may not always be effective, particularly in light of uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Furthermore, in connection with litigation, arbitration or other judicial or dispute resolution proceedings, assets under the name of any of record holder of equity interest in our consolidated VIE, including such equity interest, may be put under court custody. As a consequence, we cannot be certain that the equity interest will be disposed pursuant to the contractual arrangement or ownership by the record holder of the equity interest.
 
All of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the U.S. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant time delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, it would be very difficult to exert effective control over our consolidated VIE, and our ability to conduct our business and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Government Regulation; Licenses

Our operations are subject to and affected by PRC laws and regulations. The primary governmental regulation regulating the Internet security equipment industry in the PRC is the Cybersecurity Law, which governs entities providing “critical information infrastructure.” This statute provides basic protections for Internet users, such as not selling individual’s data to other companies without the user’s permission and not knowingly distributing malware. This law at present is only in draft form, but is expected to be adopted in the near future. Our wholly owned subsidiaries and our VIE and its subsidiaries are required to have, and each has, a business license issued by the PRC State Administration for Market Regulation and its local counterparts. In addition, major PRC regulations applicable to our products and services and the Internet security industry include Computer Information System Security Specific Product Testing and Sales License Management Method (Ministry of Public Security Order No. 32) (“Order 32”) and Internet Security Protection Technology Measures Provision (Ministry of Public Security Order No. 82) (“Order 82”). Order 32 sets forth the license requirement for Internet security products providers and related approval procedures of license applications. Order 82 specifies certain security measures Internet service providers shall take to ensure Internet security. Providers of ISP connecting service and Internet-based data processing service are within the scope of Order 82.
 
The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, requires an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals to obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules to offshore special purpose vehicles. Although we believe that CSRC’s approval is not required for the listing and trading of our common stock on Nasdaq, we cannot assure you that relevant PRC governmental agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as we do.
