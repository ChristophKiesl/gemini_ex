Overview
 
During 2020, the U.S. foodservice industry faced unprecedented challenges as the COVID-19 pandemic caused substantial disruption across many of our customers’ operations and, in some cases, resulted in permanent closures of restaurants. As a company, we took several actions to increase liquidity, conserve cash, manage working capital, and reduce expenses to align with the decrease in demand.
 
We also acted quickly to protect the health and safety of our communities by implementing new protocols and enhanced safety measures to protect our frontline associates and customers, many of whom are “essential workers” and unable to work remotely. As we adapted to rapidly changing conditions, we also increased our efforts to stay connected to our current customers and attract new customer.
 
As was widely reported in the media, the U.S. meat industry experienced meat shortages due to massive outbreaks of COVID-19 and in some cases large facilities were forced to close, meat prices reached an all-time high due to the lack of product and increase in demand. While many of our competitors chose to pass these increases in price to the customers, The Companies Management made a conscious decision to support our customers by lowering our margins in order to offset the increase in prices caused by the pandemic. By lowering our margins during the second and third quarters we attracted many new customers and won the loyalty of its current customer base.
 
The Company was able to maintain the historical average of the prior year’s revenues but did share the burden of the pandemic.
 
During the onset of the pandemic Seaport’s sales staff and management acted quickly to recover any lost revenue due to the massive government mandated shutdown. Some of our largest customers were forced to stay closed for almost a year which include Petco Park (home of the San Diego Padres), and the SoCal County Fairs. We acted quickly, and attracted more business from Hospitals, Nursing Homes, and Naval Bases just to name a few.
 
The Company made concerted efforts to let our customers know that we appreciate their loyalty and continued support during these challenging times.
 
Corporate History
 
Pacific Ventures was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3, 1986, under the name AOA Corporation. On November 12, 1991, the Company changed its name to American Eagle Group, Inc. On October 22, 2012, the Company changed its name to Pacific Ventures Group, Inc.
 
The current structure of Pacific Ventures resulted from a share exchange with Snöbar Holdings, Inc. (“Snöbar”), which was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes. On August 14, 2015, Pacific Ventures and its stockholders entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Snöbar Holdings, Inc. (“Snöbar Holdings”), pursuant to which Pacific Ventures acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Snöbar Holdings’ Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22,500,000 restricted shares of Pacific Ventures’ common stock, while simultaneously issuing 2,500,000 shares of Pacific Ventures’ restricted common stock to certain other persons, including for services provided and to a former officer of the Company (the “Share Exchange”).As the result of the Share Exchange, Snöbar Holdings. became Pacific Venture’s wholly owned operating subsidiary and the business of Snöbar Holdings became the Company’s sole business operations, and Snöbar Holdings’ majority owned subsidiary, MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation (“MGD”), became indirect subsidiary of Pacific Ventures.

Prior to the Share Exchange, the Company operated as an insurance holding company and through its subsidiaries, marketed and underwrote specialized property and casualty coverage in the general aviation insurance marketplace. However, in 1997, after selling several of its divisions, the Company’s remaining insurance operations were placed into receivership and the Company ceased operating its insurance business.
 
Since the Share Exchange represented a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations, the business operations changed to the Food and Beverage industry and the discussions of business operations accompanying this filing are that of Royalty Foods Partner LLC, DBA San Diego Farmers Outlet and Seaport Group Enterprises LLC, DBA Seaport Meat Company.
 
Snöbar Holdings was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2013. Snöbar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of Snöbar Trust, a California trust (“Trust”), which was formed in June 1, 2013. The current trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Azita Davidiyan. The Trust owns 100% of the shares of International Production Impex Corporation, a California corporation (“IPIC”), which was formed on August 2, 2001. IPIC is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops and holds all of the rights to the liquor licenses to sell such products and trade names “SnöBar”. As such, the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC and its liquor licenses, permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors, with all income, expense, gains and losses rolling up to the Trust, of which Snöbar Holdings is the sole beneficiary. Snöbar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation (“MGD”).
 
The Trust and IPIC are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and Snöbar Holdings is identified as the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification(“ASC”) 810, Snöbar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment of Snöbar Holdings’ management is that Snöbar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC), and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE’s economic performance, it was therefore concluded by management that Snöbar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such, the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of Snöbar Holdings since the inception of the Trust, in the case of the Trust, and since the inception of Snöbar Holdings, in the case of IPIC.

Description of Operations of Pacific Ventures Group, Inc.
 
General
 
On May 1, 2018, Royalty Foods Partners, LLC – a Florida Limited Liability Corporation and a subsidiary of Pacific Ventures Group, Inc. – completed an asset acquisition of San Diego Farmers Outlet, Inc. (SDFO), a California Corporation. San Diego Farmers Outlet was started in over thirty-five years ago to provide primarily restaurants customers in southern California’s three largest counties with quality food and produce and does business under the name of Farmers Outlet and San Diego Farmers Outlet.
 
Farmers Outlet provides a wide array of products to serve customers of all types. However, they do have a niche in providing fresh produce and food products. Farmers Outlet provides specialty produce that the larger distributors do not carry on a daily basis. Unlike some larger distributors who make their customers receive products on a day and time convenient to the distributor, Farmers Outlet delivers daily and pays attention to what the customer wants. Farmers Outlet added products to meet the needs of Restaurants, Hotels, Food Trucks, and Caterers.
 
Since the acquisition, SDFO has increased sales of its wholesale business, and still plan on expanding our current delivery territory from 25 miles to a 40-mile radius. SDFO has obtained 2 new delivery trucks to add to the current fleet of trucks. The Company has begun marketing to new restaurants in the area, most notably Asian and Italian restaurants, and have let restaurants know that SDFO can deliver the finest produce in market.
 
SDFO installed new signage around the retail market, added additional landscaping to enhance the appearance of the market, and purchased a new Point of Sale system to improve efficiency and ordering processes.
 
The Company will continue to evaluate its projected expenditures relative to its available cash and to seek additional means of financing in order to satisfy the Company’s working capital and other cash requirements.
 
Market and Strategy
 
Unlike some larger distributors who make their customers receive products on a day and time convenient to the distributor, SDFO delivers daily and pays attention to what the customer wants. Farmers Outlet added products to meet the needs of Restaurants, Hotels, Food Trucks and Caterers. Free delivery was added to demonstrate that Farmers Outlet had customers interest first in mind.
 
Farmers Outlet provides a wide array of products to serve customers of all types. However, they do have a niche in providing fresh produce and food products. Farmers Outlet provides specialty produce that the larger distributors do not carry on a daily basis.
 
Farmers Outlet covers a large market area servicing Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego, which we have estimated to be a $2.5 billion addressable market. Farmers Outlet currently services the San Diego territory and has over 125 active customers, and no customer represents more than five percent of Farmers Outlet gross revenues.
 
The company services customers in high, middle and low-income communities with a specialty in providing food and fresh produce to customers serving small to medium size restaurants of all nationalities, including Chinese, Korean, Mexican, American, Japanese and Thai.
 
Pacific Ventures intends to expand its business through the acquisition of other food manufacturing and distribution companies that serve the Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego area, thereby combining and expanding upon a combined customer base with an expanding range of products and services.
 
Pacific Ventures is establishing a new production relationship with a wholesale frozen food co-packing company that can meet our volume production and HAACP quality control requirements.

During the 2019 fiscal year, the Company completed an asset acquisition of PNC Inc, DBA, Seaport Meat Company, a company with over thirty (30) years in business servicing restaurant and retail, and institutional customers in Southern California and Arizona. Seaport Meat Company is a USDA meat processing plant that supplies quality meats, seafood, dry goods, dairy and produce. Seaport Meat Company is a food distribution and manufacturing facility in Spring Valley, California and is HACCP-compliant and is a USDA Licensed processing facility with on-site daily inspections. HACCP is a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of biological, chemical, and physical hazards from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Having a USDA certified facility allows consumers to be confident that the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the public health agency in the USDA, ensured that meat and poultry products are safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged
 
The Company’s customers range from a wide variety of restaurants, including many well known in Southern CA, to institutions, schools (UCSD, SDSU, etc.) and re-distributors such as US Foods and Sysco as well as to local distributors. They supply wholesale food and restaurant supplies to San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside and offer same day service. In addition, they have clients in Arizona and Colorado that come to their facility to pick up their orders.
 
Because Seaport Meat Company of America can efficiently add new product lines, it is expected that this will expand the distribution of Pacific Ventures’ San Diego Farmers Outlet and SnoBar product line, thereby accelerating Pacific Ventures’ revenue growth. We believe the combination of a distribution and product company is unique in the San Diego area and will position the company for rapid growth.
 
Seaport Meat Company manufactures and wholesales custom processed beef, pork, chicken, lamb, veal and seafood. In addition, they are redistributors of a wide variety of dry goods, frozen foods, disposables and janitorial products. Their sales, distribution and finance processes are very efficient and can be expanded to add new product lines, including fresh produce and dairy.
 
Trademarks
 
IPIC sells the SnöBar products under a number of trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to its continued success. The SnöBar brand is fully trademarked within the United States. IPIC’s business could be adversely affected by the loss of any major brand or by material infringement of its intellectual property rights. The SnöBar products are also subject to intellectual property risks because existing trademark laws offer only limited protection, and the laws of some countries in which the SnöBar products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not fully protect the SnöBar products from infringement by others.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, Pacific Ventures comprised five (5) employees who managed the affairs of the parent corporation and the operations of its subsidiaries. On an as needed basis, the Company hires independent contractors to perform specific tasks related to the Company’s business interests. Seaport Group Enterprises LLC has 49 employees. Royalty Foods Partners LLC has 15 employees.
