Item 1.   BUSINESS
Our Business
 
Frontera Group Inc. is a management company providing business development and market consultancy services. Our target clients are various businesses who are looking for assistance in the areas of marketing, sales and logistics as they expand their business operations. We specifically target these types of companies because of the experience our management has in providing marketing and consulting services.
 
We generate revenue by providing consulting services to small- and medium-sized businesses.  We acquire customers through direct marketing and referrals. However, currently we have no business operations and have not generated any revenue 
and ceased all operating activities as of September 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021.
 
Historically, our services have included:
 
Market and Competitor Research
 
Breaking into new markets is inherently risky due to the unfamiliarity of the competition and consumer demand. Our comprehensive market and competitor research allows our customers to have insight into their new target market. Our customers are better able to price their products and services competitively and position their brand effectively. Market research services include market, economic and political overview, logistics and cost environment, partnership identification, competitor research including availability of distribution channels, competitor promotional strategies and identification of specific differentiation opportunities. Market and competitor research

is the first step for a client's launch into a new market. These services are billed on a project basis, with the scope determined in collaboration with the client. Research can be done as a one-off service prior to a new launch, or as an on-going project with a smaller scope to monitor competition in a particular market.
 
Marketing Strategy Development
 
Essential to the success of entering a new market is an appropriate and effective marketing strategy. After establishing a budget and target market, we develop a marketing plan that can help our clients reach their potential customers. A core part of our marketing services is the design and deployment of specialized reports that capture, measure and analyze target market data to provide insights into market opportunities, value proposition, positioning and messaging development. The result is a custom Business Development plan that addresses overall marketing strategy for a launch to a new market.
Translation Services
 
Launching a product in a new market often requires adaptation of packaging, corporate identity documents, and marketing materials to a new language. Our translation services ensure complete compatibility with local culture and market conditions for any corporate communication materials.
 
Trade show and commercial event management
 
An important part of a product or service launch is effective presentation at industry and consumer trade shows. We ensure an effective presentation at trade shows by developing target market appropriate booth design and sales material, as well as helping to manage staffing and logistics. We also consult and manage other commercial events, such as marketing events, product demos, and public relations events.
 
Administration and On-Going Business services
 
We provide services offering ongoing assistance. The scope of services depends on customer requirements. We can provide one-off consultations regarding marketing or distribution strategies, resulting in short-term engagements. For customers who require extra support, we can act as broker of record for a line of products in a specific geographic area. We customarily charge the client a flat monthly fee, with an additional commission depending on a portion of sales made in the target market.
 
On August 9, 2017, we entered into separate Operating Management Agreement with three Chinese companies including Nanjing Xingfeng Agriculture Ecology Co, Ltd., Guoyang Huadu Properties Co, Ltd., and Xingguo Red World Camellia Oil Co., Ltd. None of these Operating Management Agreements have been performed since they were entered into. On January 1, 2019, we terminated all the Operating Management Agreement with three Chinese companies including Nanjing Xingfeng Agriculture Ecology Co, Ltd., Guoyang Huadu Properties Co, Ltd., and Xingguo Red World Camellia Oil Co., Ltd.
 On November 13, 2017, we and Jiangsu Rentian Agriculture Technology Corporation (“Rentian”) jointly entered into several Framework Agreement for Strategic Cooperation (“Strategic Cooperation Agreement” and collectively “Strategic Cooperation Agreements”) with the local governments from several counties in China including Danfeng County of Shaanxi Province, Xingguo County ofJiangxi Province, Datong County of Qinghai Province, Shangcheng County of Henan Province, and Guoyang County of Anhui Province. None of these Framework Agreements for Strategic Cooperation has been performed and therefore, on January 1, 2019, we terminated all the Framework Agreements for Strategic Cooperation with Danfeng County of Shaanxi Province, Xingguo County ofJiangxi Province, Datong County of Qinghai Province, Shangcheng County of Henan Province, and Guoyang County of Anhui Province.
 On November 13, 2017, Frontera and Rentian also jointly entered into a Strategic Cooperation Memorandum with Jiangsu Province Association of Restaurants and Food Services. Under this Memorandum, all parties will put together each of their own strength and expertise to formulate cooperation in the restaurant industries to gain market shares. This Strategic Cooperation Memorandum has not been performed and therefore, on January 1, 2019, we terminated this Strategic Cooperation Memorandum.
