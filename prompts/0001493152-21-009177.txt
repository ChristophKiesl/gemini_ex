ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

 
On December 31, 2018 Pure Harvest Cannabis Producers, Inc. (“PHC”) was acquired by the Company. At the time of the acquisition, the Company had 13,617,314 outstanding shares of common stock. The Company issued 17,906,016 shares of its common stock, as well as warrants to purchase an additional 17,906,016 shares of the Company’s common stock to the shareholders of PHC in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of PHC. The warrants issued to the former shareholders of PHC allow the holder to acquire one share of the Company’s common stock at a price of $4.00 per share at any time on or before December 31, 2021. PHC is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On February 5, 2019 the Company changed its name to Pure Harvest Cannabis Group, Inc. On March 15, 2019 shareholders owning a majority of the Company’s outstanding shares approved a two-for-one forward split of the Company’s common stock.
 
On June 16, 2020 the Company changed its name to Pure Harvest Corporate Group.
 
As a result of the acquisition of PHC the Company’s new business plan includes the acquisition of licensed medical and recreational marijuana dispensaries, cultivation facilities and production facilities in states which allow publicly traded companies to own and operate dispensaries, cultivation facilities and production facilities. Depending on the markets entered and state regulation, the Company’s plan may also include: asset purchases, management/consulting operating agreements, or similar allowable agreements. The Company plans to use a combination of cash, shares of common or preferred stock, notes, or other financing vehicles to complete these acquisitions.
 
As an alternative to a standard acquisition, the Company may use joint ventures and/or licensing arrangements to provide the Company with the same economic benefits as would be obtained from an outright acquisition.
 
The Company is dedicated to the research and development of the highest quality products to support patient health and well-being. The Company intends to develop into a large vertically integrated producer and distributor of cannabis initially targeting states with attractive markets that have legalized cannabis for both medicinal and adult-use. The Company will also enter markets that are in various stages of legalization with branded hemp derived CBD and terpene infused product lines. In addition to products tailored to marijuana retail dispensaries, the Company’s line will incorporate infused product options including beverages, edibles, topicals, concentrates, and distillates.
 
The Company’s goals include establishing the Company as an iconic consumer product brand that can be sold across multiple markets that have legalized cannabis and hemp-derived products either partially or fully. The Company’s products will include the highest quality natural ingredients to become synonymous with products consumers trust and rely on for active and healthy lifestyles.

The acquisition of a target company will be approved by the board of directors. The Company will not call a meeting of shareholders to approve the acquisition of a target company. Shareholders will not be entitled to dissenters’ rights in connection with the acquisition of a target company.
 
The Company may acquire companies that may be financially unstable or in their early stages of development or growth, which would subject the Company to the numerous risks inherent in such companies.
 
The Company is not prohibited from pursuing a business combination with a target that is affiliated with its officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with its officers or directors. In the event the Company plans to complete a business combination with a target that is affiliated with our executive officers or directors, the Company will not be required, to obtain an opinion from an independent firm that the business combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, the Company expects to conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with management and employees of the target business, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in the Company’s incurring losses and will reduce the funds the Company can use to complete another business combination.
 
Although the Company will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business which it may acquire, this assessment may not result in the identification of all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of the Company’s control, meaning that the Company can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
 
The acquisition of marijuana dispensaries and cultivation/manufacturing/processing facilities is subject to the approval of government authorities which license and regulate marijuana dispensaries in their applicable jurisdictions. No assurance can be given that any such approvals can be obtained.

On March 13, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests in Sofa King Medicinal Wellness Products, LLC (“SKM”) for 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.
 
On August 11, 2020, following receipt of approval of the transaction by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division, the Company closed the acquisition of SKM and the change of ownership on SKM’s six licenses (now owned by the Company) was completed.

The lease expires on April 30, 2022, but may be renewed for an additional five years at the option of the Company. The monthly rent is $8,000 for the initial three year term, increasing to $10,000 per month if the Company elects to extend the term of the lease. The lease is a “triple net” lease, which requires the Company, in addition to the monthly rent, to pay the cost of all utilities, insurance, repairs, maintenance and real estate taxes. The Company plans to remodel the buildings so they can be used by SKM.
 
The Company has an option to purchase the buildings at price ranging between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000 at various dates prior to May 1, 2022. The Company issued the landlord 400,000 shares of its post-split common stock in consideration for the option to purchase the buildings

Market Conditions
 
Legal marijuana sales in the United States reached $17.5 billion in 2020, according to ArcView Market Research/BDS Analytics. The research firm projects sales to increase to $41.3 billion by the end of 2026.
 
Adult-Use marijuana is now legal in 17 states and the District of Columbia, and medical marijuana is legal in 36 states and the District of Columbia.
 
While the industry is growing rapidly, the cannabis industry faces three major obstacles that challenge its growth and profitability. First, the cultivation of cannabis is a very capital-intensive enterprise. Many cannabis entrepreneurs do not have access to the capital required to build the infrastructure required to meet growing demand and sales projections. Traditional sources of financing, such as banks, are not available currently to cannabis producers and retailers. Second, there is shortage of knowledge related to virtually all areas of the cannabis business. When new states are added to the list of regulated cannabis markets, there may be a scarcity of experience and expertise to serve the needs of growers and retailers in these states. Third, as explained below, marijuana is illegal under federal law.
 
Government Regulation
 
Cannabis is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. However, the Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of March 31, 2021, 36 states and the District of Columbia allowed their citizens to use medical Marijuana. Additionally, 17 states, the District of Columbia and the country of Canada have legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults. However, the state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level.
 
The previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. In this regard, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.

The Cole Memo noted that the Department of Justice is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to Department of Justice attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following in preventing:
 

● | the distribution of cannabis to minors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; 
● | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
● | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
● | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 
● | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and 
● | cannabis possession or use on federal property. 

 
On March 21, 2018, President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion budget bill that includes a provision that prevents the Justice Department, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, from using funds to arrest or prosecute patients, caregivers, and businesses that are acting in compliance with state medical marijuana laws. This provision, known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to interfere with state medical marijuana programs.
 
During the confirmation hearings of U.S. attorney general William Barr, he made comments that he would not prosecute marijuana businesses operating within state law. Additionally, in April of 2019 Mr. Barr stated that he would prefer that Congress enact legislation allowing states to legalize marijuana instead of continuing the current approach under which a growing number of states have ended cannabis prohibition in conflict with federal law. The above notwithstanding, there can be no assurance that the Federal government will not seek to uphold federal law and supersede state law to prosecute cannabis companies.
 
On February 22, 2021, President Biden’s nominee for U.S. attorney general, Judge Merrick Garland, reiterated that he does not feel the Department of Justice should use its resources to prosecute people acting in compliance with state marijuana laws. This stance suggests enforcement and prioritization of marijuana-related activity will reflect that of the Obama administration.
