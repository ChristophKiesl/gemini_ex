Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Eargo, Inc. (“Eargo,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a medical device company dedicated to improving the quality of life of people with hearing loss. Our innovative products and go-to-market approach address the major challenges of traditional hearing aid adoption, including social stigma, accessibility and cost. 
 We believe Eargo hearing aids are the first ever virtually invisible, rechargeable, completely in-the-canal, FDA-regulated, exempt Class I and Class II devices indicated to compensate for mild to moderate hearing loss. 
 We market and sell our hearing aids primarily in a direct-to-consumer format, with a personalized, consumer-centric approach. Our commercial organization consists of a marketing team with deep experience in consumer-focused brand and performance marketing, a team of inside sales consultants, and a dedicated customer support team which includes audiologists and hearing professionals. Our differentiated, consumer-first approach empowers consumers to take control of their hearing by improving accessibility, with personalized, high-quality telecare-based support from our hearing professionals (with telecare support continuing for as long as a customer owns their Eargo hearing aid). 
 In an industry that has, in our opinion, historically been associated with limited brand awareness, we have developed a sophisticated brand-building strategy focused on consumer empowerment. We have also developed a robust technology and data-driven marketing platform that utilizes business intelligence, key performance metrics, machine learning and other marketing data to reinforce our growing brand recognition and to identify demographics, behaviors and marketing channels most relevant to our target audience. Eargo’s sales consultants leverage our digital marketing platform, which utilizes data-driven insights to iterate our sales tactics and create promotional offers, each with the goal of driving lead generation and increasing inbound lead conversions. We also see opportunity in nurturing long-term relationships with our customers to drive repeat purchases and increase their lifetime value, an objective facilitated by our provision of unlimited telecare access to Eargo’s hearing professionals for the life of a customer’s Eargo hearing aid. 
 We have also established a highly capable research and development organization with what we believe is a rare combination of expertise in mechanical engineering, product design, audio processing, clinical and hearing science, consumer electronics and embedded software design. In addition, we employ strategic intellectual property protection in certain key areas. Our technical capabilities and commitment to innovation have allowed us to deliver significant product enhancements on a rapid development timeline, exemplified by our launch of six iterations of the Eargo hearing aid system since 2017 (four of which we are marketing and selling as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
We believe that our differentiated hearing aids and consumer-centric approach have driven our sales of over 95,000 Eargo hearing aid systems, net of returns, as of December 31, 2021. We believe there is a large, growing and underserved market of people suffering from hearing loss, which we estimate included more than 45 million adults (or approximately one in six adults) in the United States in 2021, only approximately 25% of whom actually owned a hearing aid. 
 The Eargo Difference 
 We are passionate about helping people hear better and are on a mission to change the way the world thinks about hearing loss. 
 Since our inception, our founding principle has been to dramatically improve the consumer experience at every step of the hearing care journey. Our products, customer support and marketing messaging are a direct result of that passion. We believe our direct-to-consumer model can shift the paradigm in the treatment of hearing loss for the ultimate benefit of consumers.

  Eargo hearing aids 
 Eargo hearing aids combine proprietary technology, engineering know-how and scientific and design expertise to offer high-quality performance in an in-the-canal form factor that makes them virtually invisible. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are marketing four versions of our hearing aids—the Eargo Max, the Eargo Neo HiFi, Eargo 5, and Eargo 6—to provide customers with a range of cost and functionality options. Each generation of Eargo hearing aids has been improved with additional features, such as audio performance, enhanced physical fit and/or comfort and greater ease of use. 
 Our in-the-canal devices feature high-quality audio, are designed to provide up to 16 hours of battery life and feature Eargo’s proprietary soft and flexible medical-grade silicon tips. These silicon tips are removable, allowing for simple cleaning, and can be purchased separately in several sizes to accommodate individuals with different size ear canals. Eargo’s rechargeable hearing aids are designed for ease of use and maintenance while providing a comfortable fit for a majority of our target market. 
 The following features are available with Eargo hearing aids and offer advantages relative to traditional hearing aids (for example, the behind-the-ear format, which comprise the majority of hearing aids sold): 
 

• | Virtually invisible: Unlike the majority of hearing aids which sit behind-the-ear, Eargo hearing aids are designed to fit completely in-the-canal and are virtually invisible, allowing our customers to avoid the stigma that is associated with visible hearing aids.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Comfort and performance: Our proprietary soft and flexible medical-grade silicon tips allow Eargo hearing aids to be suspended in the ear canal and provide a comfortable “open fit” that does not fully block or occlude the ear canal while still providing high-quality audio.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rechargeable: Eargo hearing aids are rechargeable, eliminating the need for battery replacement. Our hearing aids come with a discreet, portable charger case that easily fits into a purse or pocket.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of use: Eargo hearing aids feature an intuitive design that is similar in quality to many high-end consumer electronics and allows for personalization by users to their unique hearing preferences. Users can cycle through up to four different sound profiles and personalize the settings to their unique preferences for amplification or noise reduction settings to accommodate listening in different environments. All products other than Eargo Max also offer customers a companion mobile application that helps them easily personalize their Eargo hearing aids to fit their needs and allow for remote updates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We expect to continue refining and improving Eargo hearing aids, and we have the intention of an approximate annual cadence of new product launches. To this end, we are working on the development of a cost-conscious offering as well as the next Eargo hearing aid model with improved functionality. 
 Our business model and customer journey 
 We sell our hearing aids primarily on a direct-to-consumer basis, engaging consumers through a mix of digital and traditional marketing as well as select commercial partnership, omni-channel (including retail) and other opportunities that are designed to appeal to prospective customers on a personal level and build our brand. 
 Eargo provides free educational resources as well as support from our team of sales consultants and hearing professionals, who help educate and guide prospective customers through addressing their hearing loss in a personalized and consultative experience. 
 While a hearing test is not necessary to purchase Eargo hearing aids, we offer an online, do-it-yourself hearing screening for prospective customers who are interested in learning more about their hearing. This screening is not intended to prevent, diagnose or treat hearing loss or any other disease or condition, but can assist customers in 
 
2 

  evaluating whether Eargo hearing aids may be right for them. Prospective customers can also utilize Eargo’s telecare support system to receive guidance regarding matters such as use, charging and cleaning of Eargo hearing aids, and real-time audio setting modification for individualized hearing loss. 
 Through select commercial partnerships and retail relationships, prospective customers may take our hearing screening and learn about our products in brick-and-mortar retail locations as well. 
 Customers are able to complete purchases over the phone with an Eargo sales consultant or directly on our website. The Eargo purchasing experience is designed to be simple and to improve the accessibility of hearing aids. In addition, we offer a 45-day trial period. 
 As of December 8, 2021, our products are “cash-pay” only, which includes upfront payment, credit card, third-party financing, and distributor payment. We partner with a third-party monthly financing program to make our products more accessible, and payment types may also be combined. The Eargo hearing aid system is then shipped and arrives on average in approximately three business days. 
 Once a customer purchases Eargo hearing aids, they are assigned to one of our hearing professionals, who provides complimentary, convenient support by phone, chat or e-mail. Our hearing professionals include audiologists with degrees in audiology and speech-language science, professionals with board certifications in hearing aid science and other professionals. 
 Once a customer receives their Eargo hearing aids, their assigned hearing professional will schedule a welcome call to assist with proper use, fit and setting modification of the Eargo device. In 2021, more than 80% of our customers completed a welcome call with one of our hearing professionals. Our hearing professionals and customer care team are also available to provide unlimited support for as long as the customer owns an Eargo device. Additionally, we provide short, online training videos and other resources that customers can access online. The combination of these services allows us to deliver telecare-based support in an efficient and streamlined manner. 
 We believe our business model and consumer-centric focus offer the following advantages relative to traditional sales channels (which are characterized by a business-to-business model in which hearing aid manufacturers rely on a fragmented network of independent audiology clinics to sell their devices to consumers): 
 

• | Simplified, consumer-centric experience: We have developed a consumer-centric experience by offering free online education, convenient consultation and telecare support, the ability to easily purchase the Eargo system, and fast delivery.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accessible: We offer all of our customers convenient telecare-based access to a highly trained clinical support team consisting, in part, of hearing professionals. Additionally, our support team is able to wirelessly assist in personalizing Eargo settings for our customers with Eargo Neo HiFi, Eargo 5 and Eargo 6.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Affordable: Our vertically integrated, consumer-first model allows us to eliminate a layer of cost associated with the separation of the manufacturer and consumer in the traditional sales and distribution model. As a result, we believe that we are able to offer Eargo hearing aids at prices that are approximately half the average cost of a pair of hearing aids purchased through traditional channels in the United States. The Eargo model also offers greater pricing transparency, as hearing aid sales via traditional channels commonly bundle the cost of the device, the audiology exam and related services (for example, programming and subsequent adjustments).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decreased COVID-19 exposure: Over the past two years, our model helped Eargo customers reduce their potential exposure to COVID-19 while conducting an essential activity without the need to physically visit a clinic.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Omni-channel marketing and distribution activities through commercial partnerships 
 Eargo’s self-administered hearing screens are intended to be part of our retail customer experience and are expected to be located in physical retail settings so customers can obtain general information regarding their hearing and see Eargo hearing aids in person. We also have a select number of commercial partnerships to, among other things, facilitate the retail experience, and we intend to continue to pursue additional opportunities for in-person customer engagement. We believe that if the proposed rule by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regarding an OTC regulation of hearing aids is finalized in substantially the same form as proposed, the final rule will facilitate negotiation and execution of additional retail opportunities in the future. 
 DOJ investigation and settlement and claims audits 
 As previously disclosed, on September 21, 2021, we were informed that we were the target of a criminal investigation by the DOJ related to insurance reimbursement claims we submitted on behalf of our customers covered by various federal employee health plans under the FEHB program. The investigation also pertained to our role in customer reimbursement claim submissions to federal employee health plans (collectively, the “DOJ investigation”). Also as previously disclosed, our largest third-party payor conducted an audit of insurance reimbursement claims (“claims”) submitted by us (the “Primary Audit”), which included a review of medical records. We were informed by the third-party payor conducting the Primary Audit that the DOJ was the principal contact related to the subject matter of the Primary Audit. In addition to the Primary Audit, we have been subject to a number of other audits of insurance reimbursement claims submitted to additional third-party payors (collectively with the Primary Audit, the “claims audits”). One of these claims audits does not relate to claims submitted under the FEHB program. On January 4, 2022, the DOJ confirmed to us that the investigation had been referred to the Civil Division of the DOJ and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas and the criminal investigation was no longer active. 
 On April 29, 2022, we entered into a civil settlement agreement with the U.S. government that resolved the previously disclosed DOJ investigation related to our role in customer reimbursement claim submissions to various federal employee health plans under the FEHB program. We cooperated fully with the DOJ investigation. We deny the allegations in the settlement agreement, and the settlement is not an admission of liability by us. The allegations did not pertain to the quality or performance of our product. The settlement agreement provided for our payment of approximately $34.4 million to the U.S. government and resolved allegations that we submitted or caused the submission of claims for payment to the FEHB program using unsupported hearing loss-related diagnostic codes. 
 The settlement with the U.S. government may not resolve all of the audits of insurance reimbursement claims by the various third-party payors, and additionally we remain subject to a prepayment review of claims by the payor who conducted the Primary Audit. We will need to work with the government (including the OPM) and third-party payors to potentially validate and establish processes to support any future claims that we may submit for reimbursement, and there are no guarantees that we will be able to arrive at any such acceptable processes or submit any future claims. We do not intend to submit any claims through the FEHB program until we are able to align with the OPM on and establish processes for supporting the submission of these claims. 
 From the time we learned of the DOJ investigation and until December 8, 2021, we continued to process orders for customers with potential insurance benefits (including FEHB program members) but suspended all claims submission activities and offered affected customers (i.e., customers using insurance benefits as a method of direct payment for transactions prior to December 8, 2021) the option to return their hearing aids or purchase their hearing aids without the use of their insurance benefits in case their claim is denied or ultimately not submitted by us to their insurance plan for payment (the “extended right of return”). 
 Beginning on December 8, 2021, we made the decision to stop accepting insurance benefits as a method of direct payment and it is uncertain when, if ever, we will resume accepting insurance benefits as a method of direct payment. While we intend to work with the government and third-party payors at the appropriate time with the objective of validating and establishing processes to support any future claims that we may submit for reimbursement, we may not be able to arrive at acceptable processes or submit any future claims.

  Total life-to-date payments we have received from the government through December 31, 2021 in relation to claims submitted under the FEHB program, net of any product returns and associated refunds, were approximately $44 million. As discussed further in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the settlement amount of $34.4 million associated with the DOJ investigation was recorded as a reduction of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 We determined that customer transactions using insurance benefits as a method of direct payment occurring subsequent to learning of the DOJ investigation on September 21, 2021 did not meet the criteria for revenue recognition under ASC 606. As such, we did not recognize revenue for shipments to customers with potential insurance benefits, substantially all of whom were covered under the FEHB program, subsequent to that date. 
 We estimate that a majority of customers with unsubmitted claims as of December 31, 2021 will choose to return the hearing aid system if their insurance provider denies their claim or the claim is ultimately not submitted by us for payment, resulting in an increase in expected product returns from such transactions that occurred prior to September 21, 2021. As a result, we recorded $13.3 million of estimated sales returns as a reduction in revenue in the third quarter of 2021 related to shipments to customers with potential insurance benefits. This has had a negative impact on the Company’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and resulted in an increase in the Company’s sales returns reserve. Of the $13.8 million sales returns reserve recorded as of December 31, 2021, $11.4 million relates to unsubmitted claims that are included in accounts receivable, net. Returns associated with unsubmitted claims will reduce the sales returns reserve, with a corresponding reduction in the related accounts receivable at the time the product is returned. 
 Further, we also estimate that, in addition to the customers who choose to return their hearing aid systems, a significant number of customers whose claims are denied by insurance providers or not submitted by us for payment may not pay for or return the hearing aid system. The $9.6 million in bad debt expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily based on this estimate and has had a negative impact on our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021. Of the $9.6 million recorded to bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2021, $5.8 million relates to submitted claims that have been denied or have not been paid and was written off during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Notwithstanding the settlement, we remain subject to prepayment review of claims by our largest third-party payor before any insurance payments are made. We do not intend to submit any claims through the FEHB program until we are able to align with the Office of Personnel Management (the “OPM”) on and establish processes for supporting the submission of these claims, and we may be unable to do so. 
 On January 5, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California consolidated three purported securities class actions brought against the Company (the “Securities Class Action”). While the lead plaintiffs have not yet filed a consolidated amended complaint, the complaints of the individual lawsuits filed prior to the consolidation generally alleged that certain of the Company’s disclosures about its business, operations and prospects, including reimbursements from third-party payors, violated federal securities laws. On December 3, 2021, a putative stockholder filed a derivative complaint purportedly on the Company’s behalf against members of the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company as nominal defendant (the “Derivative Action”), alleging (among other things) that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly failing to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls related to the Company’s financial reporting, public disclosures and compliance with laws, rules and regulations governing the business. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 
 As a result of the uncertainty created by the DOJ investigation and the claims audits, we took certain actions, including, but not limited to: 
 

• | We suspended our practice of granting equity awards, except for new restricted stock unit grants that we have the option to settle in cash at the time of vesting, suspended our 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and deferred the settlement of outstanding restricted stock units (“RSUs”), in each case effective as of November 9, 2021 (collectively, the “employee equity actions”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Our Board of Directors suspended the non-employee director compensation program with respect to the option awards that would otherwise have been awarded to non-employee directors automatically on the date of our annual meeting of stockholders held on November 9, 2021.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On December 7, 2021, we announced a plan to reduce our employee workforce to streamline our organization in response to declines in customer orders since we announced the investigation of the Company by the DOJ. We substantially completed the employee workforce reduction during the fourth quarter of 2021, resulting in a reduction of approximately 27% of our employee workforce, or approximately 90 people.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As a result of the DOJ investigation and the various claims audits, we were not able to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2021 (our “Q3 10-Q”) or this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. On November 16, 2021, we filed a Form 12b-25 notifying the SEC that we would be unable to timely file our Q3 10-Q. On November 18, 2021, we were notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing as a result of the delay in filing our Q3 10-Q with the SEC. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, we submitted a plan to regain compliance. Nasdaq granted us an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the Q3 10-Q original filing due date, or until May 16, 2022, to regain compliance. On March 2, 2022, we filed a Form 12b-25 notifying the SEC that we would be unable to timely file this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. On March 4, 2022, we were notified again by Nasdaq that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing as a result of the delay in filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, we submitted to Nasdaq an update to our original plan to regain compliance. Nasdaq’s notification dated March 4, 2022 indicated that any additional exception to allow us to regain compliance with all untimely filings will be limited to a maximum of 180 calendar days from the due date of our Q3 10-Q, or May 16, 2022. 
 On May 11, 2022, we filed a Form 12b-25 notifying the SEC that we would be unable to timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2022 (our “Q1 2022 10-Q”). On May 12, 2022, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying us that because we remain delinquent in filing our Q3 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K, and, in addition, because we are delinquent in filing our Q1 2022 10-Q, we had not regained compliance and will not meet the terms of the exception. The letter indicated that our securities would be subject to delisting on May 23, 2022 as a result of our non-compliance, unless on or before May 19, 2022 we request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel and request an extended stay of suspension or delisting. We intend to timely request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, at which hearing we will present our plan to regain compliance and request the continued listing of our securities on Nasdaq pending our return to compliance. Such request would automatically stay any suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq for a period of 15 days from the date of our request. The stay could be extended at the option of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel upon our request and support of such extension, and we intend to ask the Nasdaq Hearings Panel for a further stay concurrent with our request for a hearing and pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process. 
 COVID-19
We believe the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of consumer awareness of our vertically integrated telecare model and has facilitated customer adoption of the same. Shelter-in-place restrictions and increased reluctance of consumers to conduct in-person activities, particularly among older individuals that comprise a majority of the population needing hearing aids, has resulted in increased knowledge of our business and sales. We cannot be sure this trend will continue as the pandemic-related restrictions lessen and to the extent that customer preferences revert to pre-COVID-19 behaviors. 
 Because we were deemed to have an essential workforce under the relevant California COVID-19 measures, we were never required to close our facilities and we remained open throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in consideration of our employees, we permitted remote work or hybrid arrangements, where feasible.

  For a discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our supply chain and component and materials sourcing activities, please see “—Manufacturing.” 
 Seasonality 
 In the past we experienced seasonality in our business, with higher sales volumes in quarters when we launched new products and in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of holiday promotional activity; however, in part due to COVID-19 as well as a decline in gross systems shipped following announcement of the DOJ investigation and our related decision to stop accepting insurance benefits as a method of direct payment (as further discussed in “—DOJ investigation and settlement and claims audits”), seasonal factors did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Research and development 
 We are committed to ongoing research and development. Since 2017, we have launched six generations of our hearing aids (four of which we are currently marketing and selling), each adding performance and technical enhancements at different price points. 
 We are focused on continuing to launch new versions of the Eargo hearing aid with increased functionality and improved sound quality, amplification, noise reduction, fit, comfort, water resistance and ease-of-use, as well as reduced cost of goods and better connectivity. Our development priorities also include expanding and refining our refurbishment capabilities. We believe that the continued introduction of new products is critical to maintaining existing customers, attracting new customers, achieving market acceptance of our products and maintaining or increasing our competitive position in the market. 
 Manufacturing 
 The Eargo Max and Eargo Neo HiFi hearing aid systems are currently assembled by Hana Microelectronics Group (“Hana”), a contract manufacturer based in Thailand. A second manufacturer, Pegatron Corporation (“Pegatron”), headquartered in Taiwan and with manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, manufactures the Eargo 5 and Eargo 6 hearing aid systems. We rely on several third-party suppliers for the components used in our hearing aids, including semiconductor components, such as integrated circuits, as well as batteries, microphones and receivers. 
 We believe that these third-party facilities and suppliers will be adequate to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs. We do not currently plan to manufacture our hearing aids or any related components ourselves. 
 Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices and/or their component parts intended for distribution world-wide are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. In the United States, any products we sell are required to be manufactured in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities used for, the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. 
 The distribution of our hearing aids is handled directly through a third-party logistics provider. Our finished hearing aids are shipped from Hana and Pegatron to the third-party logistics provider’s facility and are distributed from there to customers. 
 While we have not been directly impacted by any major disruption to our supply chain or access to necessary raw materials and component parts for the manufacture of our products to date that have impacted our ability to service customers, disruptions have occurred across a number of industries and we cannot provide any assurance that future disruptions will not emerge as a result of the ongoing supply chain issues, inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic or other extrinsic factors. To date, increases in our product component pricing have occurred but have not had a material impact on supply continuity or gross margin. We have taken steps to monitor our supply chain and actions to address limited supply and increasing lead times, including outreach to critical suppliers and spot market purchases. For more information, please see the risks described under the caption “We rely on the timely supply of high-quality components, parts and finished products, and our business could suffer if suppliers or manufacturers are unable to procure raw materials or other components of an acceptable quality (or at all) or 
 
7 

  otherwise fail to meet their delivery obligations, raise prices or cease to supply us with components, parts or products of acceptable quality” in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on 10-K. For more information regarding the impacts of COVID-19, please see “—COVID-19.”
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2021, we had 24 issued U.S. patents, 22 patents outside the United States, 7 pending U.S. patent applications and 9 pending foreign patent applications. Our patents include utility patents covering technology ranging from remote control of our hearing aids to design patents covering the housing and securing mechanisms for our hearing aids. We have foreign patents in the EU, Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We own all of our patents and do not rely on any licenses to utilize the technology covered by these patents. The earliest of our patents is expected to expire in 2025. An issued U.S. patent with claims generally directed to an open ear canal hearing aid comprised of certain electronics and securing portions and an issued U.S. patent with claims generally directed to an adjustable securing mechanism for a space access device are each expected to expire in 2030. 
 Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents will protect our intellectual property rights. Third parties may challenge certain patents issued to us as invalid, may independently develop similar or competing technologies or may design around any of our patents. We cannot be certain that any of the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights in these countries as fully as in the United States. 
 There is no active patent litigation involving us and we have not received any notices of patent infringement involving any of our products. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 34 trademark registrations and 10 pending trademark applications worldwide. 
 Competition 
 We compete in the hearing aid market against manufacturers, clinics and retailers of hearing aids, other direct-to-consumer providers of hearing aids and, to a lesser extent, providers of personal sound amplification products (“PSAPs”). We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market are: 

• | product quality and performance, including but not limited to, the size, sound quality, comfort, whether the batteries are rechargeable, reliability and connectivity of the hearing aid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer purchasing experience;
--+--------------------------------


• | visibility of hearing aid;
--+---------------------------


• | pricing, including access to insurance benefits;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | product support and service;
--+-----------------------------


• | effective marketing and education;
--+-----------------------------------


• | technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sales and distribution capabilities.
--+-------------------------------------


After a period of industry consolidation, five manufacturers control a vast majority of the global hearing aid industry today. These manufacturers are GN Store Nord, Sonova, Starkey, William Demant and WS Audiology, all of which have established products and substantially greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and development resources than we possess. In addition to these manufacturers, we also compete against hearing clinics and retailers, such as Costco. Costco sells its Kirkland Signature label behind-the-ear hearing aids in store and also sells behind-the-ear, in-the-ear and in-the-canal hearing aids under the Philips, Phonak, ReSound and Rexton 
 
8 

  brands, each at various price points. We also compete against other direct-to-consumer hearing aid providers such as Audicus and Lively (which was recently acquired by GN Store Nord), which, similar to our business model, allow consumers to purchase hearing aids without visiting a clinic and provide remote support for their products. 
 Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, including with respect to changes to the industry landscape potentially arising as a result of the FDA’s Proposed Rule creating an OTC category of hearing aids (see “Government Regulation—Regulation by the FDA—Proposed Rule for OTC category for hearing aids” for more information). Creation of a new category of OTC hearing aids by the FDA could materially alter the competitive environment for hearing loss treatment. The FDA and the Biden administration have stated that the intention of the Proposed Rule to establish OTC hearing aids is to reduce barriers to access, foster innovation in hearing aid technology, and promote the wide availability of low-cost hearing aids. We expect the removal of regulatory barriers to entry will facilitate the introduction of new and varied product designs by incumbent and new competitors. 
 Considering the resources and advantages that our competitors maintain, even if our technology and consumer-first business model and distribution strategy are more effective than the technology and distribution strategy of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitor products in lieu of purchasing our products. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future, and may also experience intensifying pricing pressures, as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and distribution strategies and as new companies enter the market with new technologies and distribution strategies (possibly with increased frequency if and when the FDA finalizes its Proposed Rule, discussed above). We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. Our ability to compete successfully and to increase our market share is dependent upon our approach to addressing unmet needs in the hearing aid industry. Increased competition in the future could adversely affect our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, margins and market share. 
 Government regulation 
 We operate in a complex regulatory environment with an extensive and evolving set of federal, state and local governmental laws, regulations, and other requirements. These laws, regulations and other requirements are promulgated and overseen by a number of different legislative, regulatory, administrative and quasi-regulatory bodies, each of which may have varying interpretations, judgments or related guidance. For example, our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, design, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) also regulates the advertising of our products in the United States. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training, and other practices to government scrutiny. 
 As such, we utilize considerable resources on an ongoing basis to monitor, assess and respond to applicable legislative, regulatory, and administrative requirements, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to adhere to all of these requirements. Additional discussion on certain of these laws, regulations and other requirements is set forth below in this section. 
 If any of our personnel, representatives or operations are alleged to have violated these or other laws, regulations or requirements, we could suffer severe consequences, including material harm to our reputation, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, among other things. 
 We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to extensive and complex regulation, the scope and effect of which are difficult to predict. For additional detail on risks related to each of the foregoing, see the Risk Factors titled, “Changes in the regulatory landscape for hearing aid devices could render our direct-to-consumer business model contrary to applicable regulatory requirements, and we may be required to seek additional 
 
9 

  clearance or approval for our products,” “Our hearing aids are subject to extensive government regulation at the federal and state level, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could harm our business,” and “If we fail to comply with U.S. or foreign federal and state healthcare regulatory laws, we could be subject to penalties, including, but not limited to, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely impact our reputation and business operations.” 
 Regulation by the FDA 
 The FDA classifies hearing aids, including in-the-canal hearing aids such as our products, as medical devices. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), as well as FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, device safety, premarket clearance and approval, establishment registration and device listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, recalls and field safety corrective actions, and post-market surveillance, including complaint handling and medical device reporting of adverse events. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. The FDA can also refuse to approve or clear pending product applications. 
 The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices for devices, as reflected in the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), establishment registration and device listing, reporting of adverse events, and truthful, non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the premarket notification process set forth in Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls and any other special controls deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries and/or post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices must also comply with the FDA’s Section 510(k) premarket notification requirements. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, general and special controls alone are insufficient to assure their safety and effectiveness. Devices placed in Class III generally require the submission of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device, which must be approved by the FDA prior to marketing, or the receipt of a 510(k) de novo classification, which provides for the reclassification of the device into Class I or II. The PMA approval process is more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process; however, the 510(k) clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive. 
 We currently market our products pursuant to the FDA regulatory framework for air-conduction hearing aids and wireless air-conduction hearing aids, which are classified as Class I and Class II devices, respectively, and are exempt from 510(k) clearance requirements. While applicable FDA regulations establish certain “conditions for sale” of all hearing aids, including that prospective hearing aid users must have a medical evaluation by a licensed physician within the six months prior to the hearing aid dispensation or sign a waiver of medical evaluation, the FDA has stated that it does not intend to enforce these medical evaluation and waiver requirements prior to the dispensing of Class I air-conduction and Class II wireless air-conduction hearing aids to individuals 18 years of age and older. Accordingly, while we are required to comply with other FDA requirements, our products are currently not reviewed by the FDA. 
 
10 

  In May 2018, the FDA granted a de novo classification request from Bose for a direct-to-consumer “self-fitting air-conduction hearing aid,” which is classified in Class II and subject to 510(k) premarket review. Although our devices are not currently registered or marketed as “self-fitting” hearing aids, and we expect our products to continue to be regulated as Class I or Class II exempt devices, we may in the future seek clearance for one or more of our products as a “self-fitting air-conduction hearing aid,” or the FDA may require us to do so, subjecting such device or devices to 510(k) premarket review. 
 Proposed Rule for OTC category of hearing aids 
 The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDARA”) created a new category of over-the-counter (“OTC”) hearing aids that are intended to be available without supervision, prescription, or other order, involvement or intervention of a licensed practitioner. The language in FDARA is not self-implementing, which means that the OTC hearing aid category does not exist until there is effective regulation. On October 20, 2021, the FDA published a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish new regulatory categories for OTC and prescription hearing aids, among other things (the “Proposed Rule”). Under FDARA, the OTC hearing aid controls that are the subject of the rulemaking, if finalized, would preempt any state or local requirement specifically related to hearing products that would restrict or interfere with commercial activity involving OTC hearing aids. The comment period on the Proposed Rule, in which we participated in support of the Proposed Rule, ended on January 18, 2022, after which the FDA will review the comments. It is not clear whether the FDA will publish a final rule (the “Final Rule”), and whether the Final Rule will differ significantly from the Proposed Rule. However, if the FDA publishes a Final Rule, it would become effective 60 days after publication. 
 Under the Proposed Rule, devices that require 510(k) clearance to be compliant with the rule requirements would need to be cleared by the effective date of the Final Rule in order to continue to be marketed. For all other currently marketed devices, the proposed compliance date is 180 days after the effective date of the Final Rule (240 days after the publication of the Final Rule). 
 We market the Eargo hearing aid systems as Class I or Class II air-conduction hearing aids under existing regulations at 21 CFR 874.330 and 874.3305, both of which are exempt from 510(k) premarket review. Our hearing aids may be marketed under the current FDA framework during the FDA’s rulemaking proceeding. However, we cannot know to what extent the Final Rule may differ from the Proposed Rule. Once the FDA issues a Final Rule, we will assess the Final Rule and intend to take steps as appropriate to ensure that our devices and processes come into compliance with any new applicable requirements in order to market our products in the future. 
 510(k) clearance 
 If not exempted from the FDA’s 510(k) notification requirement, to obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, commonly known as the “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed in the United States prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (commonly known as a “pre-amendments device” based on the date the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted), a device which the FDA has reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device which has been found substantially equivalent to such a device through the 510(k) process. A device is considered to be substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence may sometimes, but not always, require clinical data. Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a 
 
11 

  substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once a 510(k) submission is accepted for review, the FDA has 90 days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. The review period is suspended during the time the additional information request is pending. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. 
 Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials or method of manufacture, or that would constitute a new or major change in intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an additional FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification constitutes such a change is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials generally require submission of an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) application to the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed to be a non-significant risk device which may be subject to more abbreviated IDE requirements. If an IDE is required, the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (“IRBs”) at the clinical sites must approve the study before clinical trials may begin. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, record keeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of IRBs for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices (“GCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for participation in each clinical study. The clinical trial sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the product. 
 Labeling and sale 
 All hearing aids commercially distributed in the United States must comply with specific FDA labeling requirements. These requirements address the labeling of the device itself as well as the User Instructional Brochure that must be provided to all potential hearing aid recipients. Hearing aids must be clearly and permanently marked with, among other things, the name of the device manufacturer, the model name or number, and the year of manufacture. In addition, the User Instructional Brochure must contain, among other things, specific instructions for the use of, maintenance and care of, and replacement or recharging of the batteries of the hearing instrument, information regarding known side effects that may warrant a physician consultation, a warning statement specified in FDA regulations, and technical data useful in selecting and fitting a hearing instrument and checking its performance. 
 In addition, FDA regulations require that the marketing of hearing aids comply with certain “conditions for sale,” including, among other things, the requirement that prospective hearing aid users must undergo a medical evaluation (or provide a signed waiver) before a hearing aid may be dispensed, along with certain recordkeeping requirements. In 2016, the FDA issued a guidance document stating that it did not intend to enforce the medical evaluation, waiver, or recordkeeping requirements prior to the dispensing of Class I air-conduction and Class II wireless air-conduction hearing aids to individuals 18 years of age and older. In addition, if the Proposed Rule is 
 
12 

  finalized as written, we expect that hearing aids marketed as OTC under the new framework must comply with specified labeling requirements and applicable conditions for sale. 
 Quality System Regulation 
 The hearing aids that we commercially distribute in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. This includes product listing and establishment registration requirements, which facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. We are required to adhere to applicable current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. We are also required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities, procedures and operations that comply with applicable quality and regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities, which may include the facilities of contractors. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from the QSR and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Noncompliance with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, FDA refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval to new devices, withdrawal of existing clearances or approvals, and criminal prosecution. 
 Post-market surveillance 
 We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, and any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. We must also comply with medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require manufacturers to report to the FDA corrections and removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. Although we may undertake recall actions voluntarily, we must submit detailed information on any recall action to the FDA, and the FDA can order a medical device recall in certain circumstances. 
 In addition to post-market quality and safety actions, labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the FTC. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including delays in or failures to report incidents to the FDA as required under the MDR regulations, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which can include any of the following sanctions: 
 

• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications or repair, replacement, refund, recall, administrative detention or seizure of our products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA refusals or delays on requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new or modified products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



13 

  
• | refusal to grant export approval for products; or
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
--+-----------------------------------------


Other healthcare laws and regulations 
 The healthcare industry is also subject to federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and physician payment transparency laws, as well as patient data privacy and security and consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations. Our operations are also subject to certain state and local hearing care laws, including those applicable to the licensure and registration of audiologists and other individuals that dispense hearing aids, sales and marketing practices, interactions with consumers, consumer incentive and other promotional programs, and state corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions. 
 Fraud and abuse laws 
 In addition to the FDA, other broadly applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations apply to our operations and business practices. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including our direct-to-consumer activities and sales and marketing practices as well as other business practices. Additionally, we are subject to numerous federal healthcare anti-fraud laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Physician Self-Referral Law and the False Claims Act, that are intended to reduce fraud, waste and abuse in the healthcare industry, and analogous state laws that may apply to healthcare items and services paid by all payors, including self-pay patients and private insurers. These laws are broad and subject to evolving interpretations. They prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in industries other than healthcare, including pricing, sales and marketing activities, sales commissions, customer incentive and other promotional programs, and the provision of gifts and business courtesies. We must operate our business within the requirements of these laws. Violations of any of these health regulatory laws may result in potentially significant penalties, including criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 In addition, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires manufacturers to report to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) detailed information about financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals and, with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021, financial arrangements with physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners. These reporting provisions preempt state laws that require reporting of the same information, but not those that require reports of different or additional information. Failure to comply subjects manufacturers to significant civil monetary penalties. 
 State licensing, corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions 
 Regulation of the hearing aid industry exists in every state. These laws and regulations are primarily concerned with the licensure and registration of audiologists and other individuals and companies that dispense hearing aids, including procedures involving the fitting and dispensing of hearing aids. In addition, most states require warranty and return policies for consumers allowing for the return of product, and restrict hearing aid advertising and marketing practices. These state laws are subject to change, and states may impose more stringent requirements for dispensers of hearing aids. The FDCA preempts state laws relating to the safety and efficacy of medical devices and state laws that are different from or in addition to federal requirements. Although courts in certain jurisdictions have held that certain state laws relating to the fitting and dispensing of hearing aids are preempted because they relate to the safety and efficacy of medical devices, interpretative legal precedent and regulatory guidance varies by jurisdiction and is often sparse and not fully developed, including which laws and regulations are subject to the federal preemption relating to safety and efficacy of medical devices, complicating 
 
14 

  our compliance efforts. Other courts could conclude that similar or identical state laws are not preempted. A determination that we are in violation of applicable laws and regulations in any jurisdiction in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if we are unable to restructure our operations and arrangements to comply with the requirements of that jurisdiction, if we are required to restructure our operations and arrangements at a significant cost, or if we are subject to penalties or other adverse action. Additionally, applicable federal laws and regulations continue to evolve. The FDA is currently engaged in a rulemaking process to publish a final regulation regarding OTC hearing aids. If the Proposed Rule is finalized as currently drafted, any state or local requirement specifically related to hearing products that would restrict or interfere with commercial activity involving OTC hearing aids would be preempted. 
 Our arrangements with hearing professionals may implicate certain state laws, commonly referred to as the corporate practice of learned professions, including audiology, and fee-splitting laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the audiologist’s or other hearing care specialist’s professional judgment. These laws vary from state to state, including those where we do business, and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. In the event that regulatory authorities or other third parties were to challenge these arrangements, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative interpretations, to civil or criminal penalties, our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable or we could be required to restructure our arrangements with our audiologists and other licensed professionals. Audiologists and certain other hearing care specialists are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice and must comply with numerous state and local licensing laws and regulations, and each state defines the scope of practice for audiologists and other hearing care specialists through legislation and their respective state regulatory agencies and boards. Activities that qualify as professional misconduct under state law may subject our personnel to sanctions or may even result in loss of their licensure and could, possibly, subject us to sanctions as well. 
 Privacy and security 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing privacy and security regulations, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) (collectively referred to as “HIPAA”), imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Additionally, HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the HHS, affected individuals and, if the breach is large enough, the media. 
 Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. 
 In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among 
 
15 

  other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Similar laws have passed in Virginia, Colorado and Utah, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The enactment of such laws could have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. In the event that we are subject to or affected by HIPAA, the CCPA, the CPRA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition. We may need to invest substantial resources in putting in place policies and procedures to comply with these evolving state laws. 
 We are subject to the GDPR in Europe, which went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Union (the “EU”) and the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EU and the United States remains uncertain. For example, in 2016, the EU and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the EU to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Further, as of January 1, 2021, impacted companies have to comply with the GDPR and the United Kingdom GDPR (“UK GDPR”), which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. While we continue to address the implications of the recent changes to European data privacy regulations, data privacy remains an evolving landscape at both the domestic and international level, with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal challenges, and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Accordingly, we must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with this changing landscape. 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States, like us, to comply with accounting provisions that require us to maintain books and records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. 
 
16 

  International laws 
 Globally, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. 
 Additionally, as described above, there are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information and, as in the United States, there are significant and complex laws and regulations pertaining to our products and business model. To the extent we expand internationally, we will need to expend time and resources evaluating and complying with any such laws and regulations. For more information, see the Risk Factors titled, “Any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “We operate in a regulated industry and changes in the regulations or the implementation of existing regulations could affect our operations and prospects for future growth.” 
 Environmental matters 
 Our operations, properties and products are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and waste and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. We believe that we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to us. However, our failure to comply with present and future requirements under these laws and regulations, or environmental contamination or releases of hazardous materials on our leased premises, as well as through disposal of our products, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, personal injury and property damage claims, fines and penalties, costs to redesign our products or upgrade our facilities and legal costs, or require us to curtail our operations, any of which could seriously harm our business. 
 Human capital management 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 257 full-time employees worldwide, of which approximately 250 were employed in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good. 
 Talent attraction, development and retention 
 Our success depends in part on our continued ability to recruit, retain, develop and motivate a diverse population of talented employees at all levels of our organization. To succeed in a competitive industry, our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. 
 In addition to acquiring new talent, we focus on growing and developing our existing talent. We conduct regular individual performance reviews in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to assist with employee development. We make investments to enhance employees’ skill levels and provide professional opportunities for career development and advancement. Our learning and development experiences focus on onboarding new hires as well as offering workshops focused on skills development and compliance training. 
 Our leadership team focuses on identifying the next generation of leaders to ensure that the organization is prepared to fill critical roles with employees who are prepared to support the strategy of the business and respond to the needs of key stakeholders. Furthermore, although we had a reduction-in-force at the end of 2021, we offered affected employees severance packages. Where possible, we offered opportunities for retraining and reskilling certain employees to reduce the impact of the reduction-in-force on our employees. 
 
17 

  Diversity & inclusion 
 We view diversity as integral to our future success. Diversity in our workforce fosters innovation, while inclusion helps ensure that we have the right culture, processes, policies, and practices to make employees feel valued and included. Developing teams where team members feel heard, respected, and included is one of our core values. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 40% of our total domestic workforce was female and approximately 25% of our employees in domestic managerial roles were female. Minorities (non-White) constituted approximately 35% of our total domestic workforce and approximately 35% of our employees in domestic managerial roles were minorities as of the same date. 
 Compensation and benefits 
 We focus on paying employees fairly and competitively. As a medical device company in the healthcare industry, we recognize the importance of compensation and benefits that are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our team members and their families. Our compensation packages typically include incentive plans comprised of discretionary stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards, health benefits, including options for medical plans, pharmacy, dental and vision coverage, a 401(k) plan, life and disability insurance, discretionary paid time off, family leave, a technology stipend for remote work, commuter benefit program, and a program for partial education reimbursement. Eligibility for, and the level of, benefits vary depending on team members’ full-time or part-time status, work location, compensation level, and tenure. 
 Health and safety 
 We remain focused on promoting the total wellness of our employees including resources, programs and services to support their physical, mental and financial wellness. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have augmented certain historical business practices to ensure that we promote the health and safety of our employees. While we were never required to physically close our offices, we provided, when feasible, opportunities for employees to work remotely. We have established safety policies and protocols, and we regularly update our employees with respect to any changes. We also have adjusted attendance policies to encourage those who may be ill to stay home. To further protect our on-site employees, we have made available personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies. We have also provided general information updates and support for our employees to ensure that they have resources and information to protect their health and that of those around them, including their families and colleagues.
