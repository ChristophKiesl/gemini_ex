BACKGROUND

Duo World has its registered office in Nevada, United States, and its development center in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

Duo World has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees, as well as our Board of Directors and officers. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on our website at www.duoworld.com. We will post on our website any amendments to, or waivers of, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
 
Overview
 
We have been transforming our business model from on premise/enterprise solutions to developing new products and enhancing our current products for the cloud-based, SaaS market. Duo World is now able to provide a complete on premise as well as cloud system to deliver great customer service experience.
 
With the launch of the cloud version, we plan to employ a strategic market approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant and consistent online content to attract new customers through content marketing.
 
The enterprise version of each of our new SaaS products is launched first in Sri Lanka and the region as a test bed prior to being launched in other countries. We expect that our SaaS solutions will reduce implementation and change request costs, while improving product profitability. We believe the transition to cloud-based SaaS product will allow us to focus more on product innovation than on deploying our resources and efforts to solve customer-specific issues.
 
Rather than catering our products to limited industries in a particular region or country, our new SaaS products will allow us to serve a global customer base that can be reached through our cloud presence, accessed by any user via the internet regardless of where they are located. We believe that our transformation from on premise/enterprise solutions to cloud-based, SaaS solutions has commenced exposing us to a greater number of potential customers and reduce our reliance on a few large enterprise customers.

Our Products
 
The following is a summary of our primary product offerings, which are fully developed and expected to launch to a broader customer base as outlined in more detail below.
Facetone
 
We launched Facetone in October 2016. Facetone is a communication and collaboration platform that provides the capability of efficiently operating on-premise or cloud-based PABX, IVR or call center. A PABX is a private automatic branch exchange and automatic telephone switching system. An IVR is an interactive voice response system that interacts with callers, gathers information and routes calls to the appropriate recipients.
 
Facetone for PABX provides advanced features such as call conferencing, call parking, call forwarding, voicemail and more. Facetone for call centers provides the capability to run a fully functional contact center with added features such as call routing and chat-based collaboration like Facebook, Viber and Skype. Facetone also uses artificial intelligence to facilitate automated customer communication.
 
The on-premise and Partner versions of Facetone were launched in 2016. The Partner solution is a hosted solution that operates similarly to a SaaS product from the client’s perspective. Under the Partner solution, we partner with leading telecom operators who host our Facetone solution in their data centers and offer the solution to their enterprise customers as a value added subscription service, with sales and support then provided by the telecom partner on an ongoing basis.
 
During fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022, we have recognized $41,697 and $78,409 in revenue, respectively, from Facetone.

Our Intellectual Property
 
We have no patents. Our trademarks are registered in Sri Lanka and will be registered in the United States in the future. Our trade secrets, copyrights and our other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and we generally control access to and distribution of proprietary information. These agreements generally provide that any confidential information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential. Further, we require all employees to execute written agreements assigning to us all rights in all inventions, developments, technologies and other intellectual property created by our employees.
 
There are events that are outside of our control that pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our propriety rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has approximately twenty (20) full time employees. We have employment agreements with our employees, and our officers. We do not anticipate any of our employees being union members.
 
All non-core activities are outsourced or subcontracted for greater flexibility and efficiency
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not involved in any legal proceedings.
 
Competitive Conditions
 
The subscription management and billing and customer lifecycle management businesses are intensely competitive. We have numerous competitors in the United States and abroad, many of whom have greater financial and human resources than we have. If we are unable to compete effectively and efficiently with our competitors, then we may not generate sufficient revenues and profits to stay in business, in which case investors in our Common Stock could lose part or all of their investments in the Company.
Business and Legal Developments Regarding Climate Change
 
We do not believe our business will be affected by business and legal developments regarding climate change.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we were an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 or “JOBS Act.” Effective April 1, 2022, we ceased being an “emerging growth company.”

As an emerging growth company, we were able to take advantage of reduced or “scaled” disclosure requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These reduced or scaled disclosure requirements include, but are not limited to:
 

1. | being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report; 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; 
3. | being able to take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
4. | being exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

 
We elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in our future filings with the SEC. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have irrevocably elected to not avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
Compliance after Termination of Emerging Growth Company Status
 
Since our emerging growth company status has terminated, we will no longer be able to take advantage of the reduced or scaled disclosure requirements described in subparagraphs 1. and 4., above. However, since we are a “smaller reporting company,” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, even though our emerging growth company status has terminated, we will still be able to take advantage of the reduced or scaled disclosure requirements described in subparagraphs 2. and 3., above, for as long as we continue to have smaller reporting company status.
