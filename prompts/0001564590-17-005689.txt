Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 We are a medical technology company focused on the design, development and promotion of products for the surgical treatment of spinal disorders. Our mission is to improve patient lives by delivering advancements in spinal fusion technologies. We have a comprehensive product and procedural portfolio, as well as a pipeline that addresses the cervical, thoracolumbar and intervertebral regions of the spine and covers a variety of spinal disorders from degenerative disease to complex deformity and trauma. Our principal product offerings are focused on the U.S. market for fusion-based spinal disorder solutions. We believe that our products and procedural offerings are attractive to surgeons, hospitals, and patients due to innovative features and benefits that are designed to streamline surgical procedures, improve patient outcomes, while delivering predicable results at lower costs.
Recent Developments
 On September 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our international distribution operations and agreements, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Japan, Brazil, Australia, China and Singapore and substantially all of the assets of our other sales operations in the United Kingdom and Italy, or collectively the International Business, to an affiliate of Globus. Following the closing of the Globus Transaction, we now operate in the U.S. market only.
 
Between September 1, 2016 and March 24, 2017, we announced several changes to our senior leadership team, including the appointment of Terry Rich as our Chief Executive Officer; Craig Hunsaker as our Executive Vice President, People and Culture and General Counsel; Jon Allen as our Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations; Brian Snider as our Executive Vice President, Strategic Marketing and Product Development; and Jeff Black as our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.
 
On March 29, 2017, we completed a Private Placement of our  securities to certain institutional and accredited investors, including certain directors and executive officers of the Company, providing for the sale by the Company of 1,809,628 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $2.00 per share, 15,245 shares of newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock”) at a purchase price of $1,000 per share (which Preferred Shares are convertible into approximately 7,622,372 shares of our common stock, subject to limitations on conversion until the approval by our stockholders as required in accordance with the NASDAQ Global Select Market rules), and warrants to purchase up to 9,432,000 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share (the “Warrants”), in a private placement (the “Private Placement”). The Warrants will become exercisable following stockholder approval, are subject to certain ownership limitations, and expire five years after the date of such Stockholder approval. The aggregate gross proceeds for the Private Placement were approximately $18.9 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement for general corporate and working capital purposes. 
 Strategy
 Our goal is to build a high-growth organization focused on innovation and value delivery.  By working with world class surgeons to simplify procedures and deliver better outcomes, we believe that we will be positioned to take a greater share of the U.S. spine market, becoming the partner of choice for spine surgeons, hospitals, healthcare systems and payors.
 To achieve our vision, we are committed to attracting, engaging and retaining the best talent in the industry, and investing in the following “vital few” strategies:
  
• | U.S. Commercial Execution and Growth – Dedicated and Loyal Sales Channel
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Currently, we market and sell our products in the U.S. through a network of non-exclusive independent distributors and direct sales representatives. Our goal is to deliver consistent, predictable growth through a durable brand commitment.  To accomplish this, we believe there is significant opportunity for us to partner closely with distributors to create a more dedicated and loyal sales channel for the future.  We are eliminating our stocking distributors and are moving our existing distributor relationships to more dedicated and non-competitive partnerships.  As part of this strategy we intend to add new, high-quality distributors to enable future growth.  We believe this will allow us to reach an untapped market of surgeons, hospitals and national accounts across the U.S., as well as further penetrate existing accounts and territories. We feel that the recent consolidation in the industry has afforded us the opportunity to partner with large, seasoned distributors that are looking to re-enter the spine market with our robust product portfolio that is solely focused in spine solutions.

We also employ a national accounts team that is responsible for securing access at hospitals and group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, across the U.S. We have had strong success with securing access to hospitals and GPOs and today much of our business is achieved through these accounts.  We believe that this access is a key differentiator for us.  We will continue to focus our efforts and investment in developing and maintaining relationships with key GPOs and hospital networks to secure favorable contracts and develop strategies to convert or grow business within existing accounts.    
 As part of this effort we are also significantly enhancing our specialized sales training and education programs for independent distributors and direct sales representatives to enhance overall sales productivity.
  
• | Reduce Costs and Drive Fiscal Responsibility Across the Organization – Financial Health and Wellness
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We plan to embed fiscal responsibility throughout our culture with the goal of remaining disciplined to sustainable standards and accountability at every level of planning and execution throughout the organization.  We are evaluating our existing processes in order to drive efficiency throughout the organization.  We will actively manage our cash and will work to ensure that all cash across the business is deployed with the goal of increasing free cash flow.  We are also striving to drive additional revenue by focusing our capital spend towards making strategic investments in commercializing our new products.   
  
• | Product Innovation Focus and Position in Spine
--+-----------------------------------------------

 We are dedicated to the development, launch and promotion of innovative products that simplify procedures for surgeons and improve patient outcomes. We support these products through comprehensive sales force and surgeon training and technical support. Our short-term and long-term pipeline is designed to offer us increased revenue opportunities by addressing the core market segments of spinal fusion, including both open and minimally invasive surgical, or MIS, pedicle screw systems, interbody devices, cervical plates and a comprehensive biologics offering.
 We are focusing our development and commercialization efforts on differentiated products that we can market through our sales channel.   These innovative products are designed to drive penetration within specific growth segments of the overall spine market, including the complex spine, deformity, and lateral markets.  In Q1 of 2017 we delivered limited market releases of the Arsenal™ Deformity Adolescent Scoliosis (AIS) System, the Battalion Lateral Spacer System, and the Squadron Lateral Retractor. We also plan to expand our distribution of these offerings as well as broaden our biologics portfolio through structural allograft, tissue and synthetic bone graft products to support surgeons during the surgical procedure with the goal of achieving high fusion rates.  
 Spine Anatomy
 The spine is the core of the human skeleton and provides important structural support and alignment while remaining flexible to allow movement. The spine is a column of 33 bones that protects the spinal cord and provides the main support for your body. Each bony segment of the spine is referred to as a vertebra (two or more are called vertebrae). The spine has five regions containing groups of similar bones, listed from top to bottom: seven cervical vertebrae in the neck, twelve thoracic vertebrae in the mid-back (each attached to a rib), five lumbar vertebrae in the lower back, five sacral vertebrae fused together to form one bone in the hip region, and four coccygeal bones fused together that form the tailbone. At the front of each vertebra is a block of bone called the vertebral body. Vertebrae are stacked on top of each other and enable people to sit and stand upright. Vertebrae in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions are separated from each other and cushioned by a rubbery soft tissue called the intervertebral disc. Strong muscles and bones, flexible tendons and ligaments and sensitive nerves contribute to a healthy spine.  Pain can be caused when any of these structures are affected by strain, injury or disease.
The Alphatec Solution
 Our principal product offering includes a wide variety of spinal solutions comprised of components such as access systems, interbody implants, fixation plates, thoracolumbar and cervico/thoracic screws and rods, best-in-class instruments, and various biologics offerings all designed to enhance and promote spinal fusion. Our business is focused on treating conditions from degenerative to complex deformity and trauma through a variety of MIS and traditional procedure.

Illico Minimally Invasive Surgery System
 The Illico Minimally Invasive Surgery System is a cannulated pedicle screw system that is designed to be inserted via a minimally invasive surgical procedure. Access to the spine is gained through a small incision. The surgeon is then able to see the surgical site by using a small canal through which implants are inserted into the patient with a minimum amount of disruption to the surrounding tissue. We believe that the Illico Minimally Invasive Surgery System limits trauma to the tissue surrounding the location of the surgery, which is designed to enable patients to recover faster.
BridgePoint Spinous Process Fixation System
 The BridgePoint system is a spinous process fixation system that was developed to address the disadvantages of traditional stabilization devices. The system allows surgeons to fixate the spine using a less invasive approach by attaching a plate to the spinous process of the vertebral body during spinal fusion surgery.
Thoracolumbar Fixation Products
 Arsenal Degenerative System
 Arsenal Degenerative Spinal Fixation System is a comprehensive system for both simple and complex degenerative spinal fusion procedures. The Arsenal Degenerative Spinal Fixation System was designed to provide operational efficiency, biomechanical strength, and surgical simplicity while providing a complete solution to combat most complex degenerative pathologies. We believe the combination of low-profile implants, intuitive instrumentation and proven strength of this system are significant advantages. The Arsenal Degenerative System was designed to be the platform for future development in other spinal fusion segments of the market including the deformity, MIS and cervico-thoracic segments of the market.
Arsenal Deformity System 
 The Arsenal Deformity System expands the Arsenal platform to address complex deformity including adult and adolescent diopathic scoliosis, or AIS, spinal deformity pathologies.  The system was thoughtfully designed to provide surgeons with a complete solution to address complex deformity procedures.  The system provides surgeons with unique uniplanar screws, which enable easier screw positioning and rod placement through a tulip that has 360 degrees of rotation while restricting motion in the medial/lateral plane for derotation correction.  Additionally, the system includes a wide variety of low-profile implants providing a better anatomical fit and increased ability to address patient pathologies, ergonomically designed instrumentation to improve surgical efficiency and comfort during complex surgeries and proven biomechanical strength necessary to achieve a solid fusion.
Arsenal CBx Cortical Bone Fixation System
 Arsenal CBx is the first extension to the Arsenal platform.  An alternative to traditional pedicle screw placement, Arsenal CBx Cortical Bone Fixation System utilizes a midline approach and cortical bone trajectory to achieve maximum fixation through a less-invasive procedure. This system leverages the strengths of the Arsenal product platform with the benefits of a minimally disruptive procedure to enhance patient outcomes.
 Due to the midline approach and inward-outward screw trajectory, soft tissue and muscle exposure requirements are greatly reduced compared to the approach for traditional screw trajectory.  Arsenal CBx is a compatible fixation option for both posterior lumbar interbody fusion or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, or PLIF and TLIF, respectively. Additionally, it can be a unique muscle sparing approach to revision surgery.
 Zodiac Degenerative Spinal Fixation System
 Our Zodiac Degenerative Spinal Fixation System is a comprehensive spinal system that can be used to address both degenerative spinal conditions, as well as deformity correction.  The system offers polyaxial pedicle screws, accompanying implants and advanced instruments for the stabilization of the thoracolumbar spine, as well as deformity specific instrumentation and implants that are designed to enable the surgeon to address patient-specific spinal deformity correction procedures.

Cervical and Cervico-Thoracic Products
 Trestle Luxe Anterior Cervical Plate System
 Our Trestle Luxe Anterior Cervical Plate System has a large window that enables the surgeon to have improved graft site and end plate visualization, which is designed to allow for better placement of the plate. The Trestle Luxe Anterior Cervical Plate System also has a low-profile design, which we believe is among the lowest in the spine market. Low-profile cervical plates are intended to reduce the irritation of the tissue adjacent to the plate following surgery. Other key features of the Trestle Luxe Anterior Cervical Plate include a self-retaining screw-locking mechanism that is designed to ensure quick and easy locking of the plate and a flush profile after the screws are inserted.
Solanas Posterior Cervico/Thoracic Fixation System and Avalon Occipital Plate
 Our Solanas Posterior Cervico/Thoracic Fixation System consists of rods, polyaxial screws, hooks, and connectors that provide a solution for posterior cervico/thoracic fusion procedures. We also designed the Solanas Posterior Cervico/Thoracic System to be used in combination with our existing Zodiac Degenerative Spinal Fixation System and our Avalon Occipital Plate, thereby providing surgeons with a solution for occipito-cervico-thoracic fixation. The Avalon Occipital Plate has a unique buttress design for optimal bone graft placement and superior fusion, including three points of plate rotation and translation, which is designed to ease the placement of the plate.
Interbody Systems
 Battalion Universal Spacer System
 The Battalion Universal Spacer System offers comfort, control and innovative design for surgeons performing PLIF/TLIF procedures. The Battalion implants introduce a new alternative to interbody fusion by combining the elasticity and radiolucency of polyetheretherketone, or PEEK, with a titanium coating for potential osseointegration.
 The implants, which come in both a straight and curved footprint, feature a bulleted nose for easy insertion. The Battalion System also features an intuitive and innovative 180-degree locking inserter that assists with protection of neural elements during insertion of the implant. To further market potential, the Battalion System features state-of-the-art instrumentation for disc prep, access and implantation.
 Novel PEEK and Titanium Spinal Spacers
 Our family of Novel spinal spacers addresses the surgical need to accommodate varying patient anatomies, surgical approaches and composite material options. We offer multiple unique implant designs, each of which is available in numerous shapes and heights. Certain of our Novel spinal spacers are made of titanium and others are made of PEEK. 
Alphatec Solus Locking ALIF Spinal Spacer
 Our Alphatec Solus locking ALIF spinal spacer, or Alphatec Solus, is a zero-profile PEEK and titanium device offering four points of fixation for improved stability. Alphatec Solus features a one-step insertion and deployment feature and is used in ALIF procedures. We believe that Alphatec Solus’ locking mechanism is a substantial improvement over similar products currently on the market.
Biologics
 AlphaGraft Structural Allograft Spacers
We offer a broad portfolio of allograft spacers available in a wide range of shapes and sizes, each with corresponding instrumentation, which are intended for use in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of the spine. In addition, many of our allograft spacers are packaged in our vacuum-infusion packaging system, or VIP System. The VIP System is a packaging and fluid delivery system that allows for fast and efficient infusion of the surgeon’s choice of hydration fluid. The VIP System provides rapid and uniform hydration, which may reduce the brittleness of the graft and shorten the length of the surgical procedure.

AlphaGraft ProFuse Demineralized Bone Scaffold
Our AlphaGraft ProFuse Demineralized Bone Scaffold consists of a sponge-like demineralized bone matrix that has been pre-cut into sizes to fit within a spinal spacer. The AlphaGraft ProFuse Demineralized Bone Scaffold provides a natural scaffold derived entirely from bone that can be placed into a void within a spinal spacer or on top of a spinal spacer. The sponge-like qualities of the scaffold allow a surgeon to compress the scaffold and place it into a small space. Following placement, the scaffold expands for maximum contact between the spinal spacer and the endplate of the vertebral body and is designed to promote fusion. The AlphaGraft ProFuse Demineralized Bone Scaffold is pre-packaged in our proprietary VIP System. 
 Amnioshield Amniotic Tissue Barrier
Our Amnioshield Amniotic Tissue Barrier is an allograft for spinal surgical barrier applications. The composite amniotic membrane reduces inflammation and enhances healing at the surgical site, reduces scar tissue formation and provides an excellent dissection plane. 
 Alphagraft Demineralized Bone Matrix
Our Alphagraft Demineralized Bone Matrix consists of demineralized human tissue that is mixed with a bioabsorbable carrier and intended for use in surgery for bone grafting.
Neocore Osteoconductive Matrix
 Our Neocore Osteoconductive Matrix is designed to provide an effective core environment for bone growth through a synthetic scaffold.  When hydrated with patient bone marrow aspirate, or BMA, Neocore becomes a complete bone graft, which possesses all the necessary components of bone growth.  Engineered to perform like natural bone, Neocore's composition and porosity provide the benefits of rapid revascularization throughout graft and supports replacement of three-dimensional matrix with healthy new bone growth. Offering excellent handling characteristics, these pre-formed strips are flexible to conform to adjacent structures, compressible, and moldable. 
Research and Development 
 Our research and development department seeks to continually improve our core product offering and introduce new products to increase our penetration in the U.S. spine market. We are focused on developing technology platforms that span the largest market segments addressing degenerative and deformity spine pathologies. We have transformed our development process by focusing our resources on two major development programs per year and leveraging integrated teams focused on the key platforms to reduce the time frame from product concept to market commercialization. We also collaborate with our surgeon partners to design products to enhance the surgeon experience, simplify surgical techniques, and reduce overall costs, while improving patient outcomes. Our product development efforts are fully integrated in one facility allowing us to bring products from concept to market rapidly responding to surgeon and patient needs. Our resources include a technology advancement cell for rapid prototyping, a cadaveric lab, and mechanical testing laboratory.
Sales and Marketing
 We market and sell our products through a sales force consisting of exclusive and non-exclusive independent distributors and employee direct sales representatives.  We employ a team of regional sales managers who are responsible for overseeing the overall sales channel process in their territories. Although surgeons in the U.S. typically make the ultimate decision to use our products, we generally bill the hospital for the products that are used and pay commissions to the sales representative or the sales agent based on payment received from the hospital. We compensate our direct sales employees and regional sales managers through salaries and incentive bonuses based on performance measures.  
 In late 2016 we evaluated our sales distribution channel and are currently in the process of making significant changes to drive a more dedicated and loyal sales channel.  Moving forward we intend to eliminate our traditional stocking distributors, move our existing distributor relationships to more exclusive partnerships and attract new, high-quality distributors to enable future growth.  We believe these changes will provide us with significant opportunity for future growth as we secure more exclusive distribution partners that can further penetrate existing and new geographic markets.
 We evaluate and select our distribution partners and sales employees based on their expertise in selling spinal devices, reputation within the surgeon community, geographical coverage and established sales network. 
 6

We also employ a national accounts team that is responsible for securing access at hospitals and GPOs, across the U.S. We have had strong success with securing access to hospitals and GPOs.  We believe this access is a key differentiator for us and much of our current business is achieved through these accounts.  We will continue to focus our efforts and investment on developing and maintaining relationships with key GPOs and hospital networks to secure favorable contracts and develop strategies to convert or grow business within existing accounts.      
 We market our products at various industry conferences, organized surgical training courses, and in industry trade journals and periodicals.
 Surgeon Training and Education
 We focus our surgeon training efforts on delivering critical technical skills needed on the entire spinal fusion procedure through a peer-to-peer approach to qualified surgeon customers.  Well-timed surgeon education programs drive customer conversion and loyalty through leadership and excellence by focusing on delivering value through improved surgeon outcomes.  We devote significant resources to training and education and are committed to a culture of scientific excellence and ethics.
 We believe that one of the most effective ways to introduce and build market demand for our products is by training and educating spine surgeons, independent distributors, and direct sales representatives in the benefits and use of our products.  Sales training programs will be a platform for learning and organizational development, ensuring the sales force is clinically competitive and considered an essential resource to all stakeholders.  We focus on cross functional collaboration and alignment to deliver timely and relevant programs to meet surgeon and representative needs and positively impact the business.  
 Our training and education programs are designed to support new product introductions to the market as well as ongoing portfolio advancement.  Our resources are nimble and responsive and include field based engagements to supplement our core curriculum.  We believe this is an effective way to increase overall surgeon adoption of our new products.
We believe that surgeons, independent distributors, and direct sales representatives will become exposed to the merits and distinguishing features of our products through our training and education programs, and that such exposure will increase the use and promotion of our products. With a focus on the entire procedure, we expect to build awareness of the breadth of our product offering.  We are conscientious in the pursuit of delivering value to all stakeholders.  Our goal is to provide surgeon education programs coupled with a growing and comprehensive sales training platform that create a sustainable competitive advantage for our organization.
 Manufacture and Supply
 We rely on third-party suppliers for the manufacture of all our implants and instruments. Outsourcing implant manufacturing reduces our need for capital investment and reduces operational expense. Additionally, outsourcing provides expertise and capacity necessary to scale up or down based on demand for our products.  We select our suppliers to ensure that all of our products are safe, effective, adhere to all applicable regulations, are of the highest quality, and meet our supply needs. We employ a rigorous supplier assessment, qualification, and selection process targeted to suppliers that meet the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Our quality assurance process monitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits.
 The raw materials used in the manufacture of our non-biologic products are principally titanium, titanium alloys, stainless steel, cobalt chrome, ceramic, allograft, and PEEK. With the exception of PEEK, none of our raw material requirements is limited to any significant extent by critical supply. We are subject to the risk that Invibio, one of a limited number of PEEK suppliers, will fail to supply PEEK in adequate amounts and in a timely manner. We believe our supplier relationships and quality processes will support our potential capacity needs for the foreseeable future.
 With respect to biologics products, we are FDA-registered and licensed in the states of California, New York, and Florida, the only states that currently require licenses. Our facility and the facilities of the third-party suppliers we use are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. Because our biologics products are processed from human tissue, maintaining a steady supply can sometimes be challenging. We have not experienced significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements, and we have not experienced a meaningful disruption to sales orders.

Divestiture of International Business
 On September 1, 2016, we closed a sale of our international distribution operations and agreements to Globus Medical Ireland, Ltd., or the Buyer, a subsidiary of Globus Medical, Inc., or Globus, or the Globus Transaction.  Pursuant to the Globus Transaction, Globus acquired: (i) all of the stock of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Japan, Brazil, Australia, China and Singapore; (ii) substantially all of the assets of our other sales operations in the United Kingdom and Italy; and (iii) all of the other assets that are related to the business of the design, development, marketing, promotion and sale of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders that we market and sell outside of the United States.  The Globus Transaction was completed pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement, dated as of July 25, 2016, as amended, or the Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement we have agreed to not market and sell spinal implant products outside of the United States for a period beginning after the closing of the Globus Transaction and ending two years following the termination of the Supply Agreement defined below. 
 Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, at the closing of the Globus Transaction the Buyer paid us $80 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment.  In addition, at the closing of the Globus Transaction we entered into a five-year term credit facility agreement, or the Globus Facility Agreement, with Globus, pursuant to which Globus agreed to loan us up to $30 million. 
 In addition, at the closing of the Globus Transaction, we and Globus entered into a product manufacture and supply agreement, or the Supply Agreement, pursuant to which, at agreed-upon prices, we agreed to supply to Globus certain of our implants and instruments that at the time were being offered for sale by us outside of the United States.  Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, we will be responsible for ensuring that all of the products delivered to Globus meet all agreed-upon specifications for such products.  The Supply Agreement has an initial term of three years, and Globus has the right to renew the Supply Agreement for two additional 12-month periods; subject to Globus meeting certain purchase requirements.
 Competition
 Although we believe that our current broad product portfolio and development pipeline is differentiated and has numerous competitive advantages, the spinal implant industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change, and significantly affected by new product introductions. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | improved outcomes for spine pathology procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | ease of use, quality and reliability of product portfolio;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | effective and efficient sales, marketing and distribution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | quality service and an educated and knowledgeable sales network;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | technical leadership and superiority;
--+--------------------------------------


• | surgeon services, such as training and education;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | responsiveness to the needs of surgeons;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | acceptance by spine surgeons;
--+------------------------------


• | product price and qualification for reimbursement; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | speed to market.
--+-----------------

 Both our currently marketed products and any future products we commercialize are subject to intense competition. We believe that our most significant competitors are Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Johnson & Johnson (DePuy/Synthes), Stryker, NuVasive, Zimmer, Biomet, Globus, K2M Medical, SeaSpine and others, many of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do. In addition, these companies may have more established distribution networks, entrenched relationships with physicians and greater experience in developing, launching, marketing, distributing and selling spinal implant products.
 Some of our competitors also provide non-operative therapies for spine disorder conditions. While these non-operative treatments are considered to be an alternative to surgery, surgery is typically performed in the event that non-operative treatments are unsuccessful. We believe that, to date, these non-operative treatments have not caused a material reduction in the demand for surgical treatment of spinal disorders.

Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements, proprietary information ownership agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop, maintain and enforce the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We require our employees, consultants, co-developers, distributors and advisors to execute agreements governing the ownership of proprietary information and use and disclosure of confidential information in connection with their relationship with us. In general, these agreements require these individuals and entities to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions that were conceived on our behalf or which relate to our property or business and to keep our confidential information confidential and only use such confidential information in connection with our business.
Patents
 As of March 14, 2017, we and our affiliates owned, or exclusively owned 111 issued U.S. patents, 72 pending U.S. patent applications and 231 issued or pending foreign patents. We own multiple patents relating to unique aspects and improvements for several of our products. We do not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position.
Trademarks
 As of March 14, 2017, we and our affiliates owned 72 registered U.S. trademarks and 148 registered trademarks outside of the U.S..
 Government Regulation
 Our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other U.S. federal and state regulatory bodies and comparable authorities in other countries. Our products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of our tissue products, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA.  
To ensure that our products are safe and effective for their intende
d use, the 
FDA regulates, among other things, the following activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform:
  
• | product design and development;
--+--------------------------------


• | product testing;
--+-----------------


• | non-clinical and clinical research;
--+------------------------------------


• | product manufacturing;
--+-----------------------


• | product labeling;
--+------------------


• | product storage;

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation – Medical Devices
 FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States 
will require either FDA clearance of a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, also referred to as a 
510(k) clearance, or approval of a premarket approval application, o
r PMA. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Under the FDCA medical devices are classified into one of 
three classes —Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of 
risk associated with the use of the device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory controls deemed to be necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. 
 9

Class I devices are those with the lowest risk to the patient for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require 510(k) clearance by the FDA, though most Class I devices are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.  Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, product-specific guidance documents and postmarket surveillance. Manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA.  Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by compliance with the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices must be the subject of an approved PMA.  Both 510(k)s and PMAs are subject to the payment of user fees at the time of submission for FDA review.
 If the FDA determines that the device is not "substantially equivalent" to a predicate device following submission and review of a 510(k) premarket notification, or if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk, the device sponsor may either pursue a PMA approval or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Our current products on the market in the U.S. are Class II devices marketed under FDA 510(k) premarket clearance. 
 510(k) Clearance Pathway
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a device legally marketed in the United States. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and 
for which a PMA is 
not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process.  To be "substantially equivalent," the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 The FDA’s goal i
s to review and act on each 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but the process usually takes from nine to 12 months, and it may take longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k)s do not require supporting data from clinical trials, but 
the FDA may request such data.  If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety 
or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require premarket approval. The FDA requires each 
manufacturer to determine whether the proposed ch
ange requires the 
submission of a 510(k) or PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketin
g and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA 
is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified 
device until we obtain this clearance or approval. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant fines or penalties. We have made and plan to continue to make enhancements to our products for which we have not submitted 510(k)s or PMAs, and we will consider on a case-by-case basis whether a new 510(k) or PMA is necessary.
 The FDA began to consider proposals to reform its 510(k) marketing clearance process in 2011, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period. Specifically, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the 510(k) program, and as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several “Medical Device Regulatory Improvements” and miscellaneous reforms, which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-clearance and approval.  Further, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law.  The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of devices and spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is unclear.
 10

Premarket Approval Pathway
 Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are 
cleared through the 510(k) process.  The PMA process is generally more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, extensive 
technical information regarding device design and development
, preclinical and 
clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling information 
to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA's satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.  Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is 
sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.  If 
the FDA accepts 
the application for review, it 
has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its 
review of the PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and 
can take up to several 
years.  During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant's response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA
. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation.  
In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulation, or QSR. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy, and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are almost always 
required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k). All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators.   If 
the device is determined to present a “significant risk” to human health, the manufacturer may not begin
 a clinical trial until it submits an IDE 
application to the FDA and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. The IDE must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in human
s and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board
, or IRB, for 
each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. A clinical trial may be suspended by FDA, the sponsor or an IRB at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the FDA, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device.
 Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
  
• | registration and listing requirements, which require manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party contract manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, supplier/contractor selection, documentation, record maintenance and other quality assurance controls, during all aspects of the manufacturing process and to maintain and investigate complaints;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advertising and promotion requirements;
--+----------------------------------------


• | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved “off-label” uses;medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers submit reports to the FDA of device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur;;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11

 
• | medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | device tracking requirements; and
--+----------------------------------


• | other post-market surveillance requirements, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following:
  
• | warning letters and untitled letters;
--+--------------------------------------


• | fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | recalls, withdrawals, administrative detention, or seizure of products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawals of 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new products; and/or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes 
are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to evaluate compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
 Regulation of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-based Products
 Certain of our products are regulated as human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps.  Section 361 of the PHSA authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, or Good Tissue Practice, when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting, among other applicable requirements and laws. If the HCT/P is minimally manipulated, is intended for homologous use only and meets other requirements, the HCT/P will not require 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, a Biologics License Applications, or other premarket authorization from the FDA before marketing.
Environmental Matters
 Our facilities and operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions; wastewater discharges; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes; the cleanup of contamination; and the health and safety of our employees. Under such laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury.
Compliance with Certain Applicable Statutes 
 We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, criminal health care fraud laws, physician payment transparency laws, data privacy and security laws and foreign corrupt practice laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and state attorneys general. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years.
 12

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. For example, the definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, which, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, and collectively referred to as ACA. ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
 In implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has issued a series of regulations, known as the safe harbors, which began in July 1991. These safe harbors set forth provisions that, in circumstances where all the applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have anti-kickback laws that are similar to the federal law, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, and may also result in penalties, fines, sanctions for violations, and exclusions from state or commercial programs.
 We have entered into various agreements with certain surgeons that perform services for us, including some who make clinical decisions to use our products. Some of our referring surgeons own our stock, which they received from us as consideration for services performed.  From time to time, we review these arrangements to determine whether they are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  In addition, physician-owned distribution companies, or PODs, have increasingly become involved in the sale and distribution of medical devices, including products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders. In many cases, these distribution companies enter into arrangements with hospitals that bill Medicare or Medicaid for the furnishing of medical services, and the physician-owners are among the physicians who refer patients to the hospitals for surgery. On March 26, 2013 the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert entitled "Physician-Owned Entities", or the Fraud Alert, in which the OIG concluded, among other
 things, that PODs are "inherently suspect under the anti-kickback statute" and that PODs present "substantial fraud and abuse risk and pose dangers of patient safety." Since 2013, the OIG has further increased its scrutiny of PODs and the Department of Justice has brought several high-profile cases against physician owners. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Private suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claim Act action. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $10,000 to $22,000 for each separate false claim and may be subject to exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Various states have also enacted similar laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The ACA changed the intent requirement of the healthcare fraud statute to such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in similar sanctions.
 13

ACA also includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement in addition to those changes discussed above. Among these additional provisions include increased funding for enforcement efforts and new “sunshine” provisions to require us to report and disclose to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, any payment or “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals. These sunshine provisions also require certain group purchasing organizations, including physician-owned distributors, to disclose physician ownership information to CMS. We and other device manufacturers are required to collect and annually report specific data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. There are various state laws and initiatives that require device manufacturers to disclose to the appropriate regulatory agency certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, and in certain cases prohibit some forms of these payments, with the risk of fines for any violation of such requirements.
 HIPAA also includes privacy and security provisions designed to regulate the use and disclosure of “protected health information”, or PHI, which is health information that identifies a patient and that is held by a health care provider, a health plan or health care clearinghouse. We are not directly regulated by HIPAA, but our ability to access PHI for purposes such as marketing, product development, clinical research or other uses is controlled by HIPAA and restrictions placed on health care providers and other covered entities. HIPAA was amended in 2009 by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which strengthened the rule, increased penalties for violations and added a requirement for the disclosure of breaches to affected individuals, the government and in some cases the media. We must carefully structure any transaction involving PHI to avoid violation of HIPAA and HITECH requirements.
 Almost all states have adopted data security laws protecting personal information including social security numbers, state issued identification numbers, credit card or financial account information coupled with individuals’ names or initials. We must comply with all applicable state data security laws, even though they vary extensively, and must ensure that any breaches or accidental disclosures of personal information are promptly reported to affected individuals and responsible government entities. We must also ensure that we maintain compliant, written information security programs or run the risk of civil or even criminal sanctions for non-compliance as well as reputational harm for publicly reported breaches or violations.
 If any of our operations are found to have violated or be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, among them being civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Third-Party Reimbursement 
 In the U.S., healthcare providers generally rely on third-party payors, principally private insurers and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and pay for all or part of the cost of a spine surgery in which our medical devices are used. We expect that sales volumes and prices of our products will depend in large part on the continued availability of reimbursement from such third-party payors. These third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not medically necessary in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Particularly in the U.S., third-party payors continue to carefully review, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products. Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies are developed by CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, and its contractors. CMS establishes these Medicare policies for medical products and procedures and such policies are periodically reviewed and updated. While private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies, the Medicare program is viewed as a benchmark. Medicare payment rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of the facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover and provide adequate payment for the procedures in which our products are used. ACA and other reform proposals contain significant changes regarding Medicare, Medicaid and other third party payors.
 Among these changes was the imposition of a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices that went into effect on January 1, 2013. This tax has resulted in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry. In December 2015, the U.S. Congress adopted and President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016.  Among other things, this legislation put in place a two-year moratorium on the device tax through the end of 2017.  Other elements of the ACA include numerous provisions to limit Medicare spending through reductions in various fee schedule payments and by instituting more sweeping payment reforms, such as bundled payments for episodes of care, the establishment of “accountable care organizations” under which hospitals and physicians will be able to share savings that result from cost control efforts, comparative effectiveness research, value-based purchasing, and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board. 
 14

We expect that the new Presidential administration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. Since its enactment, there have also been other judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the ACA. In March 2017, the United States House of Representatives introduced legislation known as the American Health Care Act, or the AHCA, which, if enacted, would amend or repeal significant portions of the ACA. Among other changes, the AHCA, would repeal the medical device tax, eliminate penalties on individuals and employers that fail to maintain or provide minimum essential coverage and create refundable tax credits to assist individuals in buying health insurance. The AHCA would also make significant changes to Medicaid by, among other things, making Medicaid expansion optional for states, repealing the requirement that state Medicaid plans provide the same essential health benefits that are required by plans available on the exchanges, modifying federal funding, including implementing a per capita cap on federal payments to states, and changing certain eligibility requirements. While it is uncertain when or if the provisions in the AHCA will become law, or the extent to which any such changes may impact our business, it is clear that concrete steps are being taken to repeal and replace certain aspects of the ACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which resulted in reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken, as well as, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals and imaging centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. An expansion in government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower reimbursements for procedures using our products, reduce medical procedure volumes, and adversely affect our business and results of operations, possibly materially.
 We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover and provide adequate payment for the procedures using our products. In addition, it is possible that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will adversely affect the demand for procedures using our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a significant adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 162 employees in the U.S., approximately 140 of which were based in our Carlsbad, California headquarters, covering all of the following functional areas: sales, customer service, marketing, clinical education, advanced manufacturing, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, research and development, human resources, finance, legal, information technology and administration. We have never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believe that our relations with our employees are good. We currently have no employees working under collective bargaining agreements.  On February 1, 2017, we implemented a workforce reduction, aimed at further aligning our employee count and operating expense with our current revenues.  As of March 21, 2017, we have 142 employees, all located within the U.S., of which 119 are based in our Carlsbad, California headquarters.
