ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
We began operations in 1988, under the ownership and control of Ardell Mees, who provided installation services to grocery decor design companies. As our reputation for excellent workmanship has grown, we have expanded our operations to serve a larger geographic region. On January 4, 2001, we incorporated in North Dakota as ADM Enterprises, Inc. On May 9, 2006, the Company changed both its name to ADM Endeavors and its domicile to the state of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC, a sole proprietorship owned by Ardell and Tammera Mees, in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Company. Even though the Company was incorporated on January 4, 2001, it had no operations until the share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises, LLC on July 1, 2008. All business operations are those solely of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary ADM Enterprises, LLC.
 
In May of 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in its authorized share capital. The authorized common stock increased to 800,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share and preferred stock increased to 80,000,000 at a par value of $0.001 per share.

We provide customized construction and installation of grocery store decor for both new and renovated grocery stores. Our service and expertise include the installation of grocery checkout stands, grid ceilings, cart-stops, shelving, customer service counter, office cabinetry and other grocery store equipment and fixtures. Our clients primarily consist of design companies, most of whom are subsidiaries of major retail grocery chains, or are affiliated with Associated Wholesale Grocers, the nation’s second largest retailer-owned grocery wholesaler. We believe that our success is the result of both our quality installation of grocery equipment and fixtures, and high level of personal service that we provide to our customers. We receive bid requests from all regions of the United States. Therefore, we are seeking to expand our operations to service additional geographic areas.
 
The majority of our contracts have been in the Midwestern United States including North Dakota, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Over the past 25 years, ADM has completed projects in 25 states, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Illinois, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, California, Nevada, and Florida.

The main focus of our expansion plan includes primarily the Midwestern United States including the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas, as well as some southern states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Kansas.
 
To effectuate our business plan during the next twelve months, we must increase our current customer base, as well as acquire additional employees and equipment so that we may accommodate our expanded customer base. We anticipate that we will establish an online presence to increase our market visibility and corporate recognition. We believe we can establish our industry presence and stimulate interest by constructing a trade show booth to market our services when we attend annual grocer tradeshows and conventions.
 
Use of Grocery Decor Installation Services in the Construction and Remodeling Industry has grown tremendously in recent years. The retail grocery industry is highly competitive and requires constant innovations to attract and retain customers. Accordingly, neighborhood markets battle for patrons by catering to customers’ desires for a modern, clean, and convenient shopping experience. Grocery stores, therefore, typically renovate every five to six years to maintain a new image.
 
In the past, store workers, painters or carpenters installed decor items. However, as the designs and materials became increasingly elaborate, the need for specialized and experienced installers grew. The installation process requires that an installer have special knowledge of various aspects of construction, including framing, finishing, and remodeling. Additionally, knowledge of standards for product usage, hanging methods and quality control are extremely helpful. As a result of the frequency of store renovations, coupled with the complexity of the items being installed secures the demand for custom installation services.
