Item 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
CytRx Corporation (“CytRx”) is a biopharmaceutical research and development company specializing in oncology and rare diseases. The Company’s focus has been on the discovery, research and clinical development of novel anti-cancer drug candidates that employ novel linker technologies to enhance the accumulation and release of cytotoxic anti-cancer agents at the tumor. During 2017, CytRx’s discovery laboratory, located in Freiburg, Germany, synthesized and tested over 75 rationally designed drug conjugates with highly potent payloads, culminating in the creation of two distinct classes of compounds. Four lead candidates (LADR-7 through LADR-10) were selected based on in vitro and animal preclinical studies, stability, and manufacturing feasibility. In 2018, additional animal efficacy and toxicology testing of these lead candidates was conducted. In addition, a novel albumin companion diagnostic, ACDx™, was developed to identify patients with cancer who are most likely to benefit from treatment with these drug candidates.
 
On June 1, 2018, CytRx launched Centurion BioPharma Corporation (“Centurion”), a private subsidiary, and transferred all of its assets, liabilities and personnel associated with the laboratory operations in Freiburg, Germany. In connection with said transfer, the Company and Centurion entered into a Management Services Agreement whereby the Company agreed to render advisory, consulting, financial and administrative services to Centurion, for which Centurion shall reimburse the Company for the cost of such services plus a 5% service charge. The Management Services Agreement may be terminated by either party at any time. Centurion is focused on the development of personalized medicine for solid tumor treatment. On December 21, 2018, CytRx announced that Centurion had concluded the pre-clinical phase of development for its four LADR™ drug candidates, and for its albumin companion diagnostic (ACDx™). As a result of completing this work, operations taking place at the pre-clinical laboratory in Freiburg, Germany would no longer be needed and, accordingly, the lab was closed at the end of January 2019.
 
We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1985. Our corporate offices are located at 11726 San Vicente Boulevard, Suite 650, Los Angeles, California 90049, and our telephone number is (310) 826-5648. Our web site is located at http://www.cytrx.com. We do not incorporate by reference into this Annual Report the information on, or accessible through, our website, and you should not consider it as part of this Annual Report.
 
LADR Drug Discovery Platform and Centurion
 
Centurion’s LADR™ (Linker Activated Drug Release) technology platform is a discovery engine combining our expertise in linker chemistry and albumin biology to create a pipeline of anti-cancer molecules that will avoid unacceptable systemic toxicity while delivering highly potent agents directly to the tumor. They have created a “toolbox” of linker technologies that have the ability to significantly increase the therapeutic index of ultra-high potency drugs (10-1,000 times more potent than traditional cytotoxins) by controlling the release of the drug payloads and improving drug-like properties.
 
Centurion’s efforts were focused on two classes of ultra-high potency albumin-binding drug conjugates. These drug conjugates combine the proprietary LADR™ linkers with novel derivatives of the auristatin and maytansinoid drug classes. These payloads historically have required a targeting antibody for successful administration to humans. These drug conjugates eliminate the need for a targeting antibody and provide a small molecule therapeutic option with potential broader applicability.
 
Centurion’s postulated mechanism of action for the albumin-binding drug conjugates is as follows:
 

● | after administration, the linker portion of the drug conjugate forms a rapid and specific covalent bond to the cysteine-34 position of circulating albumin; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | circulating albumin preferentially accumulates at the tumors, bypassing concentration in other non-tumor sites, including the heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract due to a mechanism called “Enhanced Permeability and Retention”; 
● | once localized at the tumor, the acid-sensitive linker is cleaved due to the specific conditions within the tumor and in the tumor microenvironment; and 
● | free active drug is then released into the tumor.

Centurion’s novel companion diagnostic, ACDx™ (albumin companion diagnostic), was developed to identify patients with cancer who are most likely to benefit from treatment with the four LADR lead assets.
 
CytRx and Centurion have been working on identifying partnership opportunities for LADR™ ultra-high potency drug conjugates and its albumin companion diagnostic. However, no partnerships or any source of financing has become available after two years of effort.
 
Business Strategy for LADR™ Platform
 
Currently, the Company continues to work on identifying partnership or financing opportunities for LADR™ ultra-high potency drug conjugates and their albumin companion diagnostic. We have concluded all research and development on LADR and its companion diagnostic and continue to focus on identifying partnership or financing opportunities.
 
Aldoxorubicin
 
Until July 2017, we were concentrating on the research and clinical development of aldoxorubicin, our modified version of the widely used cytotoxin agent, doxorubicin. Aldoxorubicin combines the agent doxorubicin with a novel linker-molecule that binds specifically to albumin in the blood to allow for delivery of higher amounts of doxorubicin (3½ to 4 times) without several of the major dose-limiting toxicities seen with administration of doxorubicin alone.
 
On July 27, 2017, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license with ImmunityBio, Inc. (formerly known as NantCell, Inc. (“ImmunityBio”)), granting to ImmunityBio the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize aldoxorubicin in all indications. As a result, the Company is no longer working on development of aldoxorubicin (ImmunityBio has recently merged with NantKwest, Inc.). As part of the license, ImmunityBio made a strategic investment of $13 million in CytRx common stock at $6.60 per share, a premium of 92% to the market price on that date. We also issued ImmunityBio a warrant to purchase up to 500,000 shares of common stock at $6.60, which expired on January 26, 2019. We are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $343 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon achievement of certain regulatory approvals and commercial milestones. We are also entitled to receive ascending double-digit royalties for net sales for soft tissue sarcomas and mid to high single digit royalties for other indications. There can be no assurance that ImmunityBio will achieve such milestones, approvals or sales with respect to aldoxorubicin. ImmunityBio has initiated a Phase 2, randomized, two-cohort, open-label registrational-intent study for first-line and second-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, which includes aldoxorubicin.
 
Aldoxorubicin is a conjugate of the commonly prescribed cytotoxin agent doxorubicin that binds to circulating albumin in the bloodstream and is believed to concentrate the drug at the site of the tumor. Aldoxorubicin, has been tested in over 600 patients with various types of cancer. Specifically, it is comprised of (6-maleimidocaproyl) hydrazine, an acid-sensitive molecule that is conjugated to doxorubicin. The initial indication for aldoxorubicin is for patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS). ImmunityBio lists a randomized Phase 2 and a randomized Phase 3 study, as well as an aldoxorubicin and ifosfamide Phase 1/2 study in its solid tumor platform and is currently reviewing options in STS.
 
Aldoxorubicin has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of STS. ODD provides several benefits including seven years of market exclusivity after approval, certain R&D related tax credits, and protocol assistance by the FDA. European regulators granted aldoxorubicin Orphan designation for STS which confers ten years of market exclusivity among other benefits.

In addition to STS, ImmunityBio has expanded aldoxorubicin’s use by combining it with immunotherapies and cell-based treatments and is currently in late-stage clinical development in advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer, in glioblastoma, and in triple negative breast cancer. ImmunityBio has initiated a phase 2 registrational-intent study in metastatic pancreatic cancer.
 
Molecular Chaperone Assets (Orphayzme)
 
In 2011, CytRx sold the rights to arimoclomol and iroxanadine, based on molecular chaperone regulation technology, to Orphazyme A/S (formerly Orphazyme ApS) in exchange for a one-time, upfront payment and the right to receive up to a total of $120 million (USD) in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain pre-specified regulatory and business milestones, as well as royalty payments based on a specified percentage of any net sales of products derived from arimoclomol. Orphazyme is testing arimoclomol in four indications, including Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NPC), Gaucher disease, Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Orphazyme has announced it expects read-outs for its registrational trials in IBM and ALS in the first half of 2021. Orphazyme has highlighted positive Phase 2/3 clinical trial data in patients with NPC and have submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is currently under Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) with a target action date of June 17, 2021. It also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). They have established an Early Access Program in the U.S. as well as other select European countries. Orphazyme has also received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for arimoclomol for NPC. Orphayzme recently announced its intention that arimoclomol will be marketed globally under the tradename MIPLYFFA™. CytRx will be entitled to a milestone payment of $6 million upon FDA approval, $4 million upon EMA approval and $2 million upon approval in Japan, with royalties from potential sales and potential additional milestone payments, although there can be no assurances that such milestones will be achieved.
Innovive Acquisition Agreement
 
On September 19, 2008, we completed our merger acquisition of Innovive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Innovive, and its clinical-stage cancer product candidates, including aldoxorubicin and tamibarotene. Under the merger agreement by which we acquired Innovive, we agreed to pay the former Innovive stockholders up to approximately $18.3 million of future earnout merger consideration, subject to our achievement of specified net sales under the Innovive license agreements. The earnout merger consideration, if any, will be payable in shares of our common stock, subject to specified conditions, or, at our election, in cash or by a combination of shares of our common stock and cash. Our common stock will be valued for purposes of any future earnout merger consideration based upon the trading price of our common stock at the time the earnout merger consideration is paid. The earnout will be accrued if and when earned. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 no amounts were due under this Agreement.
Research and Development
 
Expenditures for research and development activities related to continuing operations were $0.8 million in 2020 and $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or approximately 12% and 5%, respectively, of our total expenses. For further information regarding our research and development activities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below.
Commercialization and Marketing
 
We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities or experience in marketing products.
 
We are searching for a development and commercialization partner or a financing for our LADR drug candidates and do not currently plan on commercializing them ourselves. Over the past two years, we have been unable to attract a development and commercial partner nor a financing for this endeavor; however we are continuing to pursue all possibilities.

Patents and Proprietary Technology
 
We actively seek patent protection for our technologies, processes, uses, and ongoing improvements and consider our patents and other intellectual property to be critical to our business. We regularly evaluate the patentability of new inventions and improvements developed by us or our collaborators, and, whenever appropriate, will endeavor to file U.S. and international patent applications to protect these new inventions and improvements. We cannot be certain that any of the current pending patent applications we have filed or licensed, or any new patent applications we may file or license, will ever be issued in the U.S. or any other country. There also is no assurance that any issued patents will be effective to prevent others from using our products or processes. It is also possible that any patents issued to us, as well as those we have licensed or may license in the future, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or third parties could obtain patents that we would need to either license or to design around, which we may be unable to do. Current and future competitors may have licensed or filed patent applications or received patents and may acquire additional patents and proprietary rights relating to compounds, products or processes that may be competitive with ours.
 
In addition to patent protection, we attempt to protect our proprietary products, processes and other information by relying on trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and certain other persons who have access to such products, processes and information. Under the agreements, all inventions conceived by employees are our exclusive property, but there is no assurance that these agreements will afford significant protection against misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets and confidential information.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we have three pending U.S. patent applications and forty-one pending foreign patent applications covering our LADRTM-related technology including LADR-7, LADR-8, LADR-9 and LADR-10. The un-extended patent term of patents that issue covering our LADRTM-related technology is between June 2036 and November 2038. We also have one pending international patent application covering our albumin companion diagnostic (ACDxTM). The un-extended patent term of patents that issue covering our ACDxTM is July 2039. The patents and patent applications covering our LADRTM-related technology, and ACDxTM are assigned to Centurion BioPharma Corporation. In conjunction with our July 27, 2017 ImmunityBio licensing agreement, we granted ImmunityBio an exclusive license to all our aldoxorubicin-related patents, including the rights in three granted U.S. patents, nine granted foreign patents, one pending U.S. patent applications, and ten pending foreign patent applications covering aldoxorubicin and related technologies. Our intellectual property holdings relating to aldoxorubicin and related technologies include an exclusive license from Vergell Medical, S.A. or Vergell, to U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Patents and applications that cover pharmaceutical compositions comprising aldoxorubicin and their use in treating cancer (including glioblastoma) have un-extended patent terms expiring between March 2021 and June 2034.
 
LICENSE AGREEMENTS
 
Aldoxorubicin
 
We are the licensee of patent rights held by KTB for the worldwide development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin under a license agreement dated April 17, 2006. In February 2017, we received notice that KTB had transferred and assigned its rights and obligations under the license to Vergell Medical, S.A. The license is exclusive and applies to all products that may be subject to the licensed intellectual property in all fields of use. We may sublicense the intellectual property in our sole discretion. Pursuant to an amendment to the license agreement entered into in March 2014, we also have a non-exclusive worldwide license to any additional technology that is claimed or disclosed in the licensed patents and patent applications for use in the field of oncology.
 
Under the agreement, we must make payments to Vergell in the aggregate of up to $7.5 million upon meeting clinical and regulatory milestones, and up to and including the product’s second final marketing approval. We also agreed to pay:
 

● | commercially reasonable royalties based on a percentage of net sales (as defined in the agreement); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a percentage of any non-royalty sub-licensing income (as defined in the agreement); and 
● | milestones of $1 million for each additional final marketing approval that we obtain. 

 
In the event that we must pay a third party in order to exercise our rights to the intellectual property under the agreement, we are entitled to deduct a percentage of those payments from the royalties due Vergell, up to an agreed upon cap.
 
Under the agreement with Vergell, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the research and development activities we determine are necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market aldoxorubicin in those countries that we determine are commercially feasible. Under the agreement, Vergell is to use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide us with access to suppliers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of aldoxorubicin, on the same terms and conditions as may be provided to Vergell by those suppliers.

The agreement will expire on a product-by-product basis upon the expiration of the subject patent rights. We have the right to terminate the agreement on 30 days’ notice, provided we pay a cash penalty to Vergell. Vergell may terminate the agreement if we are in breach and the breach is not cured within a specified cure period, or if we fail to use diligent and commercial efforts to meet specified clinical milestones.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our LADR™ technology platform and ultra-high potency albumin-bind drug conjugates provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, marketing and human resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
 
There are many companies developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) for the treatment of cancer and some that use the same classes of cytotoxic payloads as we are currently using. These include Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Seattle Genetics Inc. who market Adcetris®, and F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd./Genentech who market Kadcyla®. According to www.clinicaltrials.gov, many other major pharmaceutical companies, including Celgene and GlaxoSmithKline are testing an ADC in either on-going or currently enrolling clinical trials. Other companies have created or have programs to create cell-killing agents for attachment to antibodies or other targeting agents. These companies may compete with us for technology out-license arrangements.
 
In addition to ADCs, we face competition from other nanomedicine platforms developing targeted therapies, including platforms focused on nanoparticles and liposomes. Non-ADC therapies may be in development for the cancer types we or our partners elect to pursue. Further, these companies may also compete with us for technology out-license arrangements.
 
Continuing development of conventional and targeted cytotoxins by large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies may result in new compounds that may compete with our product candidates. More recently, immuno-oncology therapies that stimulate the body’s own defense system to attack cancers are being developed by certain of these companies and some have been approved for use as cancer therapeutics. In the future, immuno-oncology agents including cell therapies, targeted therapies or cytotoxic treatments may compete with our product candidates. Other companies have created or have programs to create potent cell-killing agents for attachment to tumor targeting agents. These companies may compete with us for technology out-license arrangements.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our drug candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
 
Many companies, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms with financial resources, research and development staffs, and facilities that may be substantially greater than those of ours or our strategic partners or licensees, are engaged in the research and development of pharmaceutical products that could compete with our potential products. To the extent that we seek to acquire, through license or otherwise, existing or potential new products, we will be competing with numerous other companies, many of which will have substantially greater financial resources, large acquisition and research and development staffs that may give those companies a competitive advantage over us in identifying and evaluating these drug acquisition opportunities. Any products that we acquire will be competing with products marketed by companies that in many cases will have substantially greater marketing resources than we have. The industry is characterized by rapid technological advances and competitors may develop their products more rapidly and such products may be more effective than those currently under development or that may be developed in the future by our strategic partners or licensees. Competitive products for a number of the disease indications that we have targeted are currently being marketed by other parties, and additional competitive products are under development and may also include products currently under development that we are not aware of or products that may be developed in the future.

Government Regulation
 
The U.S. and other developed countries extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of drugs and biologic products. The FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, regulates pharmaceutical and biologic products.
 
To obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting safety and efficacy for the intended indication as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this will require extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. The collection of these data, as well as the preparation of applications for review by the FDA involve significant time and expense. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and efficacy of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the therapeutic claims and commercial applications of these products. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems at any time following initial marketing of our products.
 
The first stage of the FDA approval process for a new drug involves completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the results of these studies to the FDA. These data, together with proposed clinical protocols, manufacturing information, analytical data and other information submitted to the FDA, in an investigational new drug application, or IND, must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. Preclinical studies generally involve FDA regulated laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety of the product candidate.
 
After the IND becomes effective, a company may commence human clinical trials. These are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials consist of testing of the product candidate in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 2 trials, in addition to safety, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at multiple test sites. A company must submit to the FDA a clinical protocol, accompanied by the approval of the Institutional Review Boards at the institutions participating in the trial, prior to commencement of each clinical trial.
 
To obtain FDA marketing authorization, a company must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, in the form of a new drug application, or NDA.
 
The amount of time taken by the FDA for approval of an NDA will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the product candidate has received priority review, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question, and the workload at the FDA.
 
The FDA may, in some cases, confer upon an investigational product the status of a fast-track product. A fast-track product is defined as a new drug or biologic intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition. The FDA can base approval of an NDA for a fast-track product on an effect on a surrogate endpoint, or on another endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. If a preliminary review of clinical data suggests that a fast-track product may be effective, the FDA may initiate review of entire sections of a marketing application for a fast-track product before the sponsor completes the application.
 
We anticipate that our products will be manufactured by our strategic partners, licensees or other third parties. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with the FDA’s cGMP, which are regulations that govern the manufacture, holding and distribution of a product. Our manufacturers also will be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Nuclear Energy and Radiation Control Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Following approval, the FDA periodically inspects drug and biologic manufacturing facilities to ensure continued compliance with the good manufacturing practices regulations. Our manufacturers will have to continue to comply with those requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product. Adverse patient experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or market removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.

The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and direct-to-consumer advertising. We also will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. In addition, we will be subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of product approvals, seize or recall products, and deny or withdraw approvals.
 
We will also be subject to a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and sales of our products outside the U.S. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries and regions must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from one regulatory authority to another and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In the European Union, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar, in principle, to those in the U.S.
