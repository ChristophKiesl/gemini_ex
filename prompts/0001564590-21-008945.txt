Item 1. Business
Description of Business
 TPI Composites, Inc. is the holding company that conducts substantially all of its business operations through its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the Company or we). The Company was founded in 1968 and has been producing composite wind blades since 2001. The Company’s knowledge and experience of composite materials and manufacturing originates with its predecessor company, Tillotson Pearson Inc., a leading manufacturer of high-performance sail and powerboats along with a wide range of composite structures used in other industrial applications. Following the separation from the boat building business in 2004, the Company reorganized in Delaware as LCSI Holding, Inc. and then changed its corporate name to TPI Composites, Inc. in 2008.
Overview
 We are the only independent manufacturer of composite wind blades for the wind energy market with a global manufacturing footprint. We enable many of the industry’s leading wind turbine original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to outsource the manufacturing of some of their wind blades through our global footprint of advanced manufacturing facilities strategically located to serve large and growing wind markets in a cost-effective manner. Given the importance of wind energy capture, turbine reliability and cost to power producers, the size, quality and performance of wind blades is highly strategic to our OEM customers. As a result, we have become a key supplier to our OEM customers in the manufacture of wind blades and related precision molding and assembly systems. We have entered into long-term supply agreements pursuant to which we dedicate capacity at our facilities to our customers in exchange for their commitment to purchase minimum annual volumes of wind blade sets (which consist of three wind blades). This collaborative dedicated supplier model provides us with contracted volumes that generate significant revenue visibility, drive capital efficiency and allow us to produce wind blades at a lower total delivered cost, while ensuring critical dedicated capacity for our customers. 
 
We also provide field service inspection and repair services to our OEM customers and wind farm owners and operators.  Our field service inspection and repairs services include diagnostic, repair and maintenance service offerings for wind blades that have been installed on wind turbines located at wind farms. Our field service inspection and repair services can be performed up-tower, where a blade technician performs these services in the air or from the wind turbine tower on a wind turbine blade, or down tower, where a blade is first removed from a wind turbine and these services are performed on the ground at the wind farm site or in a repair facility.
 
We also leverage our advanced composite technology and history of innovation to supply high strength, lightweight and durable composite products to the transportation market.  In November 2017, we signed a five- year supply agreement with Proterra Inc. (Proterra) to supply Proterra Catalyst® composite bus bodies. In February 2018, we entered into an agreement with Navistar, Inc. (Navistar) to design and develop an all composite Class 8 tractor cab. This collaborative development project was entered into in connection with Navistar’s award under the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Super Truck II investment program, which is designed to promote fuel efficiency in commercial vehicles. In 2019, we also agreed to develop prototype composite body delivery vehicles for Workhorse Group. In 2019, we made a capital investment of approximately $11.5 million to develop a highly automated manufacturing line for the electric vehicle market within our Warren, Rhode Island facility, and we are currently in the process of commissioning this line. We expect this investment will enable us to further develop our technology, create defensible product and process intellectual property (IP) and demonstrate our capability to manufacture composite components cost effectively at automotive volume rates. We also expect this automated manufacturing line will also help our current and potential customers to de-risk the decision-making process to commit to TPI for high-volume manufacturing programs in the future. 
 Our wind blade and precision molding and assembly systems manufacturing businesses accounted for approximately 96%, 96%, and 95% of our total net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of February 24, 2021, our long-term wind and transportation supply agreements provide for minimum aggregate volume commitments from our customers of approximately $2.8 billion and encourage our 
 3

customers to purchase additional volume up to, in the aggregate, a total contract value of approximately $4.6 billion through the end of 2024.

 Business Strategy
 Our long-term success will be driven by our business strategy. The key elements of our business strategy are as follows:
  
• | Capitalize on the long-term, global trends of decarbonization of the electric sector and the electrification of vehicles. We believe we are well-positioned to participate and benefit from the continued global growth of renewable energy, and in particular, wind energy. Global demand for renewable energy has increased significantly in recent years and we expect that this trend will continue and potentially accelerate in the coming years due to a multitude of factors, including: increased cost competitiveness of wind energy compared to fossil fuel generated electricity; increased demand from corporations and utility providers for renewable energy; recent international policy initiatives designed to promote the growth of renewable energy; and the Biden administration’s proposed plans to promote renewable energy growth in the United States. We believe our global footprint of manufacturing facilities will allow us to capitalize on the continued global growth of wind energy in the coming years. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Similarly, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the projected growth of electric vehicles. As the global vehicle electrification trend continues, reducing the weight of these vehicles is critical to expanding range and/or providing more room for additional batteries or reducing the number of batteries. We believe vehicle manufacturers and vehicle owners will also benefit from the lower cost of total ownership due to the durability and the non-corrosive properties of composites compared to metallic materials along with the ability to scale production with lower production investment costs. As a result, we expect there will be an increased demand for composites products for electric vehicles. In addition, we believe there is a potential demand in other strategic markets for composites as to replace aluminum or other more expensive composite materials such as carbon.

• | Grow our existing relationships and develop new relationships with leading industry OEMs. We plan to continue growing and expanding our relationships with existing customers who, according to data from BloombergNEF (Bloomberg), represented approximately 52% of the global onshore wind energy market, approximately 88% of that market excluding China, and 99% of the U.S. onshore wind turbine market over the three years ended December 31, 2019, based on megawatts (MWs) of energy capacity installed, as well as developing new relationships with other leading industry OEMs. We expect to be presented with opportunities to expand our existing relationships and develop new relationships with industry OEMs as they seek to capitalize on the benefits of outsourced wind blade manufacturing while maintaining high quality customization and dedicated capacity. In July 2020, General Electric International, Inc. and its affiliates (GE Wind) agreed to extend our existing supply agreement in one of our Mexico plants by two years to 2022, and our existing supply agreement in our Newton Iowa plant by one year through 2021 with an option to extend through 2022, and added one additional wind blade manufacturing line in Mexico to provide blades for GE Wind’s turbine technologies in North America. In July 2020, we entered into a supply agreement with Nordex SE (Nordex) for two additional manufacturing lines in our Chennai, India facility, where we plan to start production in the first quarter of 2021. In August 2020, we reached an agreement with Vestas to extend our supply agreement at one of our Izmir, Turkey plants by one year through 2022.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our footprint in large and growing wind markets, capitalize on the continuing outsourcing trend, evaluate building wind blades for the growing offshore wind market and evaluate strategic acquisitions. As the wind energy market continues to expand globally and many wind turbine OEMs continue to shift towards increased outsourcing of wind blade manufacturing, we believe we are well-positioned with our global footprint. We utilize our strengths in composites technology and manufacturing, combined with our collaborative dedicated supplier model to provide our customers with an efficient solution for their expansion in large and growing onshore wind markets. We also are evaluating opportunities to manufacture wind blades for the growing offshore wind market. In addition, our demonstrated ability to enter into new markets and the strength of our manufacturing capabilities afford us the optionality to build new factories or grow through strategic acquisitions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to drive down costs of wind energy. We continue to work with our customers on larger size wind blade models that maximize the capture of wind energy and drive down the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). We also continue to utilize our advanced technology, regional manufacturing facilities strategically located to cost effectively serve large and growing wind markets and ability to source materials globally at competitive costs to deliver high-performing, composite wind blades. Our collaborative engineering approach and our advanced precision molding and assembly systems allow us to integrate our customer’s design requirements with cost-efficient, replicable and scalable manufacturing processes. This collaborative engineering approach with our customers also allows us to reduce manufacturing cycle times, new line and factory start up times and new blade model transition times. We also continue to work with our customers to drive down the cost of materials and production, the benefit of which we typically share with our customers contractually in a manner that reduces LCOE for customers, further strengthens our customer relationships and improves our margins.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our field service inspection and repair business. Although sales from our field service inspection and repair business currently represent a very small percentage of our total revenue, we plan to expand our field service inspection and repair business by leveraging our existing wind blade manufacturing and composites expertise and global footprint. We believe there is an increasing demand and growing market for experienced wind blade inspection and repair services worldwide as the number of wind turbines installed worldwide continues to grow and the fleet of existing wind turbines continues to age. We also expect that the operating margins at our field service inspection and repair business will be higher than the operating margins of our wind blade manufacturing business.

• | Focus on continuing innovation. We have a history of innovation in advanced composite technologies and production techniques and use several proprietary technologies related to wind blade manufacturing. With this culture of innovation and a collaborative “design for manufacturability” approach, we continue to address increasing physical dimensions, demanding technical specifications and strict quality control requirements for our customers’ most advanced wind blades. We also invest in ongoing simplification and selective automation of production processes for increased efficiency and precision. In addition, we plan to leverage our history of composite industry-first innovations to grow our business in the transportation market, in which we believe there is a demand for high precision, structural composites manufacturing as well as high speed, high volume manufacturing of structural composite components, particularly in the transportation market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wind Blade Manufacturing Operations and Process
 We have developed significant expertise in advanced composite technology and use high performance composite materials, precision molding and assembly systems including modular tooling, and advanced process technology, as well as sophisticated measurement, inspection, testing and quality assurance tools, allowing us to produce over 65,000 wind blades since 2001 with a strong, long-term field performance record in a market where reliability is critical to our customers’ success. We manufacture or have manufactured wind blades ranging from 30 meters to approximately 80 meters across our global facilities and have the capability to manufacture wind blades of greater lengths as required by existing or new customers. In combination with our advanced technologies, we seek to create manufacturing processes that are replicable and scalable in our manufacturing facilities located worldwide, regardless of cultural or language barriers. Using continuous improvement principles, we can customize each manufacturing step, from raw materials to finished products. This also allows us to systematically design for the entire manufacturing process so that we can achieve better quality control and increase production efficiencies. We believe that our focus on simplifying and, where feasible, automating production processes is critical to manufacturing high-precision, lightweight and durable products at a reasonable cost to our customers. We produce high unit volumes of near-aerospace grade products at industrial costs.
Raw Materials
 The key raw materials for the wind blades we manufacture include highly advanced fiberglass fabrics, select carbon reinforcements, foam, balsa wood, resin, adhesives for assembly of molded components, gel coat or paint for preparation of cosmetic surfaces and attachment hardware including steel components. Most of these materials are available in multiple geographic regions and in reasonably close proximity to our manufacturing facilities. Our agreements for the supply of raw materials are designed to guarantee volumes that we believe will be required to fulfill our customers’ wind blade commitments. A portion of our raw materials are subject to price volatility, such as the resins used in our manufacturing processes. Although the majority of materials incorporated into our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers. We seek multiple suppliers for our raw materials and continually evaluate potential new supplier relationships.
Precision Molding and Assembly Systems
 Over the last decade, we have produced hundreds of precision molding and assembly systems, ranging from 30 meters to approximately 80 meters in length, to support our global operations. We began these operations in our tooling technology center in Warren, Rhode Island. We also manufacture our precision molding and assembly systems production capabilities at a facility in Taicang Port, China, which serves customers around the globe. While capable of cost-effectively delivering precision molding and assembly systems across all of our facilities, our Rhode Island tooling technology center primarily serves the North American market. In 2020, we transitioned most of our North American precision molding and assembly system production capabilities from Warren, Rhode Island to a new facility in Juárez, Mexico, which can serve customers globally. Our precision molding and assembly systems have been used to build tens of thousands of wind blades worldwide.
 Our tooling solutions include precision wind blade patterns, precision molding and assembly systems, including modular tooling techniques. We believe that our technological and production expertise are key factors in 
 6

our continued competitiveness, as we address continually increasing physical dimensions, demanding technical specifications, and strict quality control requirements for wind blades.
 Wind Blade Production Process
 Production of wind blades requires adherence to the unique specifications of each of our customers, who design their wind turbines and wind blades to optimize performance, reliability and total delivered cost. With our culture of innovation and a collaborative “design for manufacturability” approach, we have the capability and expertise to manufacture wind blades of different designs, utilizing fiberglass, carbon or other advanced composite materials to meet unique customer specifications. We also have the flexibility to quickly transition our manufacturing facilities to produce different wind blade models and sizes using our precision molding and assembly systems, including modular tooling techniques.
 We have developed a highly dependable method for making high-quality wind blades. In conjunction with our continuous improvement principles, we design our proprietary manufacturing processes to be replicable, scalable and transferable to each of our advanced manufacturing facilities worldwide. As a result, we can repeatedly move a product from its design phase to volume production while maintaining quality, even in developing regions of the world. Similarly, we have developed the manual portions of our manufacturing processes based on proven technologies and production methods that can be learned and implemented rapidly by line personnel. We focus on consistency and quality control across our facilities, using hands-on training methods and employing repeatable manufacturing processes.
 We use an advanced form of vacuum-assisted resin transfer tooling process to pull liquid resin into a dry lay-up, resulting in light, strong, and reliable composite structures. In our manufacturing process, fiber reinforcements and core materials are laid up in a mold while dry, followed by a vacuum bag that is placed over the layup and sealed to the mold. The wind blade component is then placed under vacuum. The resin is introduced into the wind blade component via resin inlet ports and then distributed through the reinforcement and core materials via a flow medium and a series of channels, saturating the wind blade component. The vacuum removes air and gases during processing, thereby eliminating voids. Pressure differentials drive resin uniformly throughout the wind blade component, providing a consistent laminate. By using a variety of reinforcement and core materials, the structural characteristics of the wind blade can be highly engineered to suit the custom specifications of our customers. Although only occasionally required by our customers, we are also capable of employing additional composite fabrication processes, such as pre-impregnated laminates, in addition to our vacuum infusion process.
 Wind Blade Long-Term Supply Agreements
 Our current wind blade customers, which include Vestas, GE Wind, Nordex, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A. (Siemens Gamesa) and ENERCON GmbH (ENERCON), are some of the world’s largest wind turbine manufacturers. According to data from Bloomberg, our customers represented approximately 52% of the global onshore wind energy market, approximately 88% of that market excluding China, and 99% of the U.S. onshore wind turbine market over the three years ended December 31, 2019, based on MWs of energy capacity installed. In our collaborative dedicated supplier model, our customers are incentivized to maximize the volume of wind blades purchased through lower pricing at higher purchase volumes. As of February 24, 2021, our existing wind blade supply agreements provide for minimum aggregate volume commitments from our customers of approximately $2.8 billion and encourage our customers to purchase additional volume up to, in the aggregate, a total contract value of approximately $4.6 billion through the end of 2024, which we believe provides us with significant future revenue visibility and helps to insulate us from potential short-term fluctuations or legislative changes in any one market. Our supply agreements generally contain liquidated damages provisions in the event of late delivery, however, we generally do not bear the responsibility for transporting the wind blades we manufacture to our customers.
 Our long-term supply agreements with our customers generally encourage our customers to maximize the volume of wind blades they purchase from us, since purchasing less than a specified amount typically triggers higher pricing, as well as provide downside protection for us through minimum annual volume commitments. Some of our long-term supply agreements also provide for annual sales price reductions reflecting assumptions regarding increases in our manufacturing efficiency and productivity. We work to continue to drive down the cost of materials and production through innovation and global sourcing, a portion of the benefit of which we share with our 
 7

customers contractually, further strengthening our deep customer relationships. Wind blade pricing is based on annual commitments of volume as established in the customer’s contract, with orders less than committed volume resulting in additional costs per wind blade to customers. Orders in excess of annual commitments may but generally do not result in discounts to customers from the contracted price for the committed volume. Customers may utilize early payment discounts, which are reported as a reduction of revenue at the time the discount is taken.
Vestas 
 In 2014, we entered into a new supply agreement with Vestas to supply wind blades from a manufacturing facility in Dafeng, China. Based on the success of this manufacturing arrangement, we expanded our relationship with Vestas through additional supply agreements to manufacture wind blades at our manufacturing facilities in Turkey, Matamoros, Mexico and Yangzhou, China. Additionally, in 2018, we entered into a supply agreement with Vestas to supply wind blades from a new manufacturing facility that was built in Chennai, India and we commenced operations at this facility in the first quarter of 2020. In August 2020, we reached an agreement with Vestas to extend our supply agreement at our Turkey facility by one year through 2022. Each of the supply agreements with Vestas provide for a minimum number of wind blade sets to be purchased by Vestas each year during the term, the schedule for which is established at the outset of the agreement. In return, we commit to dedicate a specific number of manufacturing lines to Vestas for each of the years under the supply agreements. Additionally, we create some of the model-specific tooling for Vestas. If either party commits a material breach of the supply agreement, the non-breaching party may terminate the supply agreement if the breach is not remedied or if the parties have not mutually agreed to plan for cure within 30 days after notice of breach has been given.  
 GE Wind 
 We have entered into multiple supply agreements with GE Wind to manufacture wind blades from two manufacturing facilities in Juárez, Mexico and our Newton, Iowa manufacturing facility. Each of the supply agreements with GE Wind provide for a minimum number of wind blade sets to be purchased by GE Wind each year during the term, the schedule for which is established at the outset of the agreement. In return, we commit to dedicate a specific number of manufacturing lines to GE Wind for each of the years under the supply agreements. In August 2018, GE Wind agreed to extend our existing supply agreement for one of our Mexico manufacturing facilities by two years to 2022 and increased the number of wind blade manufacturing lines in that facility from three to five. In addition, GE Wind agreed to transition to a larger blade model in our Newton, Iowa plant in early 2019 and to eliminate its option to terminate its supply agreement at this location prior to its December 2020 expiration. In July 2020, GE Wind agreed to extend our existing supply agreement in one of our Mexico plants by two years to 2022 and our existing supply agreement in our Newton Iowa plant by one year to 2021 with an option to extend through 2022 and added one additional wind blade manufacturing line in Mexico to provide blades for GE Wind’s turbine technologies in North America in 2021. Unless otherwise terminated or renewed, our supply agreements with GE Wind are in effect until the end of 2021 for our Iowa facility and until the end of 2022 for our two Mexico facilities. In addition, either party may terminate these supply agreements upon a material breach by the other party which goes uncured for 30 days after written notice has been provided. 
 Other Long-Term Supply Agreements
 We have entered into other long-term supply agreements in China, Mexico, Turkey and India with Nordex, Siemens Gamesa and ENERCON. With respect to these supply agreements, we agree to dedicate capacity for a set number of wind blades for each calendar year during the term of the agreement in exchange for commitments to purchase minimum annual volumes of wind blade sets. Unless otherwise terminated, these supply agreements generally remain in effect for a period of five years and either party may terminate their respective supply agreements upon a material breach by the other party which goes uncured. Some of these supply agreements contain provisions that allow for our customers to purchase less volume in later years of these supply agreements, reduce the number of dedicated manufacturing lines or to terminate the supply agreement upon notice for reasons such as our failure to deliver the contracted wind blade volumes or our failure to meet certain mutually agreed upon cost reduction targets. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Wind Blade Business— Some of our long-term supply agreements with our customers are subject to early termination and volume reductions at the discretion of our customers,  and any early termination of or reduced volumes of wind blades purchased under these agreements

would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Research and Development
 We have a long history of developing composite products as well as the development of new and advanced materials, tooling, manufacturing processes and inspection methods. Our knowledge and experience of composite materials and manufacturing originates with our predecessor company, Tillotson Pearson Inc., a leading manufacturer of high-performance recreational sail and powerboats along with a wide range of composite structures used in other industrial applications. Leveraging our knowledge and experience, we realized the opportunity to specialize in wind energy and other industrial end-markets where there was a demand for high precision composite manufacturing capabilities.
 
We conduct research and development in close collaboration with our customers on the design, development and deployment of innovative manufacturing processes, including automation, advanced materials and sophisticated product quality inspection tools. We have partnered with the U.S. DOE, government laboratories, universities and our customers to innovate through cost sharing Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Initiative programs. In 2021, we will be collaborating with the University of Maine pursuant to a grant from the U.S. DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to develop a rapid, low-cost additive manufacturing solution (3D printing) for fabricating large, segmented wind blade molds. In February 2018, we entered into an agreement with Navistar to design and develop an all composite Class 8 tractor cab. This collaborative development project was entered into in connection with Navistar’s recent award under the DOE’s Super Truck II investment program, which is designed to promote fuel efficiency in commercial vehicles.  We believe incorporating composite materials into a Class 8 tractor cab offers multiple potential performance and efficiency advantages compared to traditional metals in terms of weight savings, reduced part counts, and non-corrosion. In the first quarter of 2019, we executed a joint development agreement with GE Wind to cooperatively develop advanced blade technology for future wind turbines. 
 
We employ a highly experienced workforce of engineers in various facets of our business, from research and development projects, to the ongoing, real-time development and implementation of incremental manufacturing and material improvements. Our research and development effort places a priority on improving quality through process and procedure improvement, in addition to reducing cost through specification changes and sourcing of more cost-effective suppliers. Other areas of emphasis include composite design, in-house fabrication of precision molding and assembly systems, prototyping, testing, optimization and volume production capabilities. We also encourage our employees to invent and develop new technologies to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace. In addition to our internal research and development activities, from time to time, we also conduct research and development activities pursuant to funded development arrangements with our customers and other third parties, and intend to continue to seek opportunities for product development programs that could create recurring revenue and increase our overall profitability over the long term.
 
In July 2019, we acquired certain intellectual property and hired a team of engineering resources from the EUROS group, based in Berlin, Germany. This team of technical experts focuses on blade design, tooling, materials and process technology development, strengthened our technical capabilities in support of our global operations and growth. In addition, we established an advanced engineering center in Kolding, Denmark which provides technical and engineering resources to our manufacturing facilities and our customers.

Competition
 The wind blade market is highly concentrated, competitive and subject to evolving customer needs and expectations. In 2017, GE Wind, our largest customer at the time, completed its acquisition of LM Wind Power (LM), our largest competitor. We also compete primarily with other independent wind blade manufacturers such as Sinoma Science & Technology Co. Ltd., Shanghai Aeolon Wind Energy Technology Development (Group) Co., Ltd., Aeris Industria E Comercio De Equipamentos Para Geracao De Energia S.A. and ZhongFu Lianzhong Composites Group Co., Ltd., as well as regional wind blade suppliers in geographic areas where our current or prospective manufacturing facilities are located. 
 We also compete with, and in a number of cases supplement, vertically integrated wind turbine OEMs that manufacture their wind blades. We believe that a number of other established companies are manufacturing wind blades that will compete directly with our offerings, and some of our competitors noted above, may have significant financial and institutional resources.
 The principal competitive factors in the wind blade market include reliability, total delivered cost, manufacturing capability, product quality, engineering capability and timely completion of wind blades. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the foregoing factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of manufacturing capability, timely completion and product quality.
 Transportation Products
 We seek to create additional recurring revenue opportunities through the supply of other composite structures outside the wind energy market. We believe transportation products, including buses, trucks, electric vehicles and high-performance automotive products, are ideally suited for our advanced composite technology because of the benefits derived from weight reduction, corrosion resistance, strength and durability. These benefits should allow us to develop structural composite solutions to assist our customers in developing electric vehicles, including light, medium and heavy-duty trucks, buses and automobiles with clean propulsion systems or in meeting new and developing fuel economy standards. 
 In addition, by producing a range of composite structures, we are able to leverage the materials and manufacturing process technology and expertise developed through one project to maximize production quality, improve performance and minimize costs across our other manufacturing efforts, including our wind blade business. Our projects for customers in the transportation market have historically generated project-related revenues for a specific duration. We intend to seek collaborations with additional customers in these markets that will provide recurring revenue and business opportunities for us, in addition to the opportunities provided by our existing customers and relationships, and contribute to our overall profitability over the long term. 
 Our facilities in Warren, Rhode Island and Juárez, Mexico manufacture products for customers in the transportation market using a similar proprietary and replicable manufacturing processes that we use to produce wind blades. Our projects for customers in the transportation market include, or have included, the supply of all-composite bodies for electric buses and automated people mover systems for airports. We ceased manufacturing composite bus bodies from our Newton, Iowa facility in the first quarter of 2020. In 2019, we made a capital investment of approximately $11.5 million to develop a highly automated manufacturing line for the electric vehicle market within our Warren, Rhode Island facility, and we are currently in the process of commissioning this line. We expect this investment will enable us to further develop our technology, create defensible product and process IP and demonstrate our capability to manufacture composite components cost effectively at automotive volume rates.
 Our current principal competitors in the transportation market include suppliers of conventional steel and aluminum products and non-structural automotive fiberglass and other advanced composites-based manufacturers for transportation applications.
 10

Intellectual Property
 We have a variety of intellectual property rights, including patents issued, filed and applied-for in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, Germany, the European Union and China, trademarks and copyrights, but we believe that our continued success and competitive position depend, in large part, on our proprietary materials, tooling, process and inspection technologies and our ability to innovate. Accordingly, we take measures to protect the confidentiality and control the disclosure of our proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, know-how and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary rights and preserve our competitive position. We also seek to protect our proprietary technology, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our customers, employees, consultants and other contractors. Trade secrets, however, are difficult to protect. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our customers, employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Backlog
 As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our backlog for wind blades and related products totaled $1,197.7 million and $1,038.9 million, respectively. Our backlog includes purchase orders issued in connection with our long-term supply agreements. We generally record a purchase order into backlog when the following requirements have been met: a signed long-term supply agreement or other contractual agreement has been executed with our customer, a purchase order has been issued by our customer and we expect to ship wind blades to or produce the related products for such customer in satisfaction of any purchase order within 12 months. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenue for any future period. 
Regulation
 Wind Energy
 Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local regulations related to environmental protection, health and safety, labor relationships, general business practices and other matters. These regulations are administered by various foreign, federal, state and local environmental agencies and authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor and comparable agencies in China, Mexico, Turkey, India and individual U.S. states. In addition, our manufacturing operations in China, Mexico, Turkey and India are subject to those countries’ wage and price controls, currency exchange control regulations, investment and tax laws, laws restricting our ability to repatriate profits, trade restrictions and laws that may restrict foreign investment in certain industries. Some of these laws have only been recently adopted or are subject to further rulemaking or interpretation, and their impact on our operations, including the cost of complying with these laws, is uncertain. We believe that our operations currently comply, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations. Further, as a U.S. corporation, we are subject to The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business.
 In addition, our business has been and will continue to be affected by subsidization of the wind turbine industry with its influence declining over time as wind energy reaches grid parity with traditional sources of energy. In the United States, the federal government has encouraged capital investment in renewable energy primarily through tax incentives. Production tax credits for new renewable energy projects were first established in 1992. The Production Tax Credit for Renewable Energy (PTC) provided the owner of a wind turbine placed in operation before January 1, 2015 with a 10-year credit against its U.S. federal income tax obligations based on the amount of electricity generated by the wind turbine.
 
The PTC was extended in 2015 for wind power projects through December 31, 2019, and was to be phased down over the term of the PTC extension. Specifically, the PTC was kept at the same rate in effect at the end of 2014 for wind power projects that either commenced construction or met certain safe harbor requirements by the end of 2016, and thereafter was to be reduced by 20% per year in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. In December 2019, Congress extended the PTC through the end of 2020 and increased the rate from 40% to 60% for projects that either 
 11

commenced construction or met certain safe harbor requirements by the end of 2020 and are commissioned by the end of 2024.  In December 2020, Congress extended the PTC through the end of 2021, continuing the rate of 60% for projects that either commenced construction or met certain safe harbor requirements by the end of 2021 and are commissioned by the end of 2025.  In January 2021, the Biden administration announced several executive orders to promote renewable energy.
 At the state level, as of December 31, 2020, 30 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have implemented renewable portfolio standard (RPS) programs that generally require that, by a specified date, a certain percentage of a utility’s electricity supplied to consumers within such state is to be from renewable sources (ranging from 10% to 100% and from between the present and 2050).
 In addition, there are also increasing regulatory efforts globally to promote renewable power. In December 2020, the European Union (EU) agreed to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Similarly, in December 2020, China announced its goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, and in September 2019, India targeted to increase its renewable energy capacity to 450 gigawatts by 2030 and to 40% non-fossil fuel energy by 2030. Additionally, Turkey enacted Law No. 5346 in 2005, which was recently amended and extended in January 2021, to promote renewable-based electricity generation within their domestic electricity market through feed-in- tariffs and purchase obligations for distribution companies requiring purchases from certified renewable energy producers.
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed over 14,900 full-time employees, approximately 1,300 of whom were located in the United States, 2,000 in China, 6,000 in Mexico, 4,100 in Turkey and 1,500 in India. Certain of our employees in Turkey and at our manufacturing facility in Matamoros, Mexico are represented by a labor union. We believe that our relations with our employees are generally good.  
 Our human capital strategy focuses on creating an exceptional employee experience and ensuring that we foster a learning culture where our employees want to grow with us.  Our primary focus areas of our human capital strategy are as follows: 
 
Culture
 We believe our unique culture is a key strategic advantage for us.  Our associates are highly engaged and committed to the company, their teams, and the jobs they perform based on our most recent employee engagement surveys.  This strong employee engagement is due in part to a strong sense of purpose given our role in the broader renewable energy supply chain.  We believe strong employee engagement translates into a strong quality focus and orientation. It is through the efforts of our nearly 15,000 employees at year-end 2020 that we have been able to continue to achieve high levels of performance. When we select new persons to join our team, we ensure that the individuals have high levels of commitment and adaptability in addition to the skills needed for the role. Our employees embrace our core values of safety, operational excellence, commitment, integrity and leadership. Our team members bring our values to life by applying their diverse backgrounds and skillsets to the jobs they are performing, demonstrating high discretionary effort, and embracing our values in their day-to-day lives. 
Safety
  Safety is our most important and first core value. We strongly believe that all accidents are preventable and that every associate should return at the end of their shift to their families in the same healthy condition in which they showed up for work. To help drive these beliefs it is our goal to continuously improve our zero-harm culture and implement a global behavior-based safety program resulting in zero unsafe behaviors.  Our 13 manufacturing facilities have safety management systems in place that cover their associates and activities. We ensure the safety of our associates to support our zero-harm culture in a variety of ways, starting with safety education. Safety education is the foundation for our other safety measures. Associates receive regular training on environmental, health and safety (EHS) related topics. This training includes but is not limited to:

• | general awareness EHS training
--+-------------------------------

• | ergonomics training

• | fire hazard and prevention training
--+------------------------------------


• | hazardous material training
--+----------------------------


• | equipment-specific safety training
--+-----------------------------------


• | safety incident and corrective action training
--+-----------------------------------------------

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We value diversity in all forms, especially diversity of thought, and aspire to create an environment that recognizes and celebrates the benefits that come with a diverse workforce. We know that diversity of our employee population makes us better and strive to continue to improve and act with intention in these areas. 
 As a global business, we have an incredible opportunity to benefit from the diversity we have in our company. We can and will do more to maximize the positive impact that diversity, equity, inclusion, and a feeling of belonging can bring. We believe that this and the rest of our vision statement for diversity, equity and inclusion is a solid representation of what we believe in, are committed to, and how we will hold associates and leaders accountable. We recognize that one of our greatest areas of opportunity is to increase the representation of women and overall racial and ethnic diversity at all levels of leadership as we add more talent to our leadership levels.Talent
 We market open jobs across multiple platforms such as our website, LinkedIn, internal postings and local job boards to ensure that our candidate pool is as diverse as possible.  We promote having diversity on the interviewing and selection panel to ensure different points of view are considered as part of the final selection process.  We enjoy high levels of retention across all of our geographies.  Our overall turnover rate has continued to decline over the past three years on a global basis.  We facilitate an annual talent review process in all regions and functional teams to promote the internal development and promotion of internal talent.  We have enjoyed high participation in employee surveys, high engagement levels against industry normative data, and also facilitated a COVID and diversity equity and inclusion survey in 2020. 
Environmental, Health and Safety 
 We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate governing, among other things, health, safety, pollution and protection of the environment and natural resources, the handling and use of hazardous substances, the generation, storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, and the cleanup of any contaminated sites. We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. However, failure by us to comply with applicable environmental and other requirements could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims, remediation actions, and could negatively impact our reputation with customers. We have adopted environmental, health and safety policies outlining our commitment to environmental responsibility and accountability. These policies apply to the company as a whole, and our vendors and suppliers and are available on our website. We have a company-wide focus on safety and have implemented a number of measures to promote workplace safety. Customers are increasingly focused on safety records in their sourcing decisions due to increased regulations to report all incidents that occur at their sites and the costs associated with such incidents.
