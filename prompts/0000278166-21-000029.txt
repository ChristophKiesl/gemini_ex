ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Cavco Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on June 30, 2003, as a successor corporation to previous Cavco entities operating since 1965. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, we design and produce factory-built homes primarily distributed through a network of independent and Company-owned retailers, planned community operators and residential developers. We are one of the largest producers of manufactured homes in the United States, based on reported wholesale shipments, marketed under a variety of brand names including Cavco, Fleetwood, Palm Harbor, Fairmont, Friendship, Chariot Eagle and Destiny. We are also a leading producer of park model RVs, vacation cabins and factory-built commercial structures, as well as modular homes built primarily under the Nationwide Homes brand. Our finance subsidiary, CountryPlace Acceptance Corp. ("CountryPlace"), is an approved Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA" or "Fannie Mae") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC" or "Freddie Mac") seller/servicer, and a Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA" or "Ginnie Mae") mortgage-backed securities issuer that offers conforming mortgages, non-conforming mortgages and home-only loans to purchasers of factory-built homes. Our insurance subsidiary, Standard Casualty Co. ("Standard Casualty"), provides property and casualty insurance primarily to owners of manufactured homes. The terms "Cavco," "us," "we," "our," the "Company," and any other similar terms refer to Cavco Industries, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report").
We construct homes using an assembly-line process in which each module or floor section is completed in stages. This assembly-line process is designed to be flexible in order to accommodate customer requested customizations. Our operations include 20 homebuilding production lines located in the Northwest, Southwest, South, Southeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions and we distribute our homes through 40 Company-owned U.S. retail stores and a network of independent distribution points in 43 states and Canada. Thirty-two Company-owned retail stores are located in Texas.
CountryPlace originates and services single-family, conforming and non-confirming residential mortgages and home-only loans, for itself and others. CountryPlace is authorized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") to directly endorse Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") Title I and Title II mortgage insurance, is an approved lender with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs ("VA") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") under its Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program, is approved by GNMA to issue GNMA-insured mortgage-backed securities and is authorized to sell mortgages to, and service mortgages for, FNMA and FHLMC. A conforming mortgage or loan is one that conforms to the guidelines of a Government-Sponsored Enterprise ("GSE"), such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or a government agency, such as FHA; a non-conforming mortgage or loan does not conform to these guidelines. For further information relating to consumer loans receivable, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Standard Casualty, located in Texas, specializes in homeowner property and casualty insurance products for the manufactured housing industry and holds insurance licenses in multiple states, primarily serving the Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada markets. In addition to writing direct policies, Standard Casualty assumes and cedes reinsurance in the ordinary course of business (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Our operations are generally managed on a decentralized basis with oversight from the home office. This decentralization enables our operators the flexibility to adapt to local market demand, be more customer focused and have the autonomy to make swift decisions, while still being held accountable for operational and financial performance.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 ("COVID-19") a global pandemic. As our business was considered essential, we continued to operate substantially all of our homebuilding and retail sales facilities while working to follow COVID-19 health guidelines. We minimized exposure and transmission risks by implementing enhanced facility cleaning, social distancing and related protocols while continuing to serve our customers. Operational efficiencies have declined due to managing higher and largely unpredictable factory employee absenteeism, hiring challenges and building material supply shortages. Accordingly, our factory capacity utilization rate fluctuated during the fiscal year and was at approximately 75% during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021, lower than pre-pandemic levels of more than 80%.
Company-owned, and most independently owned, retail stores remained open for business since the onset of the pandemic, and sales order activity was exceptionally strong during most of fiscal year 2021. Home sales order rates during the second and third fiscal quarters were nearly 65% higher than the comparable prior year quarters, and nearly 50% higher for the fourth quarter. This increased order volume is the result of more well-qualified home buyers making purchase decisions, supported by reduced home loan interest rates. The increase in orders outpaced production and raised our home order backlog at April 3, 2021 to approximately $603 million in wholesale sales values, up $479 million from $124 million one year earlier.
The financial services segment also maintained operations since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, largely through the implementation of work-from-home solutions. In addition to accepting and processing new applications for home loans and insurance policies, the financial services operations continue to assist customers in need by servicing existing loans and insurance policies while complying with state and federal regulations regarding loan forbearance, home foreclosures and policy cancellations.
It is difficult to predict the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on housing demand, employee availability, our supply chain or the Company's performance and operations. We continue to focus on developing production growth opportunities by working to improve our production capabilities and processes and adjusting product offerings. We strive to balance the production levels and workforce size with the demand for our product offerings to maximize efficiencies. Maintaining an appropriately sized and well-trained workforce is key to increasing production to meet increased demand, and we face a major challenge in overcoming labor-related difficulties in the COVID-19 environment. However, we are continually reviewing wage rates of our production employees and have established other monetary incentive and benefit programs to ensure competitive compensation. We are also working to more extensively use online recruiting tools, update our recruitment brochures and improve the appearance and appeal of our manufacturing facilities to improve the recruitment and retention of qualified production employees and reduce annualized turnover rates.
See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information regarding the Company's business segments, factory-built housing and financial services, which are also discussed below.
Business Strategies
Our marketing efforts are focused on providing manufactured homes that are customizable and appeal to a wide range of home buyers, on a regional basis, in the markets we serve. The primary demographics for our products are entry-level and move-up buyers and persons age 55 and older. We also market to special niches such as subdivision developers and vacation home buyers.
We focus on developing and maintaining the resources necessary to meet our customer's desire for varied and unique specifications in an efficient factory production environment. This enables us to attract distributors and consumers who desire the flexibility the custom home building process provides but who also seek the value and affordability created by building a home on a factory production line.
We strive to maintain a competitive advantage by reacting quickly to changes in the marketplace and to the specific needs of our distributors and consumers. We build homes of superior quality, offer innovative designs and floor plans, demonstrate exceptional value, provide the engineering and technical resources to enable custom home building and focus on responsive and efficient customer service after the sale.
We strategically expanded our factory operations and related business initiatives primarily through the acquisition of other industry participants, which has enabled us to participate in the affordable housing space on a national basis.
Products
A majority of our products are constructed in accordance with the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards promulgated by HUD ("HUD code"). We also build park model RVs, constructed to standards approved by the American National Standards Institute, a private, non-profit organization that administers and coordinates a voluntary standardization and conformity program. Park model RVs are less than 400 square feet in size, primarily used as vacation dwellings and seasonal living, and placed in planned communities, recreational home parks and resorts. We also produce a wide variety of modular homes, which include single and multi-section ranch, split-level and Cape Cod style homes, as well as two and three story homes, multi-family units, and commercial modular structures, including apartment buildings, condominiums, hotels, workforce housing, schools and housing for U.S. military troops (e.g., barracks). Commercial buildings are constructed in the same facilities in which the residential homes are built using similar assembly line processes and techniques. These commercial projects are generally engineered to the purchaser's specifications. The buildings are transported to the customer's site in the same manner as residential homes and are often set by crane and finished at the site.
We produce residential homes in a variety of floor plans. Most of these homes are single-story and generally range in size from approximately 500 to 3,300 square feet, but may be larger in the case of multi-level modular homes. In fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we sold 14,214 and 15,100 factory-built homes, respectively.
Each home typically contains a living room, dining area, kitchen, one to five bedrooms and one or more bathrooms, is equipped with central heat and hot water systems, kitchen appliances, floor coverings and window treatments. Upgrades can include fireplaces, central air conditioning, tile roofs, high ceilings, skylights, hardwood floors, custom cabinetry, granite countertops and eco-friendly elements. We also offer a variety of structural and decorative customizations to meet the home buyer's specifications. With manufacturing facilities strategically positioned across the nation, we utilize local market research to design homes to meet the demands of our customers. We have the ability to react and modify floor plans and designs to consumers' specific needs. By offering a full range of homes from entry-level models to large custom homes and with the ability to engineer designs in-house, we can accommodate a wide spectrum of customer requests.
We regularly introduce new floor plans and options to appeal to changing trends in different regions of the country. We have developed engineering systems that, through the use of computer-aided technology, permit customization of homes and assist with product development and enhancement. We work with a variety of partners to meet the expanding range of housing needs, including a home buyer's private land, planned neighborhoods, recreational or resort properties and workforce accommodations for agriculture and industry.
We employ a concerted effort to identify niche market opportunities where our diverse product lines and custom building capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage. We are focused on building quality, energy efficient homes for the modern home buyer. Our green building initiatives involve the creation of an energy efficient envelope, including higher utilization of renewable materials. These homes provide environmentally-friendly maintenance requirements, typically lower utility costs, specially designed ventilation systems and sustainability. We also build homes designed to use alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind. From bamboo flooring and tankless water heaters to solar-powered homes, our products are diverse and tailored to a wide range of consumer interests.
Once a factory-built home is built at our facilities, it is then generally transported by independent trucking companies either to a retail sales center, planned community, housing development, work site or the home buyer's site. Distributors or other independent installers are responsible for placing the home on site and, in most instances, arranging for connections to utilities and providing installation and finish-out services. Although manufactured homes are designed to be transportable, cost considerations result in very few being moved from their original site after installation.
Factory-built Housing Segment
Manufacturing Operations. Our manufacturing facilities employ from 100 to 350 employees each. Most homes are constructed in one or more floor sections or modules on a permanently affixed steel or wood support chassis. Each section is assembled in stages beginning with the construction of the chassis, followed by the addition of other constructed and purchased components, and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the assembly-line process and the benefits of constructing homes in a controlled factory environment enables us to produce quality homes in less time and at a lower cost per square foot than building homes on individual sites.
We operate 20 homebuilding production lines in Millersburg and Woodburn, Oregon; Nampa, Idaho; Riverside, California; Phoenix and Goodyear, Arizona; Austin, Fort Worth, Seguin and Waco, Texas; Montevideo, Minnesota; Nappanee, Indiana; Lafayette, Tennessee; Martinsville and Rocky Mount, Virginia; Douglas and Moultrie, Georgia; and Ocala and Plant City, Florida. These manufacturing facilities range from approximately 79,000 to 341,000 square feet of floor space. The production schedules for our manufacturing facilities are based on wholesale orders received from independent and Company-owned retailers, planned community operators and residential developers. Our facilities are structured to operate on a one shift per day, five days per week basis, and a typical home is completed in approximately six production days.
Manufactured housing is a regional business and the primary geographic market for a typical manufacturing facility is within a cost effective shipping radius of 350 miles. Each of our manufacturing facilities serve multiple distributors and a number of one-time purchasers. Because homes are produced to fill existing wholesale orders, our factories generally do not carry finished goods inventories, except for homes awaiting delivery. Materials used in homebuilding operations are mainly standard items carried by major suppliers and consist of wood, wood products, steel, gypsum wallboard, windows, doors, fiberglass insulation, carpet, vinyl, fasteners, plumbing materials, aluminum, appliances and electrical items. Fluctuations in the cost of materials and labor may affect gross margins from home sales to the extent that costs cannot be efficiently matched to the home sales price. From time to time and to varying degrees, we may experience shortages in the availability of materials and/or labor in the markets served. These shortages may result in extended order backlogs, delays in the delivery of homes, and reduced gross margins from home sales. As described in more detail elsewhere in this Annual Report, impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to such disruptions.
Sales order backlogs increased to $603 million at April 3, 2021, up $479 million compared to $124 million at March 28, 2020. Distributors may cancel orders prior to production without penalty. After production of a particular home has commenced, the order becomes non-cancelable and the distributor is obligated to take delivery of the home. Accordingly, until production of a particular home has commenced, we do not consider order backlog to be firm orders.
Distribution. We sold 14,214, 15,100 and 14,389 factory-built homes in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, through Company-owned and independent distribution channels.
As of April 3, 2021, there were a total of 40 Company-owned retail stores, located in Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Florida. Thirty-two of the Company-owned retail stores are located in Texas. Company-owned retail stores are generally located on main roads or highways with high visibility, each having a sales office, which is generally a factory-built structure, and a variety of model homes of various sizes, floor plans, features and prices. Customers most often custom order a home to be built at one of our manufacturing facilities, or they may purchase a home from the inventory of homes maintained at retail locations, including a model home. Model homes may be displayed in a residential setting with sidewalks and landscaping. Each sales center usually employs a manager and one to five salespersons, who are compensated through a combination of salary and commission. We internally finance home inventories at Company-owned retail stores.
As of April 3, 2021, we had a network of independent distributors, of which 13% were in Arizona, 9% in Texas, 8% each in California and Florida, 7% in Oregon, 6% in Georgia and 5% each in North Carolina and Washington, based on the quantity of wholesale shipments during fiscal year 2021. The remaining 39% were in 35 other states and Canada. As is common in the industry, our independent distributors typically sell homes produced by other manufacturers in addition to those we produce. Some independent distributors operate multiple sales outlets. No independent distributor accounted for 10% or more of factory-built housing revenue during any fiscal year within the three-year period ended April 3, 2021.
We continually seek to increase wholesale shipments by growing sales at existing independent distributors and by identifying new independent distributors to sell our homes. We provide comprehensive sales and product training, either physically or virtually, to independent retail sales associates, including providing opportunities to visit our manufacturing facilities to discuss and view new product designs as they are developed. These training seminars facilitate the sale of our homes by increasing the skill and knowledge of the retail sales consultants. In addition, we display our products at trade shows and support our distributors through the distribution of floor plan literature, brochures, decor selection displays, point of sale promotional material and internet-based marketing assistance.
Independent distributors frequently finance a portion of their home purchases through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements. In most cases, we receive a deposit or a commitment from the distributor's lender for each home ordered. We then manufacture the home and ship it at the distributor's expense. Payment is due from the lender upon shipment of the product. For a description of wholesale floor plan financing arrangements used by independent distributors and our obligations in connection with these arrangements, see "Company Provided Financing —Commercial Financing" below.
Warranties. We provide the retail home buyer a one-year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure, plumbing and electrical systems. Nonstructural components of a cosmetic nature are warranted for 120 days, except in specific cases where state laws require longer warranty terms. The warranty does not extend to installation and setup of the home, as the distributor is generally responsible for these activities. Appliances, floor coverings, roofing and certain other components are warranted by their original manufacturer for various lengths of time.
Financial Services Segment
Finance. We provide a source of retail home buyer financing on competitive terms through our subsidiary, CountryPlace. We offer conforming and non-conforming mortgages and home-only loans to purchasers of numerous brands of factory-built homes sold by Company-owned retail stores including certain independent distributors, builders, communities and developers. We are authorized to directly endorse FHA Title I and Title II mortgage insurance, are an approved lender with the VA and the USDA under its Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program, are approved to issue GNMA-insured mortgage-backed securities and are authorized to sell mortgages to, and service mortgages for, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Most loans originated by us are sold to investors, and we provide various loan servicing functions for non-affiliated entities under contract.
The loan contracts are fixed and step rate and have monthly scheduled payments of principal and interest. The scheduled payments for each contract would, if made on their respective due dates, result in a full amortization of the contract. Loan contracts secured by collateral that is geographically concentrated could experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and foreclosure losses than loan contracts secured by collateral that is more geographically dispersed. Our loan contracts are secured by factory-built homes located in 26 states, with the largest concentrations in Texas, Florida, Arizona, Oklahoma and New Mexico. See Note  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional geographic concentration information.
With respect to the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are complying with all state and federal regulations regarding loan forbearance and home foreclosures. See further details in the "Government Regulation" section below. We initially increased our loan loss reserves and continue to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves as economic conditions change.
Certain loans serviced for investors expose us to cash flow deficits if customers do not make contractual monthly payments of principal and interest in a timely manner. For certain loans serviced for Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, and home-only loans serviced for certain other investors, we must remit scheduled monthly principal and/or interest payments and principal curtailments regardless of whether monthly mortgage payments are collected from borrowers. Ginnie Mae permits cash obligations on loans in forbearance from COVID-19 to be offset by other incoming cash flows from loans such as loan pre-payments. Through fiscal year 2021, monthly collections of principal and interest from borrowers have exceeded scheduled principal and interest payments owed to investors; however, mandatory extended forbearance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") and certain other regulations related to COVID-19 could negatively impact cash obligations in the future.
We believe that providing financing alternatives improves our responsiveness to the financing needs of prospective home buyers and presents opportunities for additional sources of loan origination and servicing revenues. We have expanded our home-only lending programs in recent years, partially with the support of independent third-party financiers. Home-only loans originated are either sold outright, grouped and sold as a pool of loans, or held for investment.
Insurance. Standard Casualty, located in Texas, specializes in homeowner property and casualty insurance products for the manufactured housing industry and holds insurance licenses in multiple states, primarily serving the Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada markets. In addition to writing direct policies, we assume and cede reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. In Texas, policies are written through one affiliated managing general agent, which produces all premiums, and through local agents, most of which are manufactured home distributors. All business outside the state of Texas is written on a direct basis through local agents.
Company Provided Financing
Consumer Financing. Sales of factory-built homes are significantly affected by the availability and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory-built housing industry: conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of FHA, VA, USDA or GSE loans; non-conforming mortgages for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed; and personal property loans (often referred to as home-only or chattel loans) for consumers where the home is the sole collateral for the loan (generally HUD code homes).
Restrictive underwriting guidelines and higher interest rates compared to mortgages for site-built homes, a limited number of institutions lending to manufactured home buyers and limited secondary market availability for non-conforming mortgages and home-only personal property loans secured by manufactured homes continue to constrain industry growth. We work directly with other industry participants to develop secondary market opportunities for manufactured home-only loan portfolios and expand lending availability in the industry. Additionally, we continue to invest in community-based lending initiatives that provide home-only financing to new residents of certain manufactured home communities. We also develop and invest in home-only lending programs to grow sales of homes through traditional distribution points. We believe that growing our investment and participation in home-only lending may provide additional sales growth opportunities for our factory-built housing operations and reduce our exposure to the actions of independent lenders.
We also work with industry trade associations to encourage favorable legislative and GSE action to address the mortgage financing needs of buyers of affordable homes. Federal law requires GSEs to implement the "Duty to Serve" requirements specified in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. In December 2017, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac released their final Underserved Markets Plans that describe, with specificity, the actions they would take over a three-year period to fulfill the "Duty to Serve" obligation. These plans became effective on January 1, 2018. On January 5, 2021, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the GSE regulator, announced that it had issued "Non-Objections" to modified plans which are extended through 2021. The plans offered enhanced mortgage loan products for manufactured homes titled as real property through Fannie Mae's "MH Advantage" and Freddie Mac's "ChoiceHome" programs that began in the latter part of calendar year 2018. Although some progress has been made with these programs, meaningful positive impact in the form of increased home orders has yet to be realized. Small-scale pilot programs included in the plans for the purchase of home-only loans have not occurred. Public input into the GSE’s proposed 2022-2024 Underserved Markets Plans is scheduled for summer 2021. Expansion of the secondary market for home-only loans through GSEs could support further demand for housing as lending options would likely become more available to home buyers.
Commercial Financing. Certain of our wholesale factory-built housing sales to independent distributors are purchased through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in this line of business provides the distributor with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires Cavco, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution that, upon default by the distributor and under certain other circumstances, obligates us to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which, in most cases, is 18 to 24 months). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $74.2 million and $79.3 million as of April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many distributors and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes that we obtain upon the execution of a repurchase.
We continue to make certain commercial loan programs available to members of our wholesale distribution chain. Under our commercial loan arrangements, we provide funds for financed home purchases by distributors, community owners and developers as well as provide loans to independent floor plan lenders that then lend to distributors to finance their inventory purchases (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our involvement in commercial loans helps to increase the availability of manufactured home financing to distributors, community owners and developers and provides additional opportunity for product exposure to potential home buyers. While these initiatives support our ongoing efforts to expand product distribution, they do expose us to risks associated with the creditworthiness of this customer base and our inventory financing partners. We have included considerations related to the COVID-19 pandemic when assessing the risks of loan loss and setting reserve amounts for the commercial finance portfolio.
Industry Overview
General. Manufactured housing provides an alternative to other forms of new low-cost housing such as site-built housing and condominiums, and to existing housing such as pre-owned homes and apartments. According to statistics published by the Institute for Building Technology and Safety and the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, for the 2020 calendar year, manufactured housing wholesale shipments of homes constructed in accordance with the HUD code accounted for an estimated 10.3% of all new single-family homes sold.
According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute, approximately 94,000 HUD code manufactured homes were shipped during calendar year 2020, compared to the 95,000 shipped during calendar year 2019 and 97,000 shipments in 2018. Prior to 2019, annual shipments had increased each year since calendar year 2009 when 50,000 HUD code manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959.
Home Buyer Demographics. We believe the sector of the housing market in which manufactured housing is most competitive includes consumers from diverse backgrounds with household incomes under $40,000. This segment has a high representation of persons age 55 and older, as well as young single persons and young married couples. The low cost of a fully-equipped manufactured home compared to a site-built alternative is attractive to these consumers. Persons in rural areas and those who presently live in manufactured homes also make up a significant portion of the demand for new manufactured housing. Innovative engineering and design, as well as efficient production techniques, continue to position manufactured homes to meet the demand for affordable housing in rural markets and manufactured housing communities. The markets for affordable factory-built housing are very competitive, as well as cyclical and seasonal. The industry is sensitive to employment levels, consumer confidence, the availability of financing and general economic conditions.
"First-time" and "move-up" buyers of affordable homes are historically among the largest segments of new manufactured home purchasers. Included in this group are lower-income households that are particularly affected by periods of low employment rates and underemployment. Consumer confidence is especially important among manufactured home buyers interested in our products for seasonal or retirement living.
The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics, young adults and those who are age 55 and older, are both growing. The U.S. adult population is estimated to expand by approximately 9.2 million between 2021 and 2026. Young adults born from 1976 to 1995, often referred to as Gen Y or Millennials, represent a large segment of the population who are generally first-time home buyers attracted by the affordability, diversity and location flexibility of factory-built homes. The age 55 and older category is reported to be the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. This group is similarly interested in the value proposition; however, they are also motivated by the energy efficiency and low maintenance requirements of factory-built homes, and by the lifestyle offered by planned communities that are specifically designed for homeowners that fall into this age group.
Competition
The manufactured housing industry is highly competitive at both the wholesale and retail levels, with competition based on several factors including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution, promotion, merchandising and the terms of retail customer financing. We compete with more than 30 other producers of manufactured homes, as well as with new and existing apartments, townhouses and condominiums and site-built homes.
There are a number of other national manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the United States, including Clayton Homes, Inc. and Skyline Champion Corporation, which may possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution and marketing resources than us.
There are significant competitors to CountryPlace in the markets served. These competitors include national, regional and local banks, mortgage banks and independent finance companies such as: 21st Mortgage Corporation, an affiliate of Clayton Homes, Inc. and Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.; Triad Financial Services, Inc.; and Cascade Financial Services. Certain of these competitors are larger than CountryPlace and have access to substantially more capital and cost efficiencies. CountryPlace remains competitive in breadth of loan product offerings, interest rates, customer service and loan servicing capabilities.
The market for homeowners' insurance is highly competitive as well. Standard Casualty competes principally in property and casualty insurance for owners of manufactured homes with companies such as National Lloyds and American Modern Insurance, which may be larger and offer broader types of insurance allowing them to be more aggressive in their underwriting standards. Standard Casualty remains competitive in price, breadth of product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling and use of technology.
Government Regulation
Our manufactured homes are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. Construction of manufactured housing is governed by the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended, also referred to as the Home Construction Act. In 1976, HUD issued regulations under the Home Construction Act establishing comprehensive national construction standards. In 1994, the codes were amended and expanded to, among other things, address specific requirements for homes destined for geographic areas subject to severe weather conditions. The HUD regulations, known collectively as the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, cover all aspects of manufactured home construction, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. Such regulations preempt conflicting state and local regulations on such matters and are subject to periodic change. Our manufacturing facilities, and the plans and specifications of the HUD code manufactured homes they produce, have been approved by a HUD-certified inspection agency. Further, an independent HUD-certified third-party inspector regularly reviews our manufactured homes for compliance with HUD regulations during construction. Failure to comply with applicable HUD regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions, including mandated closings of our manufacturing facilities. We believe our manufactured homes are in substantial compliance with all present HUD requirements. Our park model RVs are not subject to HUD regulations, but we believe that our park model RVs are in substantial compliance with the standards of the American National Standards Institute.
Transporting manufactured homes on highways is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities. Such regulations may prescribe size and road use limitations and impose lower than normal speed limits and various other requirements. Generally, our distributors are responsible for the transportation of homes from our factory to the final destination through independent third-party transportation companies.
Our manufactured homes are subject to local zoning and housing regulations. In certain cities and counties in areas where our homes are sold, local governmental ordinances and regulations have been enacted which restrict the placement of manufactured homes on privately-owned land or which require the placement of manufactured homes in manufactured home communities. Such ordinances and regulations may adversely impact our ability to sell homes for installation in communities where they are in effect. A number of states have adopted procedures governing the installation of manufactured homes. Utility connections are subject to state and local regulations, which must be complied with by the distributor or other person installing the home.
Certain warranties we issue, including our principal homeowners' warranties, may be subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act (the "Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act"), which regulates the descriptions of warranties on consumer products. In the case of warranties subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, we are subject to a number of additional regulatory requirements. For example, warranties that are subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act must be included in a single easy-to-read document that is generally made available prior to purchase. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act also prohibits certain attempts to disclaim or modify implied warranties and the use of deceptive or misleading terms. A claim for a violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act can be the subject of an action in federal court in which consumers may be able to recover attorneys' fees. The description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations. A number of states require manufactured home producers and distributors to post bonds to ensure the satisfaction of consumer warranty claims.
A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (the "Truth-in-Lending Act" or "TILA") and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and any finance charges. The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act also requires certain disclosures to potential customers concerning credit information used as a basis to deny credit. The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder prohibit discrimination against any credit applicant based on certain specified grounds. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA") and Regulation X promulgated thereunder require certain disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") has adopted or proposed various Trade Regulation Rules dealing with unfair credit and collection practices and the preservation of consumers' claims and defenses. Direct loans and mortgage loans eligible for inclusion in a Ginnie Mae security are subject to the credit underwriting requirements of the FHA, USDA or VA. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees chargeable pursuant to financing documents. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, implemented by Regulation F, applies to certain loans and contracts that we service for certain investors and prohibits debt collectors from engaging in harassment or abuse, making false or misleading representations, or engaging in unfair practices in debt collection.
In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was passed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act was a sweeping piece of legislation designed to reform credit and lending practices after the global credit crisis of 2008. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Reform Act") was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Reform Act revises portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, reduces the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions, including eliminating certain provisions of the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (the "SAFE Act"), and protects consumer access to credit. With the elimination of certain provisions of the SAFE Act, manufactured housing distributors can now assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they may not assist in negotiating the financing terms. This has facilitated access to financing and makes the overall home buying experience smoother for the consumer.
Certain CFPB mortgage finance rules required under the Dodd-Frank Act, and modified by the Dodd-Frank Reform Act, apply to consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, which include real property mortgages and home-only loans secured by manufactured homes. These rules defined standards for origination of "Qualified Mortgages," established specific requirements for lenders to prove borrowers' ability to repay loans and outlined the conditions under which Qualified Mortgages are subject to safe harbor limitations on liability to borrowers. The rules also establish interest rates and other cost parameters for determining which Qualified Mortgages fall under safe harbor protection. Among other issues, Qualified Mortgages with interest rates and other costs outside the limits are deemed "rebuttable" by borrowers and expose the lender and its assignees (including investors in loans, pools of loans, and instruments secured by loans or loan pools) to possible litigation and penalties.
The CFPB issued a final rule, effective October 1, 2022, which expands the definition of a "General Qualified Mortgage" and gives lenders more leeway to determine a borrower's likelihood of repayment. Under the original Qualified Mortgage rule, the ratio of the consumer’s total monthly debt to total monthly income could not exceed 43% for a loan to be considered a Qualified Mortgage. In December 2020, the Bureau issued a "QM Final Rule" which amended Regulation Z by replacing the original, debt ratio-based Qualified Mortgage definition with a limit based on loan pricing, among other changes to the definition.
The original Qualified Mortgage rule also defined a temporary category of Qualified Mortgages, commonly known as the GSE Patch, which includes mortgages that are eligible to be purchased or guaranteed by either of the GSEs while operating under the federal conservatorship. Under the original Qualified Mortgage rule, the GSE Patch was set to expire on July 1, 2021. Under the QM Final Rule, the GSE Patch will expire upon the earlier of October 1, 2022, or the date the applicable GSE exits federal conservatorship.
While many manufactured homes are currently financed with agency-conforming mortgages in which the ability to repay is verified, and interest rates and other costs are within the safe harbor limits established under the CFPB mortgage finance rules, certain loans to finance the purchase of manufactured homes, especially home-only loans and non-conforming mortgages, may fall outside the safe harbor limits. The rules have caused some lenders to curtail underwriting such loans, and some investors are reluctant to own or participate in owning such loans because of the uncertainty of potential litigation and other costs. As a result, some prospective buyers of manufactured homes may be unable to secure the financing necessary to complete purchases. In addition, compliance with the law and ongoing rule implementation has caused lenders to incur additional costs to implement new processes, procedures, controls and infrastructure required to comply with the regulations. Compliance may constrain lenders' ability to profitably price certain loans. Failure to comply with these regulations, changes in these or other regulations, or the imposition of additional regulations, could affect our earnings, limit our access to capital and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
The CFPB rules amending TILA and RESPA expanded the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the Home Ownership and Equity Protections Act of 1994 ("HOEPA"), revised and expanded the tests for coverage under HOEPA, and imposed additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA. As a result, certain manufactured home loans are subject to HOEPA limits on interest rates and fees. Loans with rates or fees in excess of the limits are deemed "High Cost Mortgages" and provide additional protections for borrowers, including with respect to determining the value of the home. Most loans for the purchase of manufactured homes have been written at rates and fees that would not appear to be considered High Cost Mortgages under the new rule. Although some lenders may continue to offer loans that are now deemed High Cost Mortgages, the rate and fee limits appear to have deterred some lenders from offering loans to certain borrowers and may continue to make them reluctant to enter into loans subject to the provisions of HOEPA. As a result, some prospective buyers of manufactured homes may be unable to secure financing necessary to complete manufactured home purchases.
The Dodd-Frank Act amended provisions of TILA to require rules for appraisals on principal residences securing higher-priced mortgage loans ("HPML"). Certain loans secured by manufactured homes, primarily home-only loans, could be considered HPMLs. Among other things, the rules require creditors to provide copies of appraisal reports to borrowers prior to loan closing. To implement these amendments, the CFPB adopted the HPML Appraisal Rule, effective December 30, 2014, and loans secured by new manufactured homes were exempt from the rule until July 18, 2015. While it's not possible to determine the magnitude of these changes, some prospective home buyers may be deterred from completing a manufactured home purchase as a result of appraised values.
The Dodd-Frank Act also required integrating disclosures provided by lenders to borrowers under TILA and RESPA. The final rule became effective October 3, 2015. The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure ("TRID") mandated extensive changes to the mortgage loan closing process and necessitated significant changes to mortgage origination systems.
Regulation C of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ("HMDA") requires certain financial institutions, including non-depository institutions, to collect, record, report and disclose information about their mortgage lending activity. The data-related requirements in the HMDA and Regulation C are used to identify potential discriminatory lending patterns and enforce anti-discrimination statutes. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred rulemaking authority for HMDA to the CFPB, effective in 2011. It also amended HMDA to require financial institutions to report additional data points and to collect, record and report additional information. The CFPB issued a final rule amending Regulation C, which became effective on January 1, 2018. Regulation C generally applies to consumer-purpose, closed-end loans and open-end lines of credit that are secured by a dwelling. Non-depository financial institutions are subject to Regulation C if they originate at least 25 covered closed-end mortgage loans or at least 100 covered open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. Violations of Regulation C, including incomplete, inaccurate, or omitted data, are subject to administrative sanctions, including civil money penalties, and compliance can be enforced by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, HUD or the CFPB.
New FHA Title I program guidelines became effective on June 1, 2010 and provide Ginnie Mae the ability to securitize manufactured home FHA Title I loans. These guidelines were intended to allow lenders to obtain new capital, which can then be used to fund new loans for their customers. Home-only loans have languished for several years and these changes were meant to broaden home-only financing availability for prospective homeowners. However, we are aware of only a small number of loans currently being securitized under the Ginnie Mae program.
The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 requires GSEs to facilitate a secondary market for mortgages on housing for very low, low and moderate-income families in under-served markets, including manufactured housing. On January 30, 2017, the Federal Housing Finance Agency issued a final rule specifying the scope of GSE activities that are eligible to receive credit for compliance with the "Duty to Serve" rule after January 2018. In December 2017, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each released their final Underserved Markets Plans that describe, with specificity, the actions they would take over a three-year period to fulfill the "Duty to Serve" obligation. These plans became effective on January 1, 2018. On January 5, 2021, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the GSE regulator, announced that it had issued "Non-Objections" to modified plans which are extended through 2021. The plans offered enhanced mortgage loan products for manufactured homes titled as real property through Fannie Mae's "MH Advantage" and Freddie Mac's "ChoiceHome" programs that began in the latter part of calendar year 2018. Although some progress has been made with these programs, meaningful positive impact in the form of increased home orders has yet to be realized. Small-scale pilot programs included in the plans for the purchase of home-only loans have not occurred. Public input into the GSE’s proposed 2022-2024 Underserved Markets Plans is scheduled for summer 2021. Expansion of the secondary market for home-only loans through GSEs could support further demand for housing as lending options would likely become more available to home buyers.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. While the CARES Act contains a variety of provisions, including, among other things, unemployment benefit expansion and emergency funding of public health care initiatives, it also grants forbearance rights and foreclosure protection to borrowers with loans purchased by a GSE or insured by FHA, USDA or VA. Borrowers with these federally backed mortgage loans who are experiencing hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic may request forbearance for 6 months, regardless of delinquency status. Forbearance may be extended for an additional 6 months at the borrower's request, and they may request up to two additional three-month extensions, for a maximum of 18 months of total forbearance. On March 29, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control ("CDC") extended the existing eviction moratorium until June 30, 2021, although the CDC extension is the subject of pending litigation. The CARES Act prohibits mortgage servicers from charging borrowers a fee for late payments during forbearance and from initiating a foreclosure process, moving for a foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or executing a foreclosure-related eviction or foreclosure sale for any federally backed mortgage loan. The CARES Act also amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act by providing that, from January 31, 2020 and until 120 days after the COVID-19 national emergency is terminated, mortgage servicers granting payment forbearance are required to report the mortgages in forbearance as paid current unless the mortgages were delinquent before the period of forbearance. As of the date of this report, the national emergency had not been terminated.
The CARES Act also contains corporate income tax provisions that will be advantageous to the Company, including providing temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of social security taxes and the creation of certain refundable employee retention credits.
In addition to the CARES Act, numerous state and local governments have issued temporary emergency orders recommending or mandating that mortgage servicers accommodate borrowers experiencing hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These emergency orders include a variety of provisions, including payment forbearance, waiver of late fees on past due payments, restrictions on reporting payment status to credit reporting agencies and moratorium on debt collection activities, foreclosures and evictions. We have implemented practices and adjusted policies to comply accordingly.
On April 19, 2021, the CFPB issued an interim final rule, effective November 30, 2021, amending Regulation F to require debt collectors to provide written notice to certain consumers of their protections under the CDC's eviction moratorium order of March 29, 2021. The interim final rule also prohibits certain communications methods and content, and places limits on debt collectors' attempts to communicate with consumers who are obligated to repay debt, attorneys representing them or related parties.
 Standard Casualty's insurance operations are regulated by the state insurance departments where it underwrites its policies. Our insurance product sales are subject to various state insurance laws and regulations, which govern allowable charges and other insurance practices. Underwriting, premiums, investments and capital reserves (including dividend payments to stockholders) are subject to the rules and regulations of these state agencies.
In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the "Health Reform Law"), was passed into law. As enacted, the Health Reform Law reforms, among other things, certain aspects of health insurance. We believe that the health plans we offer are in compliance with the Health Reform Law.
Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations, and violations may result in the payment of fines, the entry of injunctions or both. Although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations, these requirements have generally become more stringent in recent years. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with all applicable laws and enforcement policies.
Seasonality
The housing industry is generally subject to seasonal fluctuations based on new home buyer purchasing patterns. Demand for our core new home products typically peaks each spring and summer before declining in the winter, consistent with the overall housing industry, although this pattern has become distorted during the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. Diversification among our product lines and operations has partially offset the extent of any seasonal fluctuations. Additionally, demand patterns for park model RVs, cabins and homes used primarily for retirement or seasonal living partially offset general housing seasonality.
CountryPlace realizes no seasonal impacts from its mortgage servicing operations. However, the mortgage subsidiary does experience minimal seasonal fluctuation in its mortgage origination activities because of the time needed for loan application approval processes and subsequent home loan closing activities. Revenue for Standard Casualty is also not substantially impacted by seasonality, as it recognizes revenue from policy sales ratably over each policy's term year. However, we are subject to adverse effects from excessive policy claims that may occur during periods of inclement weather, including seasonal spring storms or fall hurricane activity in Texas where most of our policies are underwritten. Where applicable, losses from catastrophic events are somewhat limited by reinsurance contracts in place as part of our loss mitigation structure.
Human Capital Resources
Our workforce is made up of approximately 4,700 skilled full-time team members. We believe that an engaged, productive workforce is critically important to creating shareholder value. To that end, we are committed to providing opportunities for professional growth and advancement based on performance, qualification, demonstrated skill and achievement.
During the year, we launched a number of internal programs and campaigns to enhance the culture and capability of our workforce. Driven by our aspiration to make a difference by focusing on excellence, we are executing on a strategy that is designed to elevate and drive the recruiting, retention and experience of our team members. One of our initiatives this year included refreshing our Code of Conduct, and then executing a multi-channel bi-lingual compliance training initiative so that our team members will understand our commitment to, and their responsibility for, maintaining high standards of integrity in the workplace. The program continues to be rolled out through our new learning management system, and each new and existing team member is provided the same training. Another initiative was providing leadership training to new managers and other employees in supervisory roles to enhance communication and other critical management skills to improve the oversight and motivation of other employees.
Also emblematic of our approach to human resources is how we demonstrated our commitment to our employees by how we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. In March of 2020, we created a COVID-19 task force that continues to meet regularly to discuss, among other things, recent infection and related trends and the new CDC recommendations. The task force determines protocols and procedures to maintain health and safety within our plants and across our operations for the safety of our customers and trade partners. We adjusted our paid time off and certain other employment-related policies, provided support programs for team members and made changes to our benefits programs and health plans to provide care, testing and vaccinations for our team members. We have taken steps to maintain a safe working environment, including requiring face masks, providing visual markers, implementing technology solutions, social distancing and placing a high priority on cleaning our facilities for the safety of our team members.
