Markets
 
Our systems are used in the creation of a broad range of microelectronic components, including LEDs, MEMS, radio frequency (RF) filters, power semiconductors, thin film magnetic heads (TFMHs), and other semiconductor devices. Our customers who manufacture these devices invest in our systems to develop next generation products and deliver more efficient, cost effective, and advanced technological solutions. We operate in a cyclical business environment, and our customers buying patterns are dependent upon industry trends. Our products are sold into multiple markets, and the following discussion focuses on the trends that most influence our business within each of those markets.
Lighting, Display & Power Electronics
 
LED technology has existed for more than 50 years; however, commercial adoption of LEDs was limited to niche applications until the most recent decade. In the early 1990s, researchers developed a process utilizing Gallium Nitride (GaN) that created a low cost blue LED to produce white light. With that breakthrough, the LED industry started, and the number of applications for LEDs began to expand.
 
Since that time, the LED industry has experienced multiple growth cycles brought on by the adoption of LED technology for consumer and commercial applications. The first wave of LED growth was driven by mobile phones, which implemented the use of LED technology for display backlighting. The LED industry experienced its second period of rapid growth as LEDs were adopted for TV display backlighting. More recently, the adoption of LEDs for solid state lighting has given rise to a third wave of demand. LED technology offers energy and cost savings opportunities in lighting, which align with the global shift toward energy efficiency initiatives.
 
Our metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technology is at the core of the manufacturing process for GaN-based LEDs. We have benefited with each growth cycle, as LED producers invest in MOCVD process equipment to capture share in these markets. Demand for our equipment has historically been cyclical in nature, influenced by multiple factors, including: macroeconomic conditions; prices for LED chips; supply and demand dynamics; and our customers manufacturing plans. However, we expect the ongoing adoption of LED lighting to drive the need for additional MOCVD capacity over the next several years.
 
MOCVD technology is equally important in the manufacturing of red, orange, and yellow (ROY) LEDs, which are used increasingly for fine-pitch digital signage and automotive lighting applications. For these applications, our MOCVD technology is used to deposit highly uniform Arsenic Phosphide (AsP) films which create amber and red hues. AsP MOCVD technology is also used to produce multiple other devices including infrared LEDs and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELS) used for optical data communication. While the market opportunity for AsP MOCVD technology is smaller than the GaN MOCVD market for blue LEDs, we expect to also benefit from growth driven by increased adoption of LED technology for automobiles, outdoor display, signage, and other applications.
 
Our MOCVD technologies are also crucial in the manufacturing of GaN-on-Silicon based power electronic devices. Global demand is increasing for advanced power electronics with greater energy efficiency, smaller footprints, higher operating temperatures, faster switching capabilities, and greater reliability. These devices support many needs, including
 
4




more efficient IT servers, electrical motors, electric vehicles, wind turbines, and photovoltaic power inverters.
 
While silicon-based transistors are widely used in power electronic devices today, GaN-on-Silicon based power electronics developed on MOCVD tools can potentially deliver higher performance (e.g., smaller power supply form factors, higher efficiency, and faster switching speeds). In recent years, global industry leaders in power electronics have focused on research and development (R&D) programs to commercialize this new technology. Device manufacturers will likely begin to transition from development to production of these devices over the next couple of years; we can benefit from this transition as our customers invest in process equipment to support this production ramp-up.
 
In addition to depositing the critical GaN layer with our MOCVD products, our Precision Surface Processing (PSP) products address multiple etch and clean steps required to manufacture these advanced power electronics and LED devices.
 
Advanced Packaging, MEMS & RF
 
Advanced Packaging includes a portfolio of wafer-level assembly technologies that enable the miniaturization and performance improvement of electronic products, such as smartphones, smartwatches, and other mobile applications. As process steps such as wet etch and cleans in Advanced Packaging have become increasingly more challenging, our PSP products have been gaining traction in this growing market segment. Demand for higher performance, increased functionality, smaller form factors, and lower power consumption in mobile devices, consumer electronics, and high performance computing is driving the adoption of advanced packaging technology. Independent Device Manufacturers (IDMs) and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) companies are implementing multiple advanced packaging approaches including Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging (FO-WLP), recently deployed in high-volume manufacturing and Through Silicon Via (TSV) to enable stacked memory, 2.5D, and 3D packaging devices.
 
MEMS devices are used for an increasing number of applications, including accelerometers for automobile airbags, pressure sensors for medical uses, and gyroscopes for a variety of consumer products, such as gaming consoles and mobile devices. One of the fastest growing MEMS applications has been RF filters for mobile devices, driven by increasingly complex wireless standards, the exponential growth of mobile data, and carrier aggregation. In order to address these growing demands, the number of discrete RF filters in an average smartphone is expected to double from 50 to 100 by 2020. These trends are positive for us, particularly for our PSP products, where our technology is enabling some of the most challenging process steps, as well as our ion beam etch and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) products, which are used to create Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) and Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) RF filters.
 
Data Storage
 
The Data Storage market involves the storage of data in electromagnetic or other forms for use by a computer or other devices, including HDDs used in large capacity storage applications. While HDDs face significant competition from flash memory, we believe that HDDs will continue to provide significant value for mass storage and will remain at the forefront of large capacity storage applications. This is especially true for data center applications where large volumes of data storage are required to serve an increasingly mobile population. The HDD manufacturing industry continues to optimize its existing manufacturing capacity to address demand. As a result, we expect future sales to be focused on implementation of new technologies as opposed to capacity expansion. Future demand for our data storage systems is unclear and sales are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our process knowledge and magnetic materials expertise from the Data Storage market positions us well for certain front-end semiconductor and MEMS opportunities, as thin film magnetic manufacturing methods become increasingly used in these markets.
Scientific & Industrial
 
The Scientific and Industrial markets include advanced materials research and a broad range of manufacturing applications including high-power fiber lasers, infrared detectors, optical coatings, and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photomasks blanks.
 
Our MBE systems are used by scientific research organizations and universities to drive new discoveries in the areas of materials science. MBE enables precise epitaxial crystal growth for a wide variety of materials, which supports the
 
5




development of new performance materials used for emerging technologies. MBE technology is also used in the manufacturing of products such as high-power lasers and infrared sensors. Our tools create highly uniform Gallium-Arsenide (GaAs) or Indium-Phosphide (InPh) film layers, which are critical to the performance of these devices. Our PSP products are also used to manufacture infrared sensors.
 
Our Ion Beam Deposition (IBD) tools are used to produce high quality optical films for multiple applications including laser mirrors, optical filters, and anti-reflective coatings. Our tools deposit thin layers of advanced materials on various substrates to alter how light is reflected and transmitted. Our ability to precisely deposit high quality films with extremely low particulate levels make our ion beam deposition technology ideal for manufacturing defect-free EUV photomask blanks. The front-end semiconductor industry is expected to adopt EUV lithography to meet future device requirements. Future growth will depend on overall adoption of EUV technology.
