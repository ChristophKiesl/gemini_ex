Item 1.  
Business
 Overview
 We are a global leader in specialty memory solutions, serving the electronics industry for over 25 years. As part of our global business, we have established a leading market position, as measured by market share, in Brazil as the largest in-country manufacturer of memory for desktops, notebooks and servers, as well as mobile memory for smartphones. We also have a leading market position worldwide, as measured by revenue, in specialty memory where we work closely with original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers to develop memory solutions, which incorporate customer-specific requirements. We believe our customers rely on us as a strategic supplier due to our customer specific designs, product quality and technical support, our global footprint and, in Brazil, our ability to provide locally manufactured memory products. We also provide customized, integrated supply chain services to certain OEM customers to assist them in the management and execution of their procurement processes. Our global, diversified customer base includes over 250 end customers such as Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or HPE, Dell Technologies, or Dell, and LG Electronics, or LG.
 Since 2002, when we commenced our operations in Brazil, we have invested over $170 million to build and improve our advanced manufacturing facilities and have assembled and trained a staff of over 480 employees, who comprise many of the leading semiconductor technology professionals in the country. In Brazil, we process imported wafers and cut, package and test them to create memory components used to manufacture modules and other memory and Flash-based products. We are the only company engaged in packaging and test for mobile memory for smartphones in Brazil. We have a strategic, long-term relationship with a global memory wafer supplier that has provided us with a stable source of competitively priced wafers for the Brazilian market and provides our supplier with access to that market through our in-country infrastructure and capabilities.
 Our business in Brazil has historically focused on Dynamic Random Access Memory, or DRAM, components and modules for desktops, notebooks and servers, where local content and tax regulations provide substantial financial incentives to our customers to procure locally manufactured memory products, particularly when they are made with locally processed components. We have leveraged our experience and success in these markets to expand into mobile memory, primarily for smartphones, which include embedded multi-media controllers, or eMMC, and embedded multi-chip package, or eMCP products, where additional local content requirements and tax incentives have been introduced. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, these mobile memory products accounted for 67%, 65% and 29%, respectively, of our net sales in Brazil. Based on industry reports of expected unit sales for mobile phones in Brazil, taking into account our average selling price of approximately $19.08 per eMCP for mobile memory during the full fiscal year 2017, we believe that the total addressable market for locally produced mobile memory for mobile phones in Brazil will reach approximately $580 million by 2019. We have also demonstrated our ability to service the smartphone market in Brazil as we are now qualified at seven of the top ten mobile vendors in Brazil representing, according to industry data, over 85% of the mobile phones sold in Brazil in calendar 2016.
 The Brazilian government has a long history of utilizing local content requirements to promote job creation, sustain economic growth and increase the competitiveness of various domestic industries. Local content requirements have been important in the development of numerous industries in Brazil, including automotive, oil and gas, aerospace, healthcare and IT. Beginning in 1991, local content regulation was introduced to vitalize Brazil’s IT industry. Specifically, requirements for locally manufactured memory have been in place for over 22 years and have increased significantly over time as manufacturing capacity has increased. For example, in notebooks, the requirement for locally manufactured DRAM integrated circuits, or ICs, has increased from 30% in 2010 to 80% in 2016, which means that 80% of the DRAM modules purchased by an OEM in 2016 for use in notebooks for the Brazil market must contain ICs locally manufactured in order for the OEM to qualify for certain tax benefits. As a result of the proliferation of mobile devices, the requirements for locally manufactured embedded memory for smartphones were introduced in March 2014, which has increased from 5% in 2014 to 50% in 2017 and will increase to 60% in 2018. While qualified suppliers are allowed to import a relatively small portion of this requirement with minimal local processing, we are the only company currently qualified that can package and test these products locally. With the local content requirements for various IT products increasing, we believe that our local manufacturing capabilities provide a valuable and differentiated offering to our OEM customers in Brazil. We also believe that our long-term relationships with many of these customers as the largest supplier of locally manufactured memory products provides us with stability and visibility for our Brazilian business, as well as significant growth prospects.

In our specialty memory solutions business, we focus on providing extensive customer-specific design, manufacturing, technical support and value-added testing services that differ from the core focus of standard memory module providers. We collaborate closely with our global OEM customers throughout their design process and across multiple projects to create memory solutions for demanding applications with differentiated requirements, such as specific form factors, higher density, lower power, specific firmware or greater durability and reliability compared to standard memory modules. We target opportunities where we believe we can be a primary supplier of longer-lifecycle memory solutions to OEM customers for diverse and growing end markets within the networking, communications, storage, industrial, medical and automotive industries. In our specialty memory solutions business, we offer an extensive portfolio of over 2,000 products, which includes all generations of DRAM, as well as embedded and removable Flash, enterprise memory and hybrid volatile and non-volatile memory solutions. We also offer customized, integrated supply chain services to enable our customers to manage supply chain planning and execution, which reduces costs and increases productivity. Our supply chain services are based on our proprietary software platform that we develop and are integrated with our customers’ respective procurement management systems as well as our suppliers’ distribution management systems.
 We believe our close collaboration with customers, customer-specific designs, long-lifecycle solutions and proprietary supply chain services create significant customer attachment, allow us to identify new opportunities for growth and provide us with a high level of relative visibility and stability through macroeconomic cycles. Furthermore, we believe our business has relatively low capital expenditure requirements, and we have been able to leverage a flexible cost structure to maintain generally stable margins throughout market cycles. 
 We sell our solutions directly to a diversified base of global OEMs. Our top ten end customers, five of which have been our end customers for over a decade, accounted for 84% and 81% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our global sales channel consists of a direct sales force supported by a broad network of independent sales representatives located throughout North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. Our integrated sales process incorporates our direct sales force and customer service representatives and a high level of involvement from our senior executives. Our on-site field application engineers, or FAEs, collaborate with our OEM customers and provide us with insight into their product roadmaps, allowing us to identify opportunities to grow our business. The combination of our integrated sales network with our FAEs allows us to be more responsive to each customer’s unique requirements, enabling us to navigate the complex qualification processes at leading global OEMs. We believe our strong and often longstanding relationships with our customers reinforce our competitive position.
 Our Industry
 We believe that significant opportunities exist across the major markets in which our business operates due to the increasing global demand for existing and next generation memory technologies and OEM requirements for high quality and reliability backed by premium service and support. We believe that a number of trends are driving the expansion of our market opportunity in Brazil and elsewhere:
 Memory continues to be critical to system performance. With the growth in mobility, cloud computing and data intensive applications, the importance of and demand for memory continues to increase. Based on industry data, we believe that worldwide demand for DRAM and NAND Flash memory units will increase by over 110% and 350%, respectively, when comparing 2021 to 2016. The increasing diversity of demanding applications requires memory solutions tailored to meet these varying and growing needs. Memory density also continues to increase. We believe that 8Gb die will be the next leading DRAM density, which will drive DRAM bit growth. Based on industry data, we believe 8Gb die will account for 40% of worldwide DRAM bit shipments in 2017, up from 7% in 2015. Based on industry sources, we believe that 8Gb die will grow rapidly in 2018, with 8Gb die accounting for over 45% of worldwide DRAM bit shipments by 2018. Higher memory densities, lower power requirements and increasingly smaller form factors are especially important in mobile and embedded devices, where high performance and lower power consumption are critical.
 Stabilization of DRAM market. Industry consolidation, increased capital expenditure requirements, continued technology advancements and the shift in new production from DRAM to NAND have stabilized global DRAM supply and pricing in recent years. Furthermore, based on industry data, we estimate the top three DRAM suppliers to have over 90% of the worldwide market share in 2016. In addition, based on industry reports, we believe an 
 4


increase in worldwide DRAM demand is being driven by widening applications as usage of DRAM for smartphones is increasing along with worldwide consumption of DRAM for desktops, notebooks and servers. We believe this trend is expected to continue through at least 2021. Continuous advancements in process geometries require significant capital investments, making it difficult for new entrants and for existing suppliers to increase memory supply. Based on industry reports, while we expect DRAM unit consumption to be higher in 2021 than in 2016, we expect worldwide DRAM revenue for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 to be approximately $40 billion, $54 billion, $47 billion, $45 billion, $45 billion and $45 billion, respectively, which is a significant reduction in the historic volatility experienced in the DRAM market.
 Flash memory market continues to grow. Flash consumption is driven by the growth in demand for smartphones, solid state drives, or SSDs, for notebooks, servers and cloud computing, and other NAND based applications. Based on industry reports, we expect the worldwide NAND market will grow from approximately $32 billion in 2016 to $45 billion by 2021, representing approximately 7.0% CAGR.
 Increasing memory demand for smartphones in Brazil. Consumer demand for smartphones in Brazil is expected to grow, supported by the growing middle class, improvement in cellular and wireless infrastructure and current low levels of penetration of mobile devices. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the Brazilian middle class is expected to expand from 41% of the population, or 76 million people, in 2005, to 58% of the population, or 127 million people, by 2025. As a result, smartphone penetration is expected to increase. Based on industry reports, we expect sales of mobile phones in Brazil to reach 53.5 million units in 2018 (a 6.7% increase over 2016) and to grow to 56.0 million units in 2020, with smartphones sales expected to account for 50.0 million units in 2018 (a 12% increase over 2016) and 53.5 million units in 2020. We expect this increase in smartphone penetration to drive a corresponding increase in the demand for mobile memory components and modules.
 Increasing local content requirements in Brazil and other incentives. Local content requirements have been central to the Brazilian regulatory environment since the 1960s. These regulations are aimed at promoting job creation, sustaining economic growth and increasing the competitiveness of various domestic industries, and have helped enable a significant expansion of the Brazilian middle class. Local content requirements have been instrumental in the development of numerous key industries in Brazil, including automotive, oil and gas, aerospace, healthcare and IT. For example, local content regulation in Brazil’s automotive industry has helped the country become the world’s eighth largest automotive market and tenth largest producer of cars and commercial vehicles in 2016, according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. Once implemented, Brazil’s local content requirements have been generally maintained or increased over time. In 2012, regulations were passed that require that automotive companies perform certain manufacturing activities in Brazil, and the granting of tax relief is conditioned on the amount of local content applied within the manufacturing process.
 In the IT industry, government programs have been introduced to incentivize manufacturers to establish and expand their operations in Brazil and to incentivize OEMSs to purchase locally manufactured components for their products.
  
• | Lei da Informática—Processo Produtivo Básico (PPB/IT Program), 1991: Provides for significant tax benefits for companies that develop or produce computing and automation goods locally and invest in IT-related research and development in Brazil. The PPB/IT Program requirements for local content are published publicly on a periodic basis and typically include the requirements for the three to four-year period following publication. The PPB/IT Program requirements for local manufacturing are published publicly on a periodic basis and typically include the requirements for the three to four-year period following publication. The PPB/IT Program requirements for locally sourced memory components from calendar years 2008 to 2019 are set forth below.

 OEMs that are PPB/IT Program-compliant and who fulfill the above local content requirements receive substantial benefits, including a reduction in excise taxes on their purchases from qualified suppliers as well as a reduction in taxes that they are required to charge on sales to their end customers. We estimate that the aggregate of the PPB/IT Program-related benefits is around 28% of the resale value of the OEM’s end products. These tax benefits provide a strong incentive for OEMs to purchase products from local content manufacturers such as us. Local content requirements for mobile memory products for smartphones increased from 20% in 2015 to 50% in 2017 and are expected to increase to 60% in 2018.
 Other tax incentives introduced to incentivize manufacturers to establish and expand their operations in Brazil, include the following:
  
• | Lei do Bem, 2005: Fosters technology innovation in Brazil by providing a reduction in corporate income tax through allowance of expenses related to research and development activities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support Program for the Technological Development of the Semiconductor and Display Industries (PADIS), 2007, extended in 2016: Awards incentives and provides significant tax relief, including reductions in the Brazilian aggregate statutory income tax rates, to semiconductor and display companies that invest in research and development and that promote the development, design, test and packaging processes in Brazil. Furthermore, combining PADIS and PPB/IT Program-compliance provides additional financial incentives to OEMs that purchase modules containing components that are locally processed from wafers.

 In 2013, the European Union, or EU, later joined by Japan, requested the establishment of a panel within the World Trade Organization, or WTO, to determine whether certain measures enacted by the Brazilian government concerning tax incentives and local content requirements for the automotive and several other industries including the IT industry and including PADIS, the PPB/IT Program and Lei do Bem, are inconsistent with WTO rules. In December 2016, the WTO circulated its report to the parties. This report was released to the public on August 30, 2017. In its report, the panel concluded, among other things, that the tax exemptions, reductions and suspensions granted for the automotive, IT and other industries amount to subsidies that are inconsistent with the principles of the various WTO agreements, and the panel recommended that Brazil withdraw these subsidies. Government officials in Brazil have expressed their intent, if necessary, to restructure the incentives to be consistent with the WTO principles and to continue to support local industry, however, there can be no assurance that the programs will 
 6


ultimately be restructured and implemented or, if implemented, whether the restructured programs will provide the same level of support as is currently in place. Brazil has notified the WTO of its decision to appeal the panel’s findings. While we cannot predict the impact of the WTO’s report, this recommendation could result in significant adverse changes to the local content rules and incentives available to us and our customers in Brazil. Any suspension, early termination or other adverse change in the local content requirements could significantly reduce the demand for, and the profit margins on, our products in Brazil, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe our core competitive strengths include:
 Strong presence in Brazil. We are the largest local manufacturer of DRAM components and DRAM modules for the desktop, notebook and server markets in Brazil as measured by market share. We are also the first company to develop manufacturing capabilities for Flash-based products in Brazil, where we are the leading manufacturer of mobile memory products, such as mobile DRAM, eMMC and eMCP. We benefit from having a first mover advantage in Brazil (having invested over $170 million in the country since 2002 to build and improve our advanced manufacturing facilities) and understand government initiatives and how to navigate regulatory requirements to benefit our company and our customers. We believe we are well positioned to maintain our established leadership in Brazil’s memory market and to extend our leadership in the growing mobile memory market.
 Our experience in Brazil has helped us develop expertise in semiconductor technology and advanced manufacturing that allows us to be a trusted local supplier to OEMs. We have demonstrated our ability to produce solutions with shrinking geometries and increasing complexity. In addition, we benefit from a strategic wafer supply relationship that has provided us with a strong, continuous supply of competitively priced wafers for use in the local market. Through this relationship, our collaboration on technology and processes with key suppliers and our continued capital investment, we strive to maintain our advanced manufacturing capabilities and operate at a high level of efficiency with capabilities and scale that are difficult for a competitor to replicate. We have also made significant investments in assembling and training a staff of over 480 employees who comprise many of the leading semiconductor technology professionals in the country.
 Well positioned to benefit from Brazilian local content regulations. Increasing local content requirements for local manufacturing help drive our growth strategy in Brazil. For example, local content requirements for mobile memory products for smartphones increased from 20% in 2015 to 50% in 2017 and is expected to increase to 60% in 2018. While qualified suppliers are allowed to import a relatively small portion of this requirement with minimal local processing, we are the only company currently qualified that can package and test these products locally. Global suppliers of memory components and modules not manufactured in Brazil cannot address the local content purchasing requirements of OEM customers selling products in Brazil. As a result of our infrastructure, scale and capabilities in Brazil, we have a significant advantage in being able to satisfy these local content requirements.
 Business model focused on specialized markets and strong customer collaboration. The complexity of applications today requires sophisticated memory solutions with a high degree of specialization and customization to fulfill the requirements of OEMs. In specialty memory, we focus on opportunities in markets that feature products with longer life cycles (typically five to seven years), specialized form factors and customized firmware which typically require intensive and time consuming qualification processes and create high switching costs for our customers. Our research and development teams are closely aligned with our customers, and this collaboration enables early stage adoption of our solutions and significant visibility into our customers’ product roadmaps. Our global supply chain services also foster further customer attachment. Our high level of collaboration and integration with our customers make it difficult, costly and time consuming for them to switch to an alternative supplier.
 Global footprint and delivery network. We are located near many of our largest customers and their manufacturing partners around the world, offering extensive global manufacturing, engineering and supply chain management capabilities. We have three manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Brazil and Malaysia; eight facilities with engineering and research and development operations located in five countries; and employees located in nine countries across the world. Our established global network of component sources helps to ensure that our pricing remains competitive and that we are able to provide a stable source of supply for our customers.

Advanced manufacturing capabilities. We have invested in facilities and processes tailored to meet the exacting demands and specialized requirements of our OEM customers while maintaining a high level of efficiency, quality and productivity. Our advanced processes enable us to provide quick turnaround to meet our customer demands. Our extensive quality control programs and sophisticated test capabilities help to ensure a low defect rate and, for markets that require it, we offer reliability testing and screening substantially above standard industry practices. Our advanced manufacturing capabilities and processes are International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 9001:2008, 14001:2004 and Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, or OHSAS, 18001:2007 compliant, and our manufacturing facilities have been audited for compliance with the standards of the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition, or EICC, which is increasingly a requirement of major global OEMs.
 Flexible operating model. We believe our operating model has enabled us to maintain margins that are more stable than those of many of the largest memory manufacturers, as such memory manufacturers own their own wafer fabs which are extremely costly to build. Our advanced manufacturing capabilities are focused on packaging and test of ICs after they are produced in wafer form at a wafer fab. As we do not own or operate our own wafer fabs, we have low capital expenditures relative to semiconductor manufacturers. Our business also is characterized by low fixed costs. Both factors have helped us maintain generally stable margins through market cycles.
 Ability to manage complex supply chains at scale. Our need to manage complex supply chains helped us develop our proprietary software platform, utilized by a team of dedicated professionals to meet the specific needs of our customers. We integrate our proprietary software platform with our customers’ procurement management as well as our suppliers’ distribution management systems to enable supply chain planning and execution, which lowers costs and increases efficiency. We believe this ability to manage complex supply chains at scale helps our customers minimize inventory levels while ensuring timely supply of material.
 Proven management team with history of execution. We have an experienced and long-serving senior management team with an average tenure of approximately 18 years. The management team has a successful track record of operating the business through many market cycles and industry changes. Our senior management team has deep relationships throughout the sector and extensive knowledge of the global memory market as well as the Brazilian IT industry and regulatory environment.
 Our Strategy
 Our goals are to further strengthen our leadership position in the design, manufacture and supply of specialty memory solutions for leading OEMs and to pursue opportunities for growth in existing and new markets. We are pursuing the following strategies to achieve our goals: 
 Maintain our existing leadership in Brazil and enhance our manufacturing capabilities. We plan to continue to invest in our Brazilian desktop, notebook and server DRAM businesses to ensure that we are well positioned to maintain our leadership in these markets. We are enhancing our manufacturing capabilities to meet the increasing technological requirements of improved and new generations of DRAM devices needed to address the demand for our memory products manufactured in Brazil. We expect these enhancements to enable us to improve efficiencies, increase yields and advance our competitive position in our core DRAM businesses.
 Capture growing mobile memory market in Brazil. We expect to continue to leverage our experience and success in our desktop, notebook and server DRAM business to capitalize upon high-growth markets for mobile memory. We will seek to grow our market share with OEMs that are currently utilizing imported mobile memory components to manufacture smartphones in Brazil, as local content requirements for mobile memory components, such as eMMC, eMCP and mobile DRAM, increased from 40% in 2016 to 50% in 2017 and will increase to 60% in 2018. In December 2013 and again in December 2014, one of our subsidiaries in Brazil obtained financing from BNDES to purchase capital equipment and invest in further expansion of our operations in Brazil. We utilized much of the proceeds from the BNDES Agreements to purchase capital equipment and expand our manufacturing capabilities to capture growth opportunities in the mobile memory market. We believe our investments in infrastructure, customer relationships and broad set of solutions position us to capitalize on growing mobile memory demand and increasing local content requirements.

Maintain our leadership in specialty memory. We intend to remain a leader among specialty memory suppliers. We will continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions to help our customers improve functionality, enhance their supply chain, reduce costs and accelerate their time-to-market. To ensure we can meet the demands of our existing customers, we will continue to invest in research and development, our facilities and our workforce, especially as our new product offerings in DDR4 and embedded Flash memory continue to ramp.
 Expand our total addressable market by offering innovative new products and by capitalizing on new market opportunities. We intend to leverage our experience and capabilities to launch new products and expand into new markets. We believe this will allow us to further penetrate our existing customers as well as increase the number of customers that we serve. Our strategy is based on providing specialized products that require levels of service and support that larger semiconductor manufacturers often do not provide. As part of this strategy, we introduced eMMC products for networking, communications, industrial and medical markets, where we expect strong growth for eMMC solutions. We believe that our long-term customer and supplier relationships provide a key advantage in gaining entry into new markets. In addition, we recently added memory solutions for SmartTVs to our product offerings in Brazil. We plan to continue investing in innovation in strategic areas, such as Flash and solid state storage and the evolving technology transition to DDR4.
 Expand our global coverage. Devices and applications using memory are required in every region of the world, requiring OEMs to maintain a global supply chain to meet that demand. In addition to the United States and Brazil, we plan to increase our presence internationally and target new OEM and original design manufacturer, or ODM, customers in Europe and Asia.

These memory modules come in configurations of up to 288 pins and densities of up to 128 gigabytes. We utilize advanced printed circuit board and device packaging/stacking technologies to achieve cost-effective high-density solutions. We also develop specialized memory module designs based on specific OEM requirements. We employ extensive software based electrical and thermal simulations in the design of DDR, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4 DIMMs and test those designs on high-end functional testers utilizing a broad set of test suites. These products are designed to meet the quality requirements of enterprise class systems pursuant to stringent specifications required by various high speed applications described above.
 Flash
 In Brazil, we have in the past three years begun to process Flash wafers to manufacture eMMC and eMCP products to address the markets for mobile products in Brazil, including smartphones.
 In our specialty memory solutions business, we design and manufacture Flash memory products in a variety of form factors and capacities. Our wide range of Flash memory products includes CompactFlash, SD/micro SD Cards and PCIe configurations. We also offer USB products in removal key and embedded configurations, and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment, or SATA, products in mSATA, SATA Slim, iSATA, uSATA, M.2 and 2.5” form factors. Our Flash modules are predominantly used in communications equipment, aerospace, automotive, industrial, defense, printers, servers and storage, switches and routers. Additionally, we are developing a line of eMMCs to address industrial, medical and networking specialty memory markets.
 Supply Chain Services
 We also offer supply chain services, including procurement, logistics, inventory management, temporary warehousing, programming, kitting and packaging services. We tailor our supply chain service offerings to meet the specific needs of our customers to enable our customers to manage supply chain planning and execution, which reduces costs and increases productivity. Our supply chain services are based on our proprietary software platform that we develop, which are then integrated with our customers’ respective procurement management systems as well as our suppliers’ distribution management systems. Our global footprint allows us to provide these services to our customers and their manufacturing partners in many regions of the world. Our global inventory management capabilities allow us to manage a vast array of customer and supplier part numbers across our worldwide manufacturing and logistics hubs, helping our customers minimize inventory levels while maintaining reliable delivery and availability of supply. In fiscal 2017, we processed over 1.9 million transactions with an aggregate value of $0.9 billion. We believe that our close collaboration with customers on proprietary supply chain services increases the switching costs and the level of attachment of our specialty memory customers.

Manufacturing and Test
 Manufacturing
 We have manufacturing facilities in Atibaia, Brazil; Newark, California; and Penang, Malaysia. Our manufacturing facilities have been ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007 certified. Additionally, we are a member of the EICC, and our manufacturing facilities are compliant with the EICC Code of Conduct, which is increasingly a business requirement of global OEM customers. We believe that our manufacturing operations have benefited from our many years of design experience and our existing library of proven designs which stress high manufacturability and quality. Over 25 years of manufacturing experience enables us to quickly move from manufacturing initiation to full production volumes of new products which is paramount in helping our customers achieve rapid time-to-market for their new product introductions. As a result of our design efficiencies, high level of automation and expertise in utilizing advanced manufacturing processes, we achieve high manufacturing yields and reduced direct labor costs and offer our customers quick turnaround of both small and large production orders, which is a key factor in enabling our build-to-order model.
 While we do not own or operate wafer fabs, we have capabilities for subsequent stages of the product manufacturing cycle. Our manufacturing capabilities in Brazil consist of receiving unmounted ICs in wafer form from third-party wafer fabs, preparing and packaging the ICs into semiconductor components, testing the components, and in some cases placing these components on substrates or printed circuit boards to make modules or multi-chip packages. Our advanced manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to become the largest local manufacture of DRAM components and DRAM modules for the desktop, notebook and server markets in Brazil, as measured by market share. In recent years, we have expanded our manufacturing capabilities to enable us to manufacture mobile DRAM components and products as well as to process Flash wafers to manufacture NAND components. We also manufacture various Flash-based products, including eMCP and eMMC products.Through our investments and experience in Brazil, we have developed expertise in semiconductor technology and advanced manufacturing that allows us to manufacture products with shrinking geometries and increasing complexity. We continue to make significant capital investments to expand our manufacturing capabilities and operate at a high level of efficiency.
 Test
 Product testing is an important aspect of our manufacturing operations and we believe that we have established substantial technical expertise in the testing of products for high-end applications. Our extensive testing capabilities not only help to ensure a low defect rate, but they also enable us, in certain situations, to sell specialized testing as an additional service. We test our products for full functionality and we design customer specific testing processes that differ from the core focus of standard memory module providers. We have achieved stringent quality targets across a broad spectrum of system applications and customer-specific designs. Our staff includes experienced test engineers who have developed proprietary testing routines and parameters which, combined with our advanced test equipment, enable us to diagnose problems in components as well as in system design, and enable us to characterize the performance of new products and to provide high quality products in volume.
 We employ extensive software-based electrical and thermal simulations in the design of DDR, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4 modules and test those designs on high-end functional testers utilizing a broad set of test suites. These tests are designed to meet the quality requirements of enterprise class systems pursuant to stringent specifications required by various high speed applications. We also conduct design verification testing of hardware and firmware as well as system integration and reliability testing. We work to continually improve our test routines and associated software and have recently developed a high-volume, fully automated reliability testing and screening capability substantially beyond standard industry practices that enables us to reduce the occurrence of early life failures and weak module fallout which can save our customers from the often significant expenses associated with replacing products that fail after their field deployment.
 Customers
 Our principal end customers include global OEMs that compete in the computing, networking, communications, storage, aerospace, defense, mobile and industrial markets. Overall, we served more than 250 end customers in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales to our ten largest end customers (including sales to contract manufacturers or ODMs at the direction of such end customers) accounted for 84%, 81% and 75% of net 
 11


sales, respectively. Of our end customers, Samsung accounted for 19%, 13% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017,  2016 and 2015, respectively; Cisco accounted for 15%, 19% and 16% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; Lenovo accounted for 11% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; Dell accounted for 15% of net sales in fiscal 2015; and HP accounted for 14% of net sales in fiscal 2015 (in fiscal 2016, HP undertook a spin-off and divided into two distinct companies, following which neither company accounted for 10% or more of our net sales). Direct sales to Samsung accounted for 19%, 13% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; direct sales to Flex accounted for 14% and 17% of net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; direct sales to Hon Hai accounted for 13%, 11% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and direct sales to Dell accounted for 15% of net sales in fiscal 2015. During these periods, no other customers accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. Our longstanding relationship with Cisco, spanning approximately 20 years, exists within multiple business units and engineering organizations within Cisco. Our products are manufactured on a build-to-order basis for OEMs. Our sales are made primarily pursuant to customer purchase orders and are not based on long-term supply agreements. Most of our business is on a purchase order basis; accordingly, we have limited backlog and we do not believe our backlog is material or indicative of anticipated net sales.
 Suppliers
 To address the needs of our customers, we have developed and maintained relationships with leading semiconductor suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Our semiconductor suppliers include many of the world’s largest memory manufacturers including Samsung, Micron, SK Hynix and Toshiba. We frequently work jointly with our suppliers in bidding for customers’ design-in opportunities. We also work closely with our suppliers to better ensure that materials are available and delivered on time. Our established global network of component sources helps to ensure that our pricing remains competitive and that we are able to provide a stable source of supply for our customers.
 We believe that our longstanding relationships with leading suppliers put us in a favorable position to procure sufficient quantities of materials, including during periods of industry shortages. Our flexible and responsive global manufacturing capabilities, inventory management systems and global IT system allow us to cost-effectively move materials from one site to another and often deploy what might otherwise be excess inventory among other products and OEM customers. We purchase almost all of our materials, including wafers used in our memory products in Brazil, from our suppliers on a purchase order basis and generally do not have long-term commitments from suppliers.
 Sales, Support and Marketing
 We primarily sell our products directly to global OEMs through our direct sales force located across North America, Latin America, Asia and Europe. Our sales and marketing efforts are conducted through an integrated process incorporating our direct sales force, customer service representatives and our FAEs with a network of independent sales representatives. Our sales and marketing efforts also include a high level of involvement from our senior executives. Larger OEM customers are also often supported by dedicated sales and support teams. As of August 25, 2017, we had 57 sales and marketing personnel worldwide.
 Our on-site FAEs work closely with our sales team to provide product design support to our OEM customers. Our FAEs collaborate closely with our OEM customers, providing us with insight into their product roadmaps and allowing us to identify opportunities at an early stage to help grow our business. The combination of our integrated sales network with our FAEs enables us to be more responsive and successful in navigating through each customer’s unique and oftentimes complex design qualification process. 
 Our marketing activities include advertising in technical journals, publishing articles in leading industry periodicals and utilizing direct email solicitation. In addition to these marketing activities, we also participate in many industry trade shows worldwide. We have active memberships in industry organizations such as the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council, or JEDEC, the USB Implementers Forum, the SD Card Association, the Storage Networking Industry Association, the CompactFlash Association, and Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group, or PCI-SIG.

Research and Development
 The timely development of new products is essential to maintaining our competitive position. Our research and development activities are conducted primarily at our research and development centers in Newark and Irvine, California; Atibaia, Brazil; Penang, Malaysia; Gilbert, Arizona; Seongnam-City, South Korea; and Tewksbury, Massachusetts. In 2013 we opened a new research and development center in New Taipei City, Taiwan. Our research and development activities are focused on driving innovation in our products as well as continuous process improvement for our procurement and manufacturing. Our product development includes innovations for next generation DRAM products, mobile DRAM, hybrid memories such as hybrid volatile and non-volatile DRAM or NVDIMM, enterprise memory, and many Flash-based products, such as eMMC and eMCP. We plan to continue to devote research and development efforts to the innovation and design of these and other new products which address the requirements of our customers, especially for growing markets for DRAM and Flash mobile memory products, such as mobile and automotive.
 We are developing a broad offering of Flash-based products targeting the automotive, industrial, medical, communications, mobile and networking markets. In order to enhance our efforts to develop innovative Flash products, we have increased our engineering resources significantly, including opening our research and development center in New Taipei City in 2013, where our engineering team is dedicated to firmware development, systems engineering and integration, system and platform validation and applications, and product and reliability engineering for new Flash memory products, including our eMMC product. In addition, in order to take advantage of local regulations and government incentive programs for the growing mobile memory market in Brazil, we have invested substantial financial and management resources to expand our Brazilian research and development capabilities to enable us to develop a broad offering of Flash-based products for the local market.
 Our advanced engineering and design capabilities allow us to address our customers’ increasingly complex needs. We design our products to be compatible with existing industry standards and, where appropriate, develop and promote new standards or provide custom solutions to meet customers’ requirements. An important aspect of our research and development effort is understanding the challenges presented by our customers’ requirements and addressing them by utilizing our industry knowledge, proprietary technologies and technical expertise. By working closely with our customers and suppliers, we are able to deliver technically advanced products designed to meet customer-specific needs with competitive solutions to satisfy our customers’ memory and storage requirements, shorten their time-to-market and enhance the performance of our customers’ end products.
 We spent $38.2 million, $38.1 million and $43.7 million on research and development in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of August 25, 2017, we had 131 research and development personnel worldwide.
 Competition
 We primarily compete against global and local memory module providers, and to a lesser extent, large semiconductor memory IC manufacturers that utilize a portion of their capacity to manufacture memory modules. The principal competitive factors in our markets include the ability to meet customer-specific requirements and provide high product quality, strong technical support, technologically advanced products and services, advanced testing capabilities, flexible and global delivery options, reliable supply and reasonable pricing. Our principal competitors include:

• | Providers of specialty memory products, including Viking Technology (a division of Sanmina Corporation), or Viking Technology, ATP Electronics, Inc., or ATP, Unigen Corporation, or Unigen, Apacer Technology, Inc., or Apacer, and Transcend Information, Inc., or Transcend;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Brazil, local manufacturers of DRAM modules and Flash products and local manufacturers of memory ICs, including HT Micron Semicondutores Ltda., or HT Micron;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Semiconductor memory integrated circuit, or IC, manufacturers that also manufacture DRAM modules and Flash products, including Samsung, Micron Technology, Inc., or Micron, Western Digital Corporation, or Western Digital, SK Hynix, Inc., or SK Hynix, and Toshiba Corporation, or Toshiba; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In our supply chain services business, a broad set of companies, including distributors and third party logistics providers as well as our customers’ in-house solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of our global competitors are large international companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as greater name recognition and longer-standing relationships with customers and suppliers than we do. In contrast with our focus on specialty memory products with high levels of service and support, these competitors are generally focused on high-volume memory and storage products that are manufactured to industry standard specifications, and they have limited customization and service capabilities.
 In addition, some of our competitors are also our suppliers or customers. See “Item A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Sales to a limited number of customers represents a significant portion of our net sales, and the loss of any key customer or key program, or the demands of our key customers, could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition” and “—Our dependence on a small number of sole or limited source suppliers subjects us to certain risks, including the risk that we may be unable to obtain adequate supplies at a reasonable price and in a timely manner.”
 In Brazil, our competitors are generally much smaller in scale than we are in terms of revenue and capabilities for manufacturing and for research and development. To a lesser degree, we compete with companies that import DRAM and Flash components and products. We believe that import duties and local content requirements in Brazil give us an advantage over these companies. As the local market grows, competition may increase in Brazil.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, copyright and, to a lesser extent, patents to protect our intellectual property rights. As of September 26, 2017, we have 30 issued patents, including 29 patents issued in the United States and one patent issued in South Korea, expiring between 2022 and 2036, excluding any additional patent term for patent term adjustments. In addition, we have 30 patent applications pending, including 16 patent applications in the United States, seven patent applications in Brazil, five patent applications in Malaysia, one patent application in South Korea, and one patent application in Argentina. We also own a number of trademark registrations, including registrations in the United States for the word marks MHUB and SMART MODULAR TECHNOLOGIES and for our stylized “S” logo in combination with the word SMART and, in Brazil, registrations for our stylized “S” logo.  
 While many of our products contain proprietary aspects, the majority of our products are built to meet industry standards, such as those set by JEDEC, the standards-setting organization for the semiconductor industry. The absence of patent protection for most of our products means that we cannot prevent our competitors from reverse-engineering and duplicating those products. Much of our intellectual property is know-how and trade secrets, and often we rely on the technological skills and innovation of our personnel rather than on patent protection. We believe that our continued success depends largely on our customer relationships, manufacturing and support capabilities and the technical expertise we have developed in manufacturing and designing products, and we rely on trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements to protect this aspect of our business.
 Employees
 As of August 25, 2017, we had 1,169 full-time employees.
 Our employee relations in Brazil are subject to Brazilian labor laws and regulations as well as collective bargaining arrangements that are negotiated every year. Four of these collective bargaining agreements are specific to our company while there are other collective bargaining agreements that are generally applicable to certain segments of the electronics industry. The applicable labor laws and regulations, as well as the collective bargaining agreements, principally relate to matters such as formal working time compensation, paid annual vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday and payments for overtime, profit sharing and severance. Although a very small number of our employees in Brazil are members of a labor union, all employees in Brazil are represented by the unions for labor and employment matters.
 We have never experienced a work stoppage in any of our locations worldwide, and we consider our employee relations to be good.

Brazilian Local Content Requirements and Other Regulatory Issues
 Brazilian Local Content Requirements
 We expect to continue to invest both in maintaining our leadership position, as measured by market share, in our core Brazilian desktop, notebook and server DRAM businesses and in positioning ourselves to be a leading provider in Brazil for mobile DRAM and Flash memory products. We further expect that local content requirements as well as other government incentive programs in Brazil will help drive our growth strategies, as significant incentives exist to promote the development of the local IT industry. In Brazil, we participate in three government investment incentive programs.

• | PPB/IT Program, 1991: Provides for significant relief from various tax provisions for companies that develop or produce computing and automation goods and invest in IT-related research and development in Brazil. OEMs that are PPB/IT Program-compliant and who fulfill the local content requirements receive substantial benefits including a reduction in excise taxes on their purchases from qualified suppliers as well as a reduction in the taxes that they are required to charge on sales to their end customers. We estimate that the aggregate of the PPB/IT Program-related tax benefits can range from 15% to as high as 36% of the resale value of the OEMs’ end products. These tax benefits are a strong incentive for OEMs to purchase products from local content manufacturers such as SMART Brazil, our Brazilian operating subsidiary.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lei do Bem, 2005: Fosters technology innovation in Brazil by providing a reduction in corporate income tax through the allowance of deductions for expenses related to research and development activities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PADIS, 2007, extended in 2016: Awards incentives and significant tax relief, including reductions in the Brazilian aggregate statutory income tax rates, to semiconductor and display companies that invest in research and development and that promote the development, design, test and packaging processes in Brazil. Furthermore, combining PADIS with PPB/IT Program-compliance provides additional financial incentives to OEMs that purchase modules that contain components that are locally processed from wafers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As the leading local manufacturer of desktop, notebook and server DRAM modules and DRAM components as well as DRAM and Flash mobile memory products in Brazil, as measured by market share, we benefit substantially from these incentives and local content requirements. A cancellation, reduction or other adverse change in any of these incentives or local content requirements, or our failure to meet these requirements, could have a substantial negative impact on our tax rates and could significantly reduce the demand for, and the profit margins on, our products in Brazil.
 In 2013, the EU, later joined by Japan, requested the establishment of a panel within the WTO to determine whether certain measures enacted by the Brazilian government concerning tax incentives and local content requirements for the automotive and several other industries including the IT industry and including PADIS, the PPB/IT Program and Lei do Bem, are inconsistent with WTO rules. In December 2016, the WTO circulated its report to the parties. This report was released to the public on August 30, 2017. In its report, the panel concluded, among other things, that the tax exemptions, reductions and suspensions granted for the automotive, IT and other industries amount to subsidies that are inconsistent with the principles of the various WTO agreements, and the panel recommended that Brazil withdraw these subsidies. Government officials in Brazil have expressed their intent, if necessary, to restructure the incentives to be consistent with the WTO principles and to continue to support local industry, however, there can be no assurance that the programs will ultimately be restructured and implemented or, if implemented, whether the restructured programs will provide the same level of support as is currently in place. Brazil has notified the WTO of its decision to appeal the panel’s findings. While we cannot predict the impact of the WTO’s report, this recommendation could result in significant adverse changes to the local content rules and incentives available to us and our customers in Brazil. Any suspension, early termination or other adverse change in the local content requirements could significantly reduce the demand for, and the profit margins on, our products in Brazil, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 15


Environmental Regulations
 Our operations and properties are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes, reverse logistics (take-back policy) and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. The presence of lead in quantities not believed to be significant have been found in the ground under one of the multi-tenant buildings we lease in Brazil. While we did not cause the contamination, we may be held responsible if remediation is required, although we may be entitled to seek indemnification from responsible parties under Brazilian law and from our lessor under our lease. We cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory agencies, enactment of more stringent laws and regulations or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and cause additional material liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
