Item 1. Business
Overview of Market
 
Founded in 1979, Information Analysis Incorporated, which we sometimes refer to as the Company or IAI, is in the business of developing and maintaining information technology (IT) systems, modernizing client information systems, and performing other IT-related professional services to government and commercial organizations. Since IAI's inception, we have performed software development and conversion projects for over 100 commercial and government customers including, but not limited to, the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Treasury, U.S. Small Business Administration, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, Department of Veterans Affairs, and General Dynamics Information Technology (formerly Computer Sciences Corporation, CSRA). At present, we primarily apply our technology, services and experience to legacy software migration and modernization, developing web-based and mobile device solutions, including dynamic electronic forms development and conversion, data analytics, and we are in the process of acquiring talent and expertise in developing cybersecurity and cloud services practices.
Cloud Solutions Marketplace
 
The cybersecurity and cloud solutions markets continue to be among the fastest growing segments of the information technology professional services business as small and large companies, and state and federal government agencies are rapidly expanding their presence and reach through cloud implementations. The range of products and services involved in this sector is extensive. Complex web applications generally require knowledge of customers’ back-end systems based on mainframe or mid-level computers. Few small companies have the expertise to develop these more sophisticated web applications. We distinguish ourselves among smaller companies by having such expertise, typically associated with larger companies, both internally and through strategic business relationships with leading-edge software firms.

Information Collection and Dissemination
 
Given executive level directives to improve outreach to its stakeholders, federal and state government agencies are now empowered to find means of facilitating dissemination of information quickly and efficiently. Government requirements are unique in that most government processes are based on forms. Many government agencies rely on thousands of internal and external forms to conduct their business. Forms usage within the federal government is also subject to Section 508 and its related accessibility requirements for information and communications technology.  Of particular concern are PDF documents, which need special remediation due to not generally being accessible by screen readers.  PDF's are the predominant format for forms in the federal government, and we support several agencies in Section 508 PDF remediation through our solutions partnership with Adobe Systems.
 
The U.S. federal government has been employing more form data entry and citizen communication using mobile devices such as iPhones, iPads, and mobile devices employing the Android and other operating systems. Working with Adobe’s latest versions of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), we have been able to build applications for several federal clients employing mobile devices, as well as converting paper-based forms into “dynamic” or “adaptive” forms.
 
Legacy Migration and Modernization
 
The migration and modernization market is complex and diverse. Many large legacy systems remain in use because of the enormous cost to re-engineer these systems. Typically, these legacy systems have been patched and modified without adequate documentation for decades and utilize multiple reporting applications and methods used to recall the information contained within the systems. Currently, the options available to modernize these systems are many and include introduction of new hardware systems, employing advanced software languages, and utilization of the Internet or Intranet to achieve desired efficiencies. All of these options are often very expensive and time consuming because they require starting all over in defining requirements, designing structures, programming, and testing.
 
Opportunities for our modernization expertise continue to exist as government agencies and private companies are being driven to modernize for various reasons.  One major reason is the increasing difficulty of finding and retaining staff with technical skills in outdated but in-use programming languages.  Many senior programmers who possess these skills are nearing retirement.  Another driving factor is the increased funding by federal and state legislatures to address the upgrading of their legacy systems. Hardware platforms such as Unisys are reaching the horizon of their usefulness, and consequently, older programming and data base languages are generally poorly supported by their providers. Maintenance costs are materially increasing as vendors squeeze the most out of clients before the life-cycles of hardware and software expire. The inherent stability of these legacy systems and the costs of modernizing them through traditional methods have been barriers to decision-makers executing on the modernizations, but the increases in resources needed and the decrease in resources available to support these legacy systems will continue to force the issue. In addition, the Internet has added a new level of pressure to compete in the electronic marketplace with sector rivals. Ove the next decade, we expect organizations to be under increasing pressure revamp their older legacy systems.
 
A segment of mainframe users is interested in simply updating their legacy systems without drastic rewritings to these systems in newer languages or adapting expensive enterprise products (such as SAP or Oracle) to their needs. These potential customers are looking for automated tools that can quickly and cost-effectively move applications onto cheaper computer platforms without the risk of failure. IAI, in conjunction with strategic partners, such as Micro Focus and Software Mining, offers its own conversion tool set and those of our partners in addressing this need and positioning us to uniquely deliver successful results. It is difficult to determine the exact size of this segment, but even a minor share of this market would represent significant prospective customers with meaningful opportunities.
 
IAI was a major partner in the successful modernization effort of the SBA's 504 loan program through 2017 and 2018, and we are currently working with those same partners on another large effort at the SBA.
 
Because of IAI’s unique modernization capabilities, IAI has been a preferred small business partner to some key large systems integrators.

Description of Business and Strategy
 
Our traditional areas of services offerings revolve around legacy system modernization, dynamic and adaptive forms creation and data collections, Section 508 compliance on fillable and savable PDF’s and web-based forms, and development of applications revolving around data collection, including the Department of Homeland Security’s Parking and Transit Subsidy Application Tool and the Department of Veteran’s Affairs’ intelligent adaptive 10-10EZ multi-platform application.
 
For several years we have been aligned with Micro Focus, an established company in the legacy COBOL environment, to jointly participate in the conversion of large legacy mainframe systems to PC and Unix server platforms.  Micro Focus has developed a suite of products that simplify the conversion process and enable the entry screens to be Internet accessible.  We use these Micro Focus tools in conjunction with our proprietary ICONS suite of conversion tools to perform legacy platform modernizations with a speed and efficiency that sets us apart from most competitors in the legacy modernization market. The diverse capabilities of our staff in mainframe technology and client-server implementations help to assure that our staff can analyze the original systems properly to conduct accurate and thorough conversions both from a technical and a business perspective. Our modernization methodology has evolved over time through the successful completion of numerous conversion projects.
 
Our strategy to exploit the conversion and modernization market is also predicated on continuing to form alliances with large information technology consulting firms and systems integrators who currently maintain the legacy systems for large government agencies and Fortune 1000 companies. These strategic alliances have resulted in significant opportunities in the past and are likely to be important in procuring future business.
 
We are using the experience we have acquired as an Adobe solutions partner and reseller to help secure engagements for web-based applications requiring forms. The Adobe Experience Manager products have evolved over the years into robust tools that can form the backbone of applications, especially those requiring forms and web content management. We have used this expertise to penetrate a number of federal government clients such as the Internal Revenue Service and Veterans Affairs and build sophisticated web applications at the Department of Homeland Security. One such application, a parking and transit subsidy tool, was cited for award recognition by the American Council for Technology – Industry Advisory Council (ACT-IAC) and Federal Computer Week’s Fed 100 Awards. Our knowledge of legacy system languages has been instrumental in connecting these web applications to legacy databases residing on mainframe computers. Our Company has built a core group of professionals that can continue to build this practice over the coming years. In addition, IAI, operating as a prime contractor, has teamed with Adobe Systems to provide AEM Assets govCloud services to DoD’s Defense Security Services and AEM related application consulting to the Defense Finance and Accounting Services.
 
We recognize the need to enhance our service and product capabilities as a means of expanding our business base and maintaining growth in the future. We are broadening our range of third-party applications and products to include cloud services, artificial intellingence and robotics process automation, and cybersecurity products, for which we offer implementation, design, and customization services.  We are strengthening our human capital by acquiring the talent and expertise we need to offer the best and most secure solutions tailored to each client.

Where appropriate, we have entered into teaming arrangements or product reseller agreements with certain of these firms. These products and services are synergistic to our present business strategy and also allow us to expand into new business areas, both within the federal government and commercial sectors, without the expenditure of significant technical development dollars. Our partners benefit by our potential to leverage their new technology developments into our existing client base, as well as utilize our expertise and credibility in developing applications around their inventive products.
 
We are a small business team member on the Defense Logistics Agency’s (DLA) J6 Enterprise Technical Services (JETS) contract. The DLA JETS contract is a five-year, $6.015B ceiling, base Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle for a full range of IT services as well as technical and management expertise that supports applications, software, hardware, infrastructure, and systems, across the DLA Enterprise. Additionally, this contract vehicle is available for use by other Department of Defense agencies and organizations.
 
We offer many of our services as an individual company under a Multiple Award Schedule for information technology through the General Services Administration.  We are pursuing several other IDIQ contract vehicles and Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) through partnerships and individually.  These types of contract vehicles facilitate the award process for several U.S. federal agencies by establishing a comapny's qualifications and other factors specific to the vehicle, and many requests for proposals are issued under specific contract vehicles.
 
Backlog
 
As of December 31, 2020, we estimated our backlog at approximately $31.5 million over the next three years under existing contract relationships, of which $6.0 million was funded. This backlog consists of outstanding contracts and general commitments from current clients. We regularly provide services to certain clients on an as-needed basis without regard to a specific contract. General commitments represent those services which we anticipate providing to such clients during a twelve-month period.
Competition
 
There are hundreds of firms performing traditional information technology services, business intelligence and cybersecurity, and general consulting for the federal government. A great number of them are much larger than IAI, and are more established in the marketplace, and have more resources to pursue individual prospects.
 
The competition in the conversion and modernization market is very strong. Many software professional services companies have had some involvement in this area and profess proficiency in performing these projects. We also face competition from other companies that purport to substantially automate the process through software tools including Blue Phoenix Solutions, Fujitsu, and IBM. Software for enterprise resource planning, such as SAP and Oracle, provides an additional source of competition, although to date, the cost and lengthy installation time for enterprise resource planning software has slowed its implementation in the market place. No matter what type of solution is offered, many of our competitors have greater name recognition than our company, a larger, more established customer base, and significantly greater financial and market resources.
 
In the realm of enterprise-based web content management systems, there are a number of small and large companies offering such software products and related consulting services. We believe that the Adobe Experience Manager product suite will continue to excel against such competition, including offerings such as Microsoft’s SharePoint solution. AEM has performed well in the federal marketplace due to its full offering of powerful capabilities such as cloud integration and intuitive customization. Adobe Experience Manager is a solution that optimizes the authoring, management and delivery of digital media and content across owned channels, including Web, mobile, email, print and social communities. From 2019 to 2020, Gartner named Adobe as a leader in multiple categories of its Magic Quadrant reporting including, but not limited to, Digital Experience Platforms, Personalization Engines, CRM Lead Management, Ad Tech, Digital Commerce, and Multichannel Marketing Hubs.

Government Regulation
 
We are bound by various rules and regulations promulgated by the federal government and agencies thereunder. We have not experienced undue expense beyond those expenses normally incurred in our ordinary course of business in adhering to such rules and regulations. Since historically most of our business is derived from contracts either directly with the U.S. federal government or as a subcontractor on behalf of U.S. federal government customers, most of our contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government.
Intellectual Property
 
We depend upon a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our methodologies, databases and software. We have not filed any patent applications covering our methodologies and software. In addition, we attempt to protect the secrecy of our proprietary databases and other trade secrets and proprietary information through agreements with employees and consultants.
 
We also seek to protect the source code of our proprietary ICONS legacy code conversion tools suite as trade secrets. The copyright protection accorded to databases, however, is fairly limited. While the arrangement and selection of data can be protected, the actual data is not, and others are free to create software performing the same function. We believe, however, that the creation of competing databases would be very time consuming and costly.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed thirty-three full-time and four part-time individuals. In addition, we maintained subcontractor relationships with companies and individuals that add six individuals for professional information technology services. All of our billable professional employees have at least four years of related experience. For computer related services, we believe that the diverse professional opportunities and interaction among our employees contribute to maintaining a stable professional staff with limited turnover.
 
We have no collective bargaining agreements or other such labor contracts with our employees and believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory. In the long-term, management will likely hire additional staff to meet its anticipated growth requirements. We do not anticipate encountering material problems in our ability to hire individuals with the requisite employee skill sets, despite a competitive market for our requisite technical skill sets and government clearances, when required. We utilize fee-based recruiting firms when it is necessary to speed up the process of locating and hiring employees with specialized skill sets and clearances.
