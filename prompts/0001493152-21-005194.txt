General
 
Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Provectus” or the “Company”), is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapy medicines for different diseases, with the aims of maximizing the curative impact of these medicines and achieving immunity from treated disease. These investigational drugs are based on an entire, wholly-owned, family of small molecules called halogenated xanthenes (“HXs”); our lead HX molecule is named rose bengal disodium (“RBD”). Former scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory founded Provectus in 2002, identifying and advancing RBD’s dark-effect therapeutic potential and developing RBD and HXs into proprietary molecules. Starting in 2017, new science and business leadership pivoted and then expanded drug discovery and development, targeting global patient populations in a number of disease areas and indications made viable by RBD’s immunotherapeutic potential and new routes of administration.
Science
 
RBD possesses an innovative physical chemistry science with broad-spectrum prophylactic and therapeutic medical applications. The prerequisite mechanistic step for these immunotherapies is direct contact between RBD and disease that may lead to disease death repair, RBD treatment-specific innate immune activation, and disease-specific functional adaptive immune response. RBD displays consistent mechanistic behavior across different indications of a disease and across different disease areas, with the potential to be a multi-disease treatment platform and a universal contributor to different medical treatments.
Drug Discovery and Development Strategy
 
New company leadership has a compelling vision of accessible and affordable, safe, broad-spectrum small molecule immunotherapies. Provectus’ legacy intralesional (IL) oncology clinical program was pivoted and enhanced to pursue U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and/or Australia’s Therapeutics Good Administration (“TGA”) regulatory advancement for rare or refractory cancers of the skin and cancers of the liver in both single-agent and combination therapy settings.
 
Drug development was expanded to pursue proof-of-concept of systemic RBD administration. Routes of administration and target diseases being developed include oral (“PO”) hematology in relapsed and refractory adult and pediatric leukemias, and PO oncology for prophylactic and/or therapeutic RBD in high-risk adult solid tumor cancers. Drug discovery into RBD treatment has also been deepened to explore different disease areas. Target diseases include virology, such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19); microbiology, such as antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria; ophthalmology, such as diseases of the cornea; and dermatology, such as combination therapy with systemic biologics for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

RBD and HX Intellectual Property (“IP”)
 
RBD, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in our current investigational immunotherapy medicines, is a systemically-active, environmentally-adaptive stable, and selective small molecule. RBD has a nominal formula of 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2’,4’,5’,7’-tetraiodofluorescein disodium. Rose bengal drug substance (“RB DS”) is produced by Provectus’ Quality-by-Design (“QbD”) manufacturing process, which avoids the formation of uncontrolled impurities generally (and also proprietarily) known to be present in commercial-grade rose bengal, and follows International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”) Guidelines for pharmaceutical ingredients and current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations. Multiple Provectus cGMP RB DS lots have surpassed multi-year stability testing.
 
The Company’s science and molecules are currently protected by global intellectual property that includes composition of matter, manufacturing methods and techniques, pharmaceutical synthesis standards, trade secrets, and concomitant combination therapy use for different disease areas.

PV-10 Product Pipeline
 
PV-10 is an injectable pharmaceutical formulation of RBD and registration study-ready investigational drug product (“PV-10 DP”). Multiple lots of PV-10 DP have surpassed multi-year stability testing, respectively. PV-10 DP is shipped, stored, and used at room temperature. Provectus has developed two clinical-stage formulations of PV-10: an IL administration for oncology (10% RBD) for the treatment of cancers of the skin and cancers of the liver, and topical (“top.”) application for dermatology (0.01% RBD) for the treatment of inflammatory dermatoses (psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and actinic keratosis). A third formulation is under development for a currently proprietary disease area. Research into new routes of RBD administration and formulations of PV-10 is ongoing, including PO, intranasal (“IN”), top., and/or intravenous (“IV”) for hematology, oncology, virology, microbiology, and/or ophthalmology.

Competition
 
In general, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are competitive, characterized by steady and sometimes disruptive advances in products and technology. A number of companies have developed and continue to develop products that address the areas we have targeted. Some of these companies are pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that are international in scope and very large in size, while others are small companies that have been successful in one or more areas we are targeting. Existing or future pharmaceutical, device, or other competitors may develop products that accomplish similar functions to our technologies in ways that may be less expensive, receive faster regulatory approval, or receive greater market acceptance than our products. Many of our competitors have been in existence longer than we have, have greater capital resources, broader internal structure for research, development, manufacturing and marketing, and may be further along in their respective product cycles.

Federal Regulation of Therapeutic Products
 
All of the prescription drug candidates we currently contemplate developing will require approval by the FDA prior to sales within the U.S. and by comparable international governmental healthcare regulatory agencies prior to sale outside the U.S. The FDA and comparable international agencies impose substantial requirements on the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety and effectiveness claims, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of our prescription drug candidates. While we attempt to minimize and avoid significant regulatory bars when formulating our products, some degree of regulation from these regulatory agencies is unavoidable.
 
The regulatory process required by the FDA, through which our prescription drug candidates must successfully pass before they may be marketed in the U.S., generally involves pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing, submission of an application that must become effective before clinical trials may begin, adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication, and FDA approval to market a given product for a given indication after the appropriate application has been filed. For pharmaceutical products, pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. We will require sponsored work to be conducted in compliance with pertinent local and international regulatory requirements, including those providing for Institutional Review Board approval, national governing agency approval, and patient informed consent, using protocols consistent with ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and other internationally recognized standards and delineated by ICH Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) standards.
 
If the FDA is satisfied with the results and data from pre-clinical tests, it will authorize human clinical trials. Human clinical trials traditionally are conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap. Each of the three phases involves testing and study of specific aspects of the effects of the investigational product on human subjects, including testing for safety, dosage tolerance, side effects, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and clinical efficacy.
 
Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans, or via a new route of administration or new organ system if previously investigated in humans. These studies are closely monitored and may be conducted in patients but may also be conducted in healthy volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. While the FDA can cause us to end clinical trials at any phase due to safety concerns, Phase 1 clinical trials are primarily concerned with safety issues. We also attempt to obtain sufficient information about the drug candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects during Phase 1 clinical trials to permit the design of scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies.
 
Phase 1 studies also evaluate drug metabolism, structure-activity relationships, and the mechanism of action in humans. These studies also determine which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. The total number of subjects included in Phase 1 studies varies with the drug but is generally in the range of 10 to 80.
 
Phase 2 clinical trials include early controlled clinical studies conducted to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition. This phase of testing also helps determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are often randomized controlled studies that are closely monitored and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving up to several hundred people.
 
Phase 3 studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained in Phase 2 and are intended to gather definitive information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug. Phase 3 studies also provide an adequate basis for extrapolating the results to the general population and transmitting that information in the physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand people.
 
We have established a core clinical development team and have been working with external and FDA-experienced consultants to assist us in developing product-specific development and approval strategies, preparing the required submittals, guiding us through the regulatory process, and providing input into the design and site selection of human clinical studies.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we may not obtain FDA approval on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. The FDA or research institution conducting the trials may suspend clinical trials or may not permit trials to advance from one phase to another at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw a prescription drug approval if we do not comply with pertinent regulatory requirements and standards or if problems are identified after the product reaches the market. If the FDA grants approval of a prescription drug candidate, the approval may impose limitations, including limits on the indicated uses for which we may market a drug product. In addition, the FDA may require additional testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety and/or effectiveness of approved drug products that have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Further, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug product may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal from the market.
 
Marketing our prescription drug candidates abroad will require similar regulatory approvals by equivalent national authorities and is subject to similar risks. To expedite development, we may pursue some or all of our initial clinical testing and approval activities outside the U.S., and in particular in those countries where our prescription drug candidates may have substantial medical and commercial relevance. In some such cases, any resulting drug products may be brought to the U.S. after substantial offshore experience is gained. Accordingly, we intend to pursue any such development in a manner consistent with U.S. and ICH standards so that the resultant development data is maximally applicable for potential global approval.
