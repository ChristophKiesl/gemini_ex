Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We design, develop, sell, and rent exoskeleton products that augment human strength, endurance and mobility. Our exoskeleton technology serves multiple markets and can be utilized both by able-bodied users and persons with physical disabilities. We have sold or rented devices that (i) enable individuals with neurological conditions affecting gait (acquired brain injury, or ABI, and spinal cord injury, or SCI) to rehabilitate, and in some cases, to walk again, (ii) assist individuals with a broad range of upper extremity impairments, and (iii) allow industrial workers to perform difficult repetitive work for extended periods. 
We believe that the commercial opportunity for exoskeleton technology adoption is accelerating as a result of recent advancements in material technologies, electronic and electrical engineering, control technologies, and sensor and software development. Taken individually, many of these advancements have become ubiquitous in peoples’ everyday lives. Supported by an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio, we believe that we have learned how to integrate these existing technologies; wrapping the result around a human being efficiently, elegantly and safely. We further believe that we can do so across a broad spectrum of applications, from persons with lower limb paralysis to able-bodied users.
For medical applications we have two primary products.
•EksoNR is used as a rehabilitation tool to allow physicians and therapists to rehabilitate patients who have suffered a stroke or spinal cord injury. In June 2020, we received 501(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to market our EksoNR for use with patients with ABI. With its unique features designed specifically for hospitals and its proprietary SmartAssist software, EksoNR allows for the early mobilization of patients and, increased endurance during rehabilitation sessions through higher step counts and extended training durations. The intent is to allow the patient's central nervous system to take advantage of a patient's neuroplasticity to maximize recovery.
•EksoUE is a wearable upper body exoskeleton that assists patients with a broad range of upper extremity impairments and aims to provide a wider active range of motion, increased endurance, and heightened intensity during rehabilitation sessions.
For able-bodied industrial workers, we built on the leading market position we achieved with EksoVest and EksoZeroG by introducing EVO, a new wearable exoskeleton for overhead work. Like EksoVest, EVO is an upper body exoskeleton that elevates and supports a worker's arms to assist them with tasks ranging from chest height to overhead. Based on extensive customer feedback, EVO was designed specifically to increase adoption of exoskeletons in the workplace. Compared to EksoVest, EVO is lighter weight, lower profile, lower cost, and has minimal contact with the body, making it comfortable to wear while enabling an even broader free range of motion. The goal is for workers using EVO to experience lower levels of fatigue and reduce on-site injuries while boosting productivity. In 2020, we introduced EVO into targeted vertical markets including food processing, specific construction trades, and manufacturing.
EksoHealth - Rehabilitation
Today, we focus our healthcare business on rehabilitation robotics. We are leveraging our patented exoskeleton technology to develop and market products intended to enable patients with lower limb impairments to rehabilitate earlier and with better outcomes than the current standard of care.
EksoNR
Our leading product, EksoNR, is a wearable bionic suit that allows our hospital and rehabilitation customers to provide in-patients and out-patients the ability to stand and walk over ground while the device makes real-time adjustments to correct issues with the patient’s reciprocal gait. Patients receive therapy in the device under the supervision of a physical therapist, and typically use an additional assistive device such as a cane, crutches or a walker. Walking is achieved by a user shifting their weight, requiring the user to achieve balance thereby replicating and reinforcing the movements of a natural gait. If needed, some patients utilize sensors in the device which assist in step initiation. Battery-powered motors drive the legs, detecting the deficient neuromuscular function and providing the level of assistance necessary for a user to complete their step. Users can expect to walk, with aid from the device, the first time they put on the EksoNR exoskeleton (after passing an assessment). Physical therapists can transfer patients to or from their wheelchair and don or remove the EksoNR in less than ten minutes.
The EksoNR incorporates SmartAssist, our proprietary, adaptive software that allows a patient to perform to their capability but dynamically provides 0-100% power on either side of the body as needed for successful walking. SmartAssist can promote a greater number of high-quality steps in a short time period and support the early re-learning of correct step patterns and weight shifts, potentially mitigating compensatory behaviors. SmartAssist also has allowed our customers to significantly expand the spectrum of patients that can potentially benefit from robotic rehabilitation.
In addition, SmartAssist can aid in promoting early mobility by training patients (PreGait) to walk in an exoskeleton.We believe this expands access of care to additional patients. SmartAssist also includes next generation Variable Assist technology. Variable Assist allows healthcare providers to adjust the level of assistance provided by the EksoNR as necessary, in some instances allowing patients to power themselves (FreeGait). 
Another important feature of our EksoNR is its EksoPulse Analytics, a real-time data capture program. EksoPulse gathers and transmits statistics and device information during EksoNR walking sessions. This information can be used to track patient progression and to monitor device utilization. The EksoNR records data such as steps, speed, step size, and other settings along with error logs and operating parameters. Data is sent securely to our servers where it is available for customers to view, filter, and export through a secure web portal. This feature enables more thorough patient care while reducing manual data entry. It also enables us to provide a higher level of service through early identification and thorough reporting of device errors, saving customers the time and expense of unnecessary on-site visits.
The EksoNR is used by customers in both in-patient and out-patient settings. Our customers believe that for patients with some preserved motor ability (for example, after a stroke, a traumatic brain injury (TBI), or an incomplete SCI), the EksoNR exoskeleton offers unique benefits. It helps therapists teach proper step patterns and weight shifts, allowing patients potentially to mobilize earlier and ultimately to walk again. By allowing individuals to stand and walk in a full weight-bearing setting, early clinical evidence is  beginning to show, that EksoNR may offer potential healthcare benefits (inclusive of patients with complete SCI). These benefits include a reduction in secondary complications such as pressure sores, urinary tract infections, bowel problems, pneumonia and other respiratory issues, bone loss/osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and psychological disorders resulting in reduced post injury medical costs.
EksoGT
EksoGT, previously our leading rehabilitation product, has been superseded by EksoNR. We may still sell small quantities of EksoGT into certain foreign countries while awaiting regulatory clearance for our EksoNR. For existing customers with one or more previously purchased EksoGT, we offer an upgrade package.
As of December 31, 2020, we had shipped over 500 EksoGT and EksoNR units combined to over 400 rehabilitation facilities or customers worldwide. The number of units utilized at a facility varies from one to six, and is driven by the number of beds and rehabilitation sessions a hospital can offer and that hospital’s adoption of robotics within its rehabilitation protocols.
EksoUE
In 2019, we entered the market for upper extremity rehabilitation devices with EksoUE. EksoUE is a wearable assistive device that helps to reduce the effect of gravity on the wearer’s shoulders and arms. While worn, EksoUE allows longer, more intense rehabilitation sessions by reducing fatigue, while also allowing the patient to achieve a larger active range of motion. Similar to EksoNR, EksoUE is a tool for use by trained clinicians, primarily physical and occupational therapists, during rehabilitation sessions. Based on the same technology that is used in our industrial products, EksoUE uses a passive (non-motorized) design which avoids the need to charge or manage batteries and other electrical systems. 
Market Overview

Rehabilitation clinics with significant stroke, TBI, and SCI populations comprise the primary market for our medical products. Due to their chronic nature, we believe that these conditions have an enormous clinical and economic impact on both people with the conditions and the healthcare system. According to the Centers for Disease Control, there are approximately 800,000 strokes suffered per year in the U.S. and approximately 15 million worldwide, making stroke rehabilitation our largest target market. Likewise, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, there are approximately 18,000 incidences of SCI per year in the U.S., and according to the World Health Organization, between 250,000 to 500,000 incidences worldwide. 
While the market opportunity for robotic exoskeleton rehabilitation may be large, we also recognize that the path for medical devices to become the standard of care is long and challenging. We believe that our ability to accelerate adoption will also be based, in part, on our ability to build on our partners’ early efforts: (i) to expand clinical evidence and (ii) to drive toward 
standard of care. We are already seeing customers appreciate that one way for stroke patients at in-patient facilities to receive the recommended amount of rehabilitation per guidelines is by using an EksoNR, the only device currently in the market that has the versatility to provide an over-ground gait training intervention that is task-specific, high intensity and allows for a margin of error, across the continuum of care.
Clinical Evidence
Many of our early clinical customers have participated in research focusing on safety and feasibility of exoskeletons and robotics in rehabilitation market development. These early studies were favorable and have further developed to focus on efficacy and outcomes. EksoNR technology is one of the most studied exoskeletons in the market. World-renowned institutions are leading the charge in research focused on acquired brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and others. EksoNR is involved in over 115 investigator-initiated studies with greater than 2000 enrolled patient participants. Notable gains have been observed with increased heart rate, rating of perceived exertion and metabolic responses when walking in EksoNR. Also discussed is improved gait speed, walking distance and standing balance out of EksoNR demonstrating improvements in motor activity and functional mobility independence. Our latest company sponsored WISE (Walking Improvement for SCI with Exoskeleton) study demonstrates clinically meaningful improvement in independent walking speed, functional gains in shorter timeframe and influence of factors that may modify gait recovery. The data is currently being submitted to journals for publication. 
The European Union also requires a two-track approach to market penetration and subsequent coverage, requiring separate claims for purchasing the device and for requests for reimbursement. We are well represented in clinics run by German and Austrian accident insurers, with four out of nine rehabilitation sites in Germany and four out of four rehabilitation sites in Austria. We operate out-patient rehabilitation sessions paid by an accident insurer, where a patient trains using our EksoGT or EksoNR device twice a week. We are using these examples to integrate exoskeletal therapy in existing care pathways. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, has selected us as the first exoskeleton company to produce a Medtech Innovation Briefing, or MIB, which are designed to support National Health Services, or NHS, and social care commissioners and staff who are considering using new medical devices and other medical or diagnostic technologies. The MIB highlighted the innovative aspect of our proprietary SmartAssist software, which differentiates our EksoNR and EksoGT from other available exoskeletons.
Economic Value Proposition
We believe that our EksoNR allows our customers to benefit economically without modifying the reimbursement model or reimbursement codes. First, many of our customers have reported that utilizing the EksoNR promotes continuous patient improvement beginning sooner than with traditional rehabilitation methods, potentially leading to a commensurate increase in insurance reimbursements. Second, many of our customers report that facilities equipped with EksoNR as part of their rehabilitation programs attract more patients, thereby driving positive economic benefits. Lastly, we believe that improvements in patient outcomes, such as those seen with the use of EksoNR, translate positively to other metrics including discharge to community, staffing efficiency in the rehabilitation unit, and reductions in readmission rates.
Current Sales and Marketing Efforts
Our key marketing goal today is the broad-based commercial adoption of our EksoNR in the rehabilitation setting. We are focusing our go-to-market protocols and collateral on our three target audiences: medical administrators, medical directors/ therapists, and patients. Working closely with thought leaders, we will continue to build upon our early user-group exchanges, develop clinical education programs, and grow our medical advisory council.
There continues to be high market interest in expanding neurosciences service lines. In alignment with this interest, our sales priority involves the education of clinical and executive stakeholders on the economic and clinical value of our EksoNR Robotics Neuro Rehabilitation Program under our FDA indications of Stroke, Acquired Brain Injury, and Spinal Cord Injury. In tandem, we continue to leverage our EksoNR customer base to educate and mentor strategic target centers that specialize in Stroke, ABI and SCI rehabilitation in key market service areas across the US and Canada. Geographically, the priorities have been Canada, the U.S., and Mexico in the Americas, Germany in EMEA (the Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region), and Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia in APAC (the Asia Pacific region). Currently, we utilize a direct sales force for the U.S., Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany and Switzerland. We also have an expanding distributor network in EMEA and Asia.
The sales and marketing team is principally based in the U.S., Germany, and Singapore, and is structured as follows:
•One commercial leader each for the Americas, EMEA, and APAC;
•Americas, EMEA, and APAC sales professionals that pursue new prospects and organize demonstrations;
•Clinical professionals and physical therapists that provide peer-to-peer demonstrations and trainings;
•Marketing professionals and consultants to build awareness and generate demand;
•Ambassadors, who are stroke and SCI survivors, that provide demonstrations and personal experiences.
The sales cycle for the EksoNR averages approximately eight to 12 months for a first device and six to eight months for subsequent devices. Our typical sale is our EksoNR complete package, which includes the device and all relevant components, two sets of batteries for continuous run-time, training through two levels of certification, and SmartAssist software. Customers also typically purchase Ekso Care, which is our one- to four-year after-sales service package.
Clinical Services and Customer Success
We have developed leading clinical capability in robotic rehabilitation, and we provide extensive training and support to our customers to ensure they are successful. All rentals or sales include customer training. This is comprised of both on-line and in-person training of our customers’ physical therapists. We have made this a high priority as we recognize getting customers comfortable using our product is a prerequisite to them successfully implementing a robotic rehabilitation program. In addition to the training that is included with each sale or rental, we also offer additional training services for customers who are interested in more advanced uses of the product or who desire more supervised experiences.
After Sales Service
We provide direct service for the EksoNR at our facilities in Richmond, California, and Germany. In addition, we utilize third-party service providers for some customers in EMEA and APAC. When maintenance or service is required, a customer schedules service by contacting us directly. We then arrange for the appropriate service, depending on the level of Ekso Care the customer has purchased and the nature of the service required. In some cases, we may decide it is appropriate to send an Ekso field technician onsite to service the device. However, many service issues are diagnosable remotely with the use of EksoPulse.
In addition to the Ekso Care service programs we provide a Fee-for-Service option. In this program, EksoNR repair is fulfilled per quote on demand of the customer and as per our repair price list.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain 
We produce the EksoNR at our facilities in Richmond, California for worldwide sales. We currently run one line for one shift per day and believe we have the capacity to eventually run additional lines and shifts should we deem it appropriate. The EksoNR uses over 700 purchased parts, which we source globally from over 70 suppliers. Whenever possible, we seek to secure dual source suppliers for our components.
Our commitment to the philosophy of continuous improvement has continued to increase product performance and reliability over the past year. As a result, we expect our cost of field service will continue to decline over the next 12 months.
EksoWorks - Able-Bodied Industrial Applications
We continue to pursue market and product development opportunities for the industrial market. Our initial efforts have included EksoZeroG Arm, a mobile arm mount that makes heavy tools feel weightless and enables workers to be more productive and safe, and EksoVest, an upper body exoskeleton that elevates and supports a worker's arms to assist them with tasks ranging from chest height to overhead. 
Building on our existing EksoVest technology, in August of 2020 we introduced EVO, an endurance-boosting assistive upper body exoskeleton that alleviates the burden of repetitive work. EVO’s innovative design is our latest product for able-bodied applications. EVO is a passive, spring-loaded assistive upper-body exoskeleton that aids workers with overhead work. It is designed to reduce fatigue and shoulder and back muscle strain, with the goal of eliminating work-related injuries to the neck, shoulder, and back. EVO offers 5-15 pounds of lift assistance in each arm to elevate and alleviate the day-to-day strain on workers across all industries. Shoulder injuries caused by overhead work, repetitive tasks, and overexertion is the leading cause of lost work days due to workplace injuries. Ekso Bionics is striving to alleviate the burden on skilled workers, drastically reducing the number of workplace injuries and cutting down on worker fatigue.
Market feedback continues to indicate a growing imperative among construction and manufacturing companies to drive adoption of improved safety and health practices. Furthermore, based on initial field-testing and market research, we believe that industrial exoskeletons have the potential to help prevent workforce injuries, improve productivity and over time reduce 
workers’ compensation and related costs. In the U.S. alone, our target manufacturing and construction verticals employ a total of 18.4 million workers (according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), many of whom can potentially benefit from our assistive technology.
In addition, human augmentation technology is being viewed by senior managers of companies that have participated in field-testing as an opportunity to extend the careers of experienced and skilled workers while also changing the work environment to attract future workers to these careers.
While we believe that the evidence clearly demonstrates that there is significant demand for human augmentation in industrial applications, adoption rates remain a challenge due to the nascent nature of the technology. That said, we believe that there is significant mid-to-long-term potential in the industrial markets, and accordingly, we will continue our product development efforts to expand our EksoWorks product offerings. Given the fragmented nature of the industrial market we believe that the best approach in this market involves collaboration with established strategic partners that can help us target applications tailored for specific use cases. We believe that leveraging our extensive exoskeleton expertise and intellectual property portfolio with the established channel and applying the expertise of one or more strategic partners unlocks the highest value for us and our stockholders. We continue to engage with multiple potential industrial partners, and plan to continue this approach going forward.
China Joint Venture
We entered into a joint venture, or the China JV, to develop and serve the exoskeleton market in China and certain other Asian markets and to create a global exoskeleton manufacturing center. The Equity Joint Venture Contract, dated January 30, 2019, between us, Zhejiang Youchuang Venture Capital Investment Co., Ltd., and another partner, collectively referred to as, the JV Partners, as amended by the Amendment to the Joint Venture Contract, dated April 30, 2019, or the JV Agreement, provided for the establishment of the China JV as a limited liability company pursuant to the Law on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures and the Regulations for the Implementation of the Law on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures. In May 2020, the Company, and the JV Partners received notice from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, in connection with its review of the Company’s and the JV Partners’ investment in the China JV. The notice stated that CFIUS’s prior national security concerns regarding the China JV could not be mitigated. In connection with such determination, on July 13, 2020, the Company and the JV Partners entered into a National Security Agreement, or NSA, which, among other things, required the termination of the Company’s agreements and role with the China JV. On August 12, 2020, the Company and the JV Partners agreed to terminate the agreements underlying the China JV. As of December 31, 2020, all agreements related to the China JV had been terminated.
Intellectual Property
We have established an extensive intellectual property portfolio that includes various U.S. patents and patent applications. The table below provides a summary of U.S. patents by issuing status and ownership status.

 | Issuing Status
License Status | IssuedPatents | PendingApplications
Licensed to the Company | 15 | | —
Exclusively licensed to the Company | 6 | | —
Co-owned with Regents of the University of California, exclusively licensed to the Company | 4 | | —
Co-owned with the Regents of the University of California | 3 | | —
Sole ownership by the Company | 33 | | 4
Total: 65 | 61 | | 4

Pending applications mean a complete application has been filed with the applicable patent authority and additional action is pending. 
Many of these applications have also been filed internationally as appropriate for their respective subject matter. As of December 31, 2020, 203 applications have issued or have been allowed as patents internationally. Our patent portfolio contains 227 cases that have issued or are in prosecution in 21 countries outside the U.S.
Our patent portfolio includes product and method type claims, since the devices that we produce and the processes performed by those devices are patentable. Our patents encompass technologies relevant to our devices, including medical exoskeletons, commercial exoskeletons, actuators, and strength-enhancing exoskeletons. The earliest priority date of the portfolio reaches back to 2003, and new applications may continue to be filed from time-to-time.
Licensors include the Regents of the University of California, or UC Berkeley, and Garrett Brown (as a result of our acquisition of technology of Equipois, LLC, or Equipois).
The license with UC Berkeley consists of two agreements and one amendment to the agreement covering ten patent cases exclusively licensed to us, nine of which have issued and one of which remains in prosecution or the UC Berkeley License Agreements. Inventions covered by a further three patent applications are co-owned by us and UC Berkeley, with no license agreement between us and UC Berkeley. As a result, UC Berkeley may license its rights in these patents to a third party. With respect to two of these co-owned patent applications, UC Berkeley has licensed their rights in the U.S. to an unrelated third party. The third patent application will need to be fully prosecuted before it can be determined which claims are exclusive to us (through a previous license) and which claims UC Berkeley may license to other entities.
Pursuant to the UC Berkeley License Agreements, Ekso Bionics initially paid UC Berkeley consideration consisting of $5,000 in cash and 310,400 common shares of Ekso Bionics, and committed to pay a 1% royalty on sales, including sales generated by sublicenses. In addition, the UC Berkeley License Agreements call for minimum annual payments of $50,000. We do not pay royalties to UC Berkeley on products sold or to be resold to the U.S. government.
In some cases, as a result of government funding we receive, the patents have a government use license, granting the U.S. government a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license for use of the inventions for or on behalf of the U.S. government, as is typical in the case of government sponsored research.
In connection with our acquisition of assets of Equipois, we assumed the rights and obligations of Equipois under a license agreement with Garrett Brown, the developer of certain intellectual property related to mechanical balance and support arm technologies, which grants us an exclusive license with respect to the technology and patent rights for certain fields of use. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we will be required to pay Mr. Brown a single-digit royalty on net receipts, subject to a $50,000 annual minimum royalty requirement.
Intellectual Property Out-Licensing
We believe that the breadth of the coverage across various bionic systems and technologies, together with our freedom to grant sub-licenses under the UC Berkeley License Agreements gives us the potential to generate licensing revenue in fields outside our present areas of commercialization. Since 2009, we have generated approximately $1.8 million in such licensing revenue from our two licensees: Lockheed Martin Corporation or Lockheed and OttoBock Healthcare Product GmbH or OttoBock.
We receive revenue pursuant to a Government Field Cross License Agreement dated as of July 1, 2013 between Ekso Bionics, Inc. and Lockheed and a Cross License Agreement dated as of July 1, 2013 between Ekso Bionics, Inc. and Lockheed. Pursuant to these agreements, we have licensed to Lockheed certain rights with respect to our anthropomorphic exoskeleton technology for which Lockheed is obligated to pay us a royalty on sales of products incorporating such technology. Royalty fees from Lockheed were either de minimus or nil for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
With respect to OttoBock, we received exclusivity payments pursuant to the License and Services Agreement dated October 27, 2014. The License and Services Agreement grants OttoBock exclusive rights in order to develop a semi-active prosthetic knee prototype for use in medical prosthetics and provides that OttoBock will pay us a royalty based on sales by OttoBock of products incorporating the licensed technology. We did not receive any royalty fees from Ottobock during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In November of 2019, OttoBock informed us that they will not be pursuing commercialization of products based on our intellectual property. As a result, we do not expect additional royalty revenue from OttoBock in the future.
In March 2018, we entered into a set of agreements with Daydo Co, Ltd., or Daydo, related to distribution and cross-licensing of EksoVest. Under these agreements, Daydo has exclusive distribution rights for EksoVest within Japan and rights to modify EksoVest as needed to address the Japanese market in exchange for royalty payments to us. We also have rights to use any improvements made by Daydo. Daydo released its localized version of EksoVest (called Task AR) in January of 2019. Revenue from related royalty payments was de minimis in 2020 and 2019. 
In June 2020, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with HAWE Hydraulik of Germany for rights to develop hydraulic pumps covered by a family of our patents. The agreement additionally includes an exclusivity option. We did not receive any royalty revenue from this license in 2020.
Competition
The medical technology and industrial robotics industries are characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change. We believe that a number of other companies are developing competitive technology and devices for both the able-bodied and medical fields of use and many of these competitors have significantly more financial and other resources than we possess.
In the medical field, we face competition from companies that are focused on technology for rehabilitation of patients suffering from stroke and related neurological disabilities as well as from companies that are focused on SCI. In stroke, Cyberdyne, Parker Hannafin’s Indego, and ReWalk all now offer ambulatory exoskeletons for rehabilitation use in various markets where we operate. While not functionally equivalent, Hocoma, AlterG, Aretech and Reha Technology are selling treadmill-based gait therapies. In SCI, ReWalk Robotics and Parker Hannafin also sell ambulatory exoskeletons. Other companies who have announced plans to commercialize robotic exoskeletons include: Bionik Laboratories and SuitX.
Technologies developed by competitors in the areas of stroke rehabilitation and SCI represent therapeutic interventions with utility at varying points of the continuum of care. Clinically, the EksoNR is unique in its broad ability to mobilize pre- or even non-ambulatory patients using a full weight bearing, over ground, task-based platform. From a practice management perspective, the EksoNR is less expensive than many other systems, has a smaller footprint, the ability to move around the hospital, and uses standard power requirements that make it easy to integrate into existing infrastructure. Other over-ground exoskeletons were initially designed for an individual to achieve ambulation reliant on the device. By contrast, the EksoNR’s design accommodates patients with complete paraplegia and additionally includes features that are optimized to assist therapists in helping patients with some motor ability learn to walk again in a clinical setting, treating several patients and indications in a single day.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the most pressing challenges we face are not necessarily competitive technologies, but rather achieving rapid market awareness and adoption of this emerging technology while acclimating prospects to a fundamentally new paradigm in neuro-rehabilitation and mobility. In addition, it may be difficult for the rehabilitation department of a hospital or clinic to secure the funds for acquisition of an Ekso device in an environment where capital expenditures of this magnitude are not commonly incurred by those rehabilitation departments.
In the able-bodied field, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, BAE Systems, Panasonic, Honda, Daewoo, Noonee, Revision Military, SuitX, Skel-ex, Levitate and Cyberdyne - among others - are each developing or commercializing some form of exoskeleton for military and/or industrial applications.
The field of robotic exoskeleton technology remains in its infancy. As this field develops, we believe that we will face increased competition on the basis of product features, clinical outcomes, price, services and other factors. Our competitive position will depend on multiple, complex factors, including our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products, develop new products, implement production and marketing plans, secure regulatory approvals for products under development and protect our intellectual property. In some instances, competitors may also offer, or may attempt to develop, alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device.
Governmental Regulation and Product Approval
U.S. Regulation
The U.S. government regulates the medical device industry through various agencies, including but not limited to the FDA, which administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. The design, testing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, distribution, advertising, and marketing of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries. Any medical device product that we develop must receive all requisite regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country. 
Device Development, Marketing Clearance and Approval. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose 
lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation, or QSR. Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life- sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, and devices not “substantially equivalent” to a device that is already legally marketed. Most Class I devices, and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from the FDA. Class I and Class II devices that have not been so exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require premarket approval, or PMA, prior to commercial marketing.
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification application to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, which is typically a Class II device that is legally marketed in the United States. A device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device if it has the same intended use and (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) has different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device PMA. While the determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer, the FDA may review this determination and evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may request the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
The second, more comprehensive, approval process applies to a new device that is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device or that is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices requiring PMA. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process, approximately one to two years or more.
In some instances, the FDA may find that a device is new and not substantially equivalent to a predicate device but is also not a high-risk device as is generally the case with Class III PMA devices. In these instances, the FDA may allow a device to be reclassified from Class III to Class I or II. The de novo reclassification option is an alternate pathway to classify novel devices of low to moderate risk that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a “not substantially equivalent” (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) notification. The FDCA also allows a sponsor to submit a de novo reclassification request to the FDA for novel low to moderate risk devices without first being required to submit a 510(k) application. These types of applications are referred to as “Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation” or “de novo.” In instances where a device is deemed not substantially equivalent to a Class II predicate device, the candidate device may be filed as a de novo application which may lead to delays in regulatory decisions by the FDA. FDA review of a de novo application may lead the FDA to identify the device as either a Class I or II device and subject to or exempt from 510(k) premarket notification.
Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA or de novo reclassification application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Clinical trials generally require an investigational device exemption application, or IDE, approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board or an IRB, for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. Conducting a clinical trial also requires obtaining the patients' informed consent in form and substance compliant with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. The FDA or the IRB could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the U.S. To date, the EksoGT has been the subject of several clinical studies, some sponsored by us, as well as non-Ekso-sponsored independent studies conducted by rehabilitation institutions. In addition, we are currently conducting several studies to investigate additional indications for use for the EksoGT, as well as to evaluate clinical and non-clinical outcomes of using the device.
Our current indication for use, or IFU, clearance for stroke, SCI, and ABI. On April 4, 2016, we received clearance from the 
FDA to market our EksoGT robotic exoskeleton for use in the treatment of individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke, individuals with SCI at levels T4 to L5, and individuals with SCI at levels of T3 to C7 (ASIA D), in accordance with the device’s labeling. On July 19, 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to expand/clarify the indications and labeling to expressly include individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke who have upper extremity function of at least 4 out of 5 strength in at least one arm.  On June 15, 2020, we received clearance from FDA to expand the indications for use, or IFU, and labeling to expressly include individuals with acquired brain injury, including traumatic brain injury and stroke who have upper extremity function of at least 4 out of 5 strength in at least one arm.
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:

• | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action; 
• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication; 
• | 510(k) clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; 
• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; 
• | the FDA's recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
• | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and 
• | notices provision regarding corrections or removals. 

Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If the FDA determines that promotional or training material related to an approved device constitute the promotion of an un-cleared or unapproved use, the FDA could request that the promotional or training materials related to such device be modified or it could subject the manufacturer to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired.
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations.
Since January 2020, there has been one report of an adverse event relating to our EksoNR and none related to our EksoGT devices reported to the FDA under the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. Regardless of the FDA’s approval requirements for a particular product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We 
cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
Human Capital Resources and Management
As of February 19, 2021, we had 40 employees, including 39 full time employees and one part-time employee. Seven employees reside in Europe and two in Singapore. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
We endeavor to maintain a workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. We conduct annual training to prevent harassment and discrimination and monitor employee conduct year-round, including by providing employees with access to an anonymous whistleblower hotline to report any violations. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement at the Company is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. Our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and routinely recognized for outstanding performance and provided with training and professional development opportunities. Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talent. We continually assess and strive to enhance employee satisfaction and engagement. Our employees, many of whom have been employed by us for the majority of our existence, frequently express satisfaction with management including by responding positively about our management in anonymous surveys. 
Corporate Information
We were incorporated as PN Med Group Inc. in Nevada on January 30, 2012. Prior to the Merger and Split-Off (each as defined below), our business was to distribute medical supplies and equipment in Chile.
On January 15, 2014, we consummated the Merger, in which our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ekso Acquisition Corp., a corporation formed in the State of Delaware on January 3, 2014, merged with and into Ekso Bionics, Inc., a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 19, 2005. Ekso Bionics was the surviving corporation in the Merger and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of the outstanding Ekso Bionics' capital stock was converted into shares of our common stock in the Merger.
In connection with the Merger and pursuant to a split-off agreement and general release, we transferred our pre-Merger assets and liabilities to our pre-Merger majority stockholders, in exchange for the surrender by them and cancellation of 2,497,586 shares of our common stock, or the Split-Off, after adjusting to give effect to the 1-for-7 reverse stock split, which occurred on May 4, 2016 and the subsequent 1-for-15 reverse stock split, which occurred on March 24, 2020.
As a result of the Merger and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-Merger business and acquired the business of Ekso Bionics, and have continued the existing business operations of Ekso Bionics as a publicly-traded company under the name Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc.
