ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Willdan Group, Inc. (“Willdan”) is a provider of professional, technical and consulting services to utilities, private industry, and public agencies at all levels of government. As resources and infrastructures undergo continuous change, we help organizations and their communities evolve and thrive by providing a wide range of technical services for energy solutions and government infrastructure. Through engineering, program management, policy advisory, and software and data management, we design and deliver trusted, comprehensive, innovative, and proven solutions to improve efficiency, resiliency, and sustainability in energy and infrastructure to our clients. 
The original company was founded in 1964, and Willdan, a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2006 to serve as our holding company. We have a rich heritage of partnering with public agencies in communities with populations ranging from 10,000 to 300,000 people, as we believe that communities of this size are underserved by large outsourcing companies who tend to focus on securing large federal, state, and private sector projects. We commenced providing energy efficiency services in 2008 and, as a result, our client base has grown to include investor-owned and other public utilities, as well as substantial energy users in government and business. 
Our overall growth strategy revolves around a combination of strong organic expansion and strategic acquisitions which provides us the ability to expand the breadth and depth of the services we provide to new and existing clients. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing expansion and transformation of the energy and infrastructure environments. 
We operate our business through a nationwide network of offices spread across 25 states and the District of Columbia. We serve 18 of the 25 largest electric utilities and 5 of the 10 largest municipal utilities in the United States (“U.S.”). Our business with public and private utilities has concentrations in California and New York, but includes numerous other utilities in the Midwest, Southeast and Mountain states and additional acquisitions may continue to expand our geographic footprint. Our business with public agencies is concentrated in California, New York, and Arizona. We also serve special districts, school districts, a large range of public agencies and private industry.
Our broad portfolio of services operates within two financial reporting segments: (1) Energy and (2) Engineering and Consulting. The interfaces and synergies between these segments are important elements of our strategy to design and deliver trusted, comprehensive, innovative, and proven solutions for our customers.
Our Markets
We operate in the energy efficiency services market and the engineering and consulting market. We provide a wide variety of services related to energy efficiency and sustainability, engineering, construction management, economic and financial consulting, and national preparedness and interoperability services primarily to public agencies, utilities, and commercial/industrial firms.
We believe the energy efficiency services market will continue to expand in response to the increasing awareness of global warming, climate change issues, and the advent of new technologies in renewable energy generation and the electrification of the nation’s economy. Private industry and public agencies increasingly seek out cost-effective, turnkey solutions that provide innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation and sustainability services. State and local governments frequently turn to specialized resource conservation firms to strike the balance between environmental responsibility and economic competitiveness. The use of energy efficiency services, including audits, program design, benchmark analysis, metering and incentivized sale and installation of selected energy efficiency measures provides public agencies, utilities, and commercial/industrial firms with the ability to realize long-term savings.
The engineering and consulting market has grown as public agencies and utilities, as well as private utilities and firms, find it more efficient to outsource design, construction oversight, advisory, and training services to service providers, rather than maintain the necessary staff and resources to provide such services themselves. For example, we

design and provide construction oversight of infrastructure projects for state and local governments who have increased their infrastructure-related spending as a result of population growth, increases in local and state funding and aging infrastructure. We provide consulting services to public agencies as they raise the necessary funds to develop such infrastructure projects and provide other services. Relatedly, we provide local government staffing, traffic and transportation engineering, studies, plan reviews, grant support, and inspections. We also advise public agencies on disaster and emergency preparedness.
We believe we are a market and customer driven company, focused on growth and value creation for our clients, employees and shareholders. We seek to establish close working relationships with our clients and expand the breadth and depth of the services we provide to them over time. We believe the market for these services is, and will be, driven by a number of factors, including:

● | Demand for services and solutions that provide energy efficiency, sustainability, water conservation, infrastructure development and renewable energy in the public and private sectors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Changes in technology that affect the generation, distribution and consumption of energy;

For example, our transportation engineering services cover a full spectrum of support functions, including right of way, utility relocation, landscape, survey and mapping, geographic information systems, public outreach, and interagency coordination. Our traffic engineering services include serving as the contract city traffic engineer in communities, as well as performing design and traffic planning projects for our clients.
Water Resources. We assist clients in addressing the many facets of water development, treatment, distribution and conservation, including energy savings, technical, financial, legal, political, and regulatory requirements. Our core competencies include hydraulic modeling, master planning, rate studies and design and construction services. Our design experience includes reservoirs, pressure reducing stations, pump and lift stations, and pipeline alignment studies, as well as water/wastewater collection, distribution, and treatment facilities. We also provide a complete analysis and projection of storm flows for use in drainage master plans and for individual storm drain systems to reduce flooding in streets and adjacent properties. We design open and closed storm drain systems and detention basin facilities, for cities, counties and the Army Corp of Engineers.
District Administration. We administer special districts on behalf of public agencies. The types of special districts administered include community facilities districts (in California, Mello-Roos districts), assessment districts, landscape and lighting districts, school facilities improvement districts, benefit assessment districts, fire suppression districts, and business improvement districts. Our district administration services include calculating the annual levy for each parcel in the district; billing charges directly or through a county tax roll; preparing the annual Engineer’s Report, budget and resolutions; reporting on collections and payment status; calculating prepayment quotes; and providing financial analyses, modeling and budget forecasting.
The key to our district administration services is our proprietary software package, MuniMagic+SM: Municipal Administration & Government Information Coordinator, which we developed internally to redefine the way we administer special districts. MuniMagic+SM is a database management program that maintains parcel data; calculates special taxes, assessments, fees and charges; manages payment tracking; maintains bond-related information in a single, central location; and provides reporting, financial modeling and analysis at multiple levels of detail. MuniMagic+SM offers a significant competitive advantage in an industry driven by the ability to accurately process large quantities of data.

We are organized to profitably manage numerous small and large contracts at the same time. The majority of our contracts typically range from $1,000 to $10,000,000 in contract revenue; however, some of our multi-year contracts have the capacity to provide up to, and in excess, of $380,000,000 in revenue for the implementation of certain energy efficiency programs. Our contracts typically have a duration of between two and thirty-six months, although we have city services contracts that have been in effect for over 30 years. Most of our contracts include a provision allowing for termination for convenience after reimbursement of any unbilled effort under the contract. As of January 1, 2021, we had approximately 2,000 open projects. 
During fiscal year 2020, we had an individual customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated contract revenues. For fiscal year 2020, the LADWP accounted for 10.2% of our consolidated contract revenue. For fiscal year 2020, our top 10 customers accounted for 48.0% of our consolidated contract revenues.
Our largest clients are based in New York and California. In fiscal year 2020, services provided to clients in California accounted for 37.0% of our consolidated contract revenue and services provided to clients in New York accounted for 19.2% of our consolidated contract revenue. 
In 2013, Lime Energy collaborated with Duke Energy - Progress to launch the first ever small business direct install program in North Carolina and South Carolina. Since its launch, the program has grown to encompass all eligible Duke Energy customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. The Small Business Energy Saver Program offers eligible commercial customers the opportunity to retrofit a comprehensive list of existing inefficient equipment with more energy-efficient measures. The program provides integrated turn-key services including program marketing, energy assessments, installation by local contractors, up to 80 percent incentives to offset the cost of projects, and education to encourage the replacement of existing equipment with improvements in lighting, refrigeration, and HVAC. We continue to implement programs across these five states and have completed over 22,000 projects for Duke Energy resulting in over 696,000 MWh in savings to small businesses.

We collaborate with the LADWP through the Commercial Direct Install Program, which is a small business lighting energy efficiency program that serves all commercial customers in LADWP territory with demand up to 250kW. On average, this program typically implements approximately 8,000 energy efficiency projects a year and has implemented almost 80,000 projects since program inception in 2008. Over that time, we have saved LADWP and its customers over 480,000 MWh per year and 96 MW of peak demand and also provided lead generation identifying roughly 9,000 HVAC tune-ups, 6,000 programmable thermostats installations, and 5,000 hot water efficiency upgrades.
In January 2017, we announced a new three-year contract with Consolidated Edison to implement Consolidated Edison’s Small and Medium Business Direct Install (“SMB”) program across the utility's New York City and Westchester County service area. This program replaced and expanded Consolidated Edison's Small Business Direct Install (“DCI”) program, which we had implemented since 2009. It continues the process of diversifying the program offerings. The Consolidated Edison contract continues through the end of 2022. The SMB program, Consolidated Edison's largest energy efficiency program, helps customers save energy, lower their bills and protect the environment by providing financial incentives to identify and buy down the cost of energy efficiency measures. To support this effort, we provide full-service program implementation including outreach and direct sales to potential commercial customers, on-site energy efficiency assessments, direct implementation of energy savings measures and subcontractor management. The administration of incentive payments to other contractors providing services through the program is included in Willdan’s scope, but the structure of the contract is such that these payments are not included in revenue or expenses. Consolidated Edison may terminate the contract at any time for any reason.
​
In connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Genesys in March 2016, we entered into an administrative services agreement with Genesys pursuant to which our subsidiary, WES, provides Genesys with ongoing administrative, operational and other non-professional support services. Under such administrative services agreement, WES provides administrative services for a series of Genesys’s DASNY contracts. WES provides administrative services to Genesys in its performance of rehabilitation and construction work and architectural and engineering services at various sites within New York State. Services for DASNY under these contracts also include energy efficient design, utility cost evaluation and review, and various regulatory compliance services. Specific project descriptions are set out by DASNY in work authorizations, which are issued under the terms of the contracts. The 

10




termination dates of the DASNY contracts vary; the latest of which is April 2024. Work authorized but not yet completed under this contract continues to be bound by the terms of the agreement beyond the termination date until completion of the projects. Genesys expects to receive an amendment from DASNY to the master contract extending the termination date under DASNY’s option to extend this contract term twice, one year at a time. DASNY may at any time terminate any of the contracts or suspend all projects, for its convenience and without cause.
​
Contract Structure
We generally provide our services under contracts, purchase orders, or retainer letters. The agreements we enter into with our clients typically incorporate one of three principal types of pricing provisions:

● | Time-and-materials provisions provide for reimbursement of costs and overhead plus a fee for labor based on the time expended on a project multiplied by a negotiated hourly billing rate. The profitability achievable on a time-and-materials basis is driven by billable headcount and cost control.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unit-based provisions require the delivery of specific units of work, such as energy efficiency savings goals measured in kWh or Therms, arbitrage rebate calculations, dissemination of municipal securities continuing disclosure reports, or building plan checks, at an agreed price per unit, with the total payment under the contract determined by the actual number of units performed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fixed price provisions require all work under a contract to be performed for a specified lump sum, which may be subject to adjustment if the scope of the project changes. Contracts with fixed price provisions carry certain inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs, delays in project completion, problems with new technologies, price increases for materials, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Consequently, the profitability, if any, of fixed price contracts can vary substantially. Willdan typically hedges some of these risks through the use of fixed price subcontracts for services, material, and equipment.

In relation to the pricing provisions, our service-related contracts, including operations and maintenance services and a variety of technical assistance services, are accounted for over the period of performance, in proportion to the cost of performance. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed and determinable and consider customer contract terms.
For time-and-materials and fixed price contracts, we bill our clients periodically in accordance with the contract terms, based on costs incurred on either an hourly fee basis or on a percentage of completion basis or upon the achievement of certain prescribed milestones, as the project progresses. For unit-based contracts, we bill our clients upon delivery and completion of the contracted item or service, and in some cases, in advance of delivery.
Our contracts come up for renewal periodically and, at the time of renewal, may be subject to renegotiation or recompetition, which could impact the profitability on that contract. In addition, during the term of a contract, public agencies may request additional or revised services which may impact the economics of the transaction. Most of our contracts permit our clients, with prior notice, to terminate the contracts at any time without cause. While we have a large volume of transactions and generally low customer concentration, the renewal, termination, or modification of a contract may have a material effect on our consolidated operations.

Competition
The markets for energy efficiency and sustainability, engineering, construction management, economic and financial consulting, design planning and national preparedness services are competitive and highly fragmented. Our competition varies by type of client, type of service and geography. The range of competitors for any one project can vary depending upon technical specialties, the relative value of the project, geographic location, financial terms, risks associated with the work, and any client-imposed restrictions. We often compete with many other firms ranging from small local firms to large national firms. Contract awards are based primarily on qualifications, relevant experience, staffing capabilities, geographic presence, financial stability and price. We face strong competition primarily from other regional, national, and international providers of energy efficiency and sustainability consulting services, local electrical and mechanical contractors and engineering firms, lighting and lighting fixture manufacturers and lighting fixture distributors. In addition to our existing competitors, new competitors such as large national or international engineering and/or construction companies could enter our markets. 
Doing business with utilities and governmental agencies is complex and requires the ability to understand and comply with intricate regulations and to satisfy periodic audits. We have been serving cities, counties, special districts and other public agencies for over half a century. We believe that the ability to understand these requirements and to successfully conduct business with utilities, governmental entities and agencies is a barrier to entry for potential competitors.
Unlike some of our competitors, we focus our services on utilities and public sector clients. Utility and public sector clients generally choose among competing firms by weighing the quality, experience, innovation and timeliness of the firm’s services. When selecting consultants for engineering projects, many utilities and government agencies are required to, and others choose to, employ Qualifications Based Selection (“QBS”). QBS requires the selection of the most technically qualified firms for a project, while the financial and legal terms of the engagement are generally secondary. 
Our competition varies geographically. Although we provide services in several states, we may be stronger in certain service lines in some geographical areas than in other regions. Similarly, some of our larger competitors are stronger in some service lines in certain localities but are not as competitive in others. Our smaller competitors generally are limited both geographically as well as by the depth and breadth of services they are able to provide.
We believe that no single competitor has sufficient market share to influence the markets in which we operate in.
Insurance
To address the hazards inherent in our business, we maintain insurance coverage through the following policies: commercial general liability, automobile liability, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability, cyber liability, professional liability and umbrella/excess liability. However, if any claims, settlements, or judgements, individually or in the aggregate, exceed our policy limits, we are liable to pay these claims from our assets. We believe our coverage limits reasonably protect us from any material adverse impact that may arise from these insured risks.

Government Regulation, Licensing, and Enforcement
A significant portion of our revenues is derived from services provided to public utilities which are generally overseen by state or local public utility commissions who provide and administer a regulatory framework governing the sourcing, distribution, pricing and general management of electricity and natural gas. Our services are often mandated by these regulatory frameworks requiring utilities to meet certain goals for energy efficiency, renewable energy and other metrics which impact demand for our services. This framework of regulatory mandates is updated by state and local ordinance and some federal regulatory action as well. Demand for our services can be impacted from year to year by changes in these regulatory acts regarding energy management, utility budgets and the allowable financial parameters imposed by these regulatory agencies.
Human Capital Resources
The foundation of our continuing success as a professional services enterprise is the ability to attract and retain qualified talent by providing a culture of equity, diversity, inclusion, development, opportunity and empowerment. This understanding informs our approach to managing our human capital resources.
​
Our Workforce
As of January 1, 2021, we employed a total of 1,353 employees, excluding contractors. Our employees include, among others, licensed electrical, mechanical, structural, geotechnical and civil engineers; land surveyors; certified building officials; certified inspectors and plans examiners; licensed architects and landscape architects; certified planners; energy sales and audit specialists; installation technicians; program managers; policy advisors and information technology specialists. We believe that we attract and retain highly skilled personnel with significant industry experience and strong client relationships by offering them challenging assignments in a stable work environment combined with employee benefit programs that we believe are competitive with those offered by our competitors. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks related to the loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
The following table sets forth the number of our employees in each of our business segments and our holding company:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
------------------------------------------------+---+-------+---+-------+---+-------+--
​ | ​ | ​ | 
​ | | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018 | ​
Energy | | 748 | | 900 | | 677 | ​
Engineering and Consulting | | 531 | | 487 | | 469 | ​
Holding Company Employees (Willdan Group, Inc.) | | 74 | | 64 | | 56 | ​
Total | | 1,353 | | 1,451 | | 1,202 | ​

​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
​
While diversity, equity and inclusion has always been a part of our culture, we continue to advance efforts to integrate our principles into all aspects of our work and measure results. We believe our success depends on creating and maintaining a qualified and diverse company. As our people represent an ever-broader diversity of gender, age, race, cultural background, language, sexual orientation, ability, and national origin, we become an ever-stronger company. Our vision is to create a culture of acceptance and individuality, where all employees feel respected, included, and encouraged to bring their unique perspectives, ideas, and skills to work each day. In 2020, we established Willdan’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Working Group which identified initial goals and objectives focused on two key areas: 1) conducting a multi-pronged analysis of employee recruitment, development, engagement, and community outreach; and 2) developing and tracking key performance indicators and progress toward DEI objectives. 
We strive to attract and retain professionals with the diverse expertise our clients and teams require to solve complex challenges, as energy and infrastructure transform and expand. Our goal is for our staff, suppliers, and subcontractors to accurately reflect the communities where we live and work.

To bring more diverse and talented people to our team, we partner with professional organizations that represent and support diverse applicants. We seek out and hire minority-owned subcontractors on our projects and regularly use minority-owned suppliers. These partnerships offer economic opportunity to local, minority-owned, and disadvantaged business enterprises. We can better serve all communities by using contracting teams that mirror the culture and demographics of the communities where we work.
Workplace Safety
We recognize the critical role that all of our employees play in sustaining a safe and compliant work environment, and we understand that our leaders are responsible for the ongoing improvement of operational discipline and safety culture. Every employee and subcontractor is expected to apply this approach when performing all work activities.
Our Health and Safety Council meets monthly and our Health and Safety program is designed to address the hazards associated with our business and to prevent workplace injuries and illness.
We track and report all safety incidents. Our safety incident metrics is provided below. For context, lost-time injuries are those occurring in the workplace and resulting in an employee’s inability to work the next full workday. 

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
-----+---+------+---+------+---+-----
​ | ​ | ​ 
​ | | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
RCR | | 0.78 | | 1.06 | | 1.97
LTIR | | 0.35 | | 0.53 | | 0.66

​
A recordable case rate (RCR) describes the number of employees per 100 full-time employees that have been involved in an OSHA recordable injury or illness. The lost-time incident rate (LTIR) is the number of lost-time injuries that occurred in a given period, relative to the total number of hours worked in the same period.
Intellectual Property
We believe we have strong name recognition and that this provides us with a competitive advantage in obtaining new business. Consequently, we believe it is important to protect our brand identity through trademark registrations. The Willdan, Willdan Group, Inc., Willdan Engineering, Willdan Infrastructure, Willdan Financial Services, Willdan Energy Solutions and Willdan Homeland Services names are service marks of ours, and we have obtained a service mark for the Willdan and “W” logo. We have also obtained federal service mark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the “Willdan” name, “Willdan Group, Inc.” name and the “extending your reach” tagline. The name and logo of our proprietary software, MuniMagic+SM, are registered service marks of Willdan Financial Services, and we have registered a federal copyright for the source code for the MuniMagic+SM software. In connection with our acquisitions, we have obtained the trademark for our “LoadSEER” software, have obtained the patent for “Optimization of Microgrid Energy Use and Distribution”, have obtained the service marks for the Enerpath, Enerworks and Lime/Green Dial Design, and have obtained the registered copyright of Lime, Lime Energy, Lime Energy “less is more” design and Main Street Efficiency.
