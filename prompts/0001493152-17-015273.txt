Wall-Street.com IR Programs have been so well received by IR and Wall Street professionals that most Programs became “oversubscribed” shortly after becoming available. Some of Wall-Street.com’s best-know larger alumni include Amgen, Applied Materials, Biogen, BMC Software, Cooper Companies, Genentech, General Dynamics, Medtronic, Motorola, Raymond James Financial and Rent-A-Center.
 
Ten years later, in 1994, Wall-Street.com’s predecessor established one of the very first financial websites on the Internet and has operated continually since then under the registered trademark name, Wall-Street.com. During this time, it dramatically increased its coverage of microcap companies.
 
Consulting Services. Beginning in the first Quarter of the 2016 fiscal year the Company ceased all of its internet and IT services and began exclusively providing consulting services. These services consist of general business and financial services and are provided to existing clients of Landmark-Pegasus (a related party).
