ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
Grapefruit USA, Inc (“we”, “our”, “us”, “GBI”, “Grapefruit”, or “the Company”) was formed as a California corporation on August 28, 2017 and began operating in September 2017.
 
On July 10, 2019, Grapefruit closed the Share Exchange after the completion of all conditions subsequent contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement among the parties thereto ( “SEA”), by which Imaging3, Inc. (“IGNG”) was acquired in a reverse acquisition (the “Acquisition”) by the former shareholders of Grapefruit, the accounting acquirer. Under the terms of the SEA executed on May 31, 2019, IGNG became obligated to issue to Grapefruit’s existing shareholders that number of newly issued restricted IGNG common shares such that the former Grapefruit shareholders (now new IGNG shareholders) will own approximately 81% of the post-Acquisition IGNG common shares and the current IGNG shareholders will retain 19% of the post-Acquisition IGNG common shares. At the time of the execution of the SEA, IGNG had approximately 85,218,249 outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore, IGNG issued to Grapefruit’s shareholders 362,979,114 IGNG common shares to Grapefruit’s current shareholder on a pro rata basis with their then-current ownership of Grapefruit of which Bradley Yourist and Daniel J. Yourist own a combined 72.26%, or approximately 259,967,136 shares. Accordingly, the financial statements are prepared using the acquisition method of accounting with GBI as the accounting acquirer and IGNG treated as the legal acquirer and accounting acquiree. Because Imaging3, Inc. did not meet the accounting definition of an operating business, having only nominal assets, the reverse merger transaction was treated as a recapitalization and no goodwill was recognized.
 
The Company has applied for and received our provisional distribution renewal licensure which allows us to operate through May 13, 2021. Our annual manufacturing license has been renewed by the California Department of Health. Grapefruit has not yet applied for a license to cultivate and will not until construction has begun on our cultivation facility. We own two acres of fully entitled cannabis real property located in the Coachillin’ Industrial Cultivation and Ancillary Canna-Business Park. The location within Coachillin’ allows the Company to apply for and hold every cannabis license available under the California Cannabis laws.
 
We intend on building out the real property into a distribution, manufacturing and high-tech cultivation facility to further its goal to become a seed to sale, fully vertically integrated Cannabis and CBD product Company. Grapefruit’s plans include an indoor 22,000 square foot multi-tiered canopy and adjoining tissue culture rooms.
 
We became members of the Indian Canyon and 18th Property Association on September 19, 2017 and have an ownership interest of 1.46% based upon the 77,156 gross parcel square foot of our property located in an approximately 5.3 million square foot facility. As of December 31, 2020, the common areas continue to be built throughout the entire canna-business park and are not complete.
 
Share Exchange
 
IGNG began discussions with Grapefruit Boulevard Investments, Inc., a California corporation, on March 1, 2019, regarding the possible reverse acquisition of IGNG by Grapefruit.
 
On March 11, 2019, IGNG signed a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) to be acquired in a reverse acquisition via a share exchange agreement to be completed at some later date (the “Acquisition”) by Grapefruit. Grapefruit holds licenses issued by the State of California to manufacture and distribute cannabis products in California. Grapefruit commenced operations in mid-2018 and has received more than $450,000 in revenue from operations since Grapefruit own and operate a manufacturing plant and distribution center within the Coachillin’ Industrial Cultivation and Ancillary Canna Business Park in Desert Hot Springs near Palm Springs in Riverside County, California (the “Coachillin Site”). On Thursday, March 7, 2019 Grapefruit obtained its final permit and clearance from local authorities to commence operation of an ethanol extraction laboratory (the “Extraction Lab”) at the Coachillin site and commenced extraction and post-production processing operations. The Extraction Lab is expected to be able to produce both THC and CBD oils from either Biomass or unrefined biomass or crude oil.

Pursuant to the terms of the LOI, IGNG and Grapefruit initiated negotiations intended to result in completion of a definitive Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) encompassing all of the material terms of the Exchange Agreement during the second quarter of 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Exchange Agreement provided, among other things, that upon conclusion of the Acquisition, Grapefruit’s designees would own 81% of the then outstanding common shares of the Company and the Company’s current shareholders would own 19% of such outstanding common shares. In addition, IGNG was required to settle certain outstanding creditor obligations on terms acceptable to both Grapefruit and IGNG.
 
On July 10, 2019, IGNG effectuated a Share Exchange pursuant to that certain Exchange Agreement. On the Closing Date, IGNG issued to the Stakeholders an aggregate of three hundred sixty-two million, two hundred, twenty-nine thousand, one hundred and one (362,979,114) newly issued shares of Common Stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value, in exchange for 100% of the shares of Grapefruit’s common stock. As a result, thereof, Grapefruit became a wholly owned subsidiary of IGNG.
 
By early June 2019, the Company had shifted its focus to manufacturing cannabis distillates and edibles and distribution of such cannabis products.
 
The Company is now focused on becoming a premier manufacturer and distributor of legal cannabis products in California. We will distribute our own branded product lines as well as product produced by other manufacturers. We will continue to service the wholesale cannabis marketplace by selling bulk Honey THC Oil, Flower and Trim to manufactures and other distributors throughout California. We will also offer our expert cannabis advice to others in connection with their branding, compliance, packaging, extraction, edible manufacturing and distribution logistics efforts.
 
Auctus Financing
 
On May 31, 2019, the Company executed the SPA with Auctus pursuant to the terms of which the Company agreed to sell $4,000,000 of the Notes and issue $6,200,000 of callable warrants (the “Warrants” and, together with the Notes, the “Securities”) to Auctus. Auctus is the Selling Security Holder. In addition, on May 31, 2019, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with Auctus (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) whereby we are obligated to file a registration statement to register the resale of the shares underlying the Securities. On July 25, 2019 (as amended on January 17, 2020), a registration statement was filed to comply with the Registration Rights Agreement . Pursuant to the SPA, Auctus became obligated to purchase the $4,000,000 of Notes from Grapefruit in four tranches as follows: $600,000 at the SPA closing, which was funded on June 6, 2019; the second tranche of $1,422,750 on the day IGNG filed the registration statement, which was funded on August 16, 2019; the third tranche of $1,030,000 was funded the day the SEC declares the registration statement effective and the fourth tranche of $1 million was funded 90 days after effectiveness. As of December 31, 2020, all tranches of this financing were completed. The Company has received gross proceeds of $4,052,750.
Industry Overview
 
Global consumer spending on legal cannabis in 2018 showed a growth rate of 20 percent in sales of cannabis in regulated markets. Cannabis sales are on track to increase 36 percent to $14.9 billion in 2019 and reach $40 billion by 2024 according to the “State of Legal Cannabis Markets” Report released by Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics. This report points to growth in the cannabis markets while underlining the challenges that face the sector. The “Total Cannabinoid Market” (“TCM”) in the United States, which includes medical and recreational cannabis sales in regulated dispensaries, plus sales of FDA-approved pharmaceuticals and hemp-based CBD products.
 
Most notably, in 2018 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved GW Pharmaceutical’s Epidiolex and passed the 2018 Farm Bill legalizing hemp and cannabidiol oil derived from hemp as long as it contained less than 0.3% THC. According to State of Legal Cannabis Markets, 7th Edition, by Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics, the 2018 Farm Bill allows pharmacies, extraction labs, and general retailers to sell CBD-based products in all 50 states, which is expected to enhance the TCM. In the U.S. alone, sales of CBD products in all channels are expected to reach $20 billion by 2024.

In 2018 the legal cannabis industry experienced one of its slowest annual expansion rates since Colorado launched the adult-use era in 2014.
 
In California, its legal spending on cannabis fell, from $3 billion in 2017 to $2.5 billion, in the year in which it implemented an adult-use regulatory regime. A key takeaway from the California market is that highly restrictive regulations and high tax rates are hurting the legal market’s ability to compete with the illicit market. The barriers to enter into the legal cannabis market are also increasing in California because its temporary cannabis licensing scheme has ended. Currently any license applicant must now wait a protracted amount of time before the applicant receives its license and must wait a year in some cases for the application to make its way through the local and state licensing authorities.
 
According to the “State of Legal Cannabis Markets” Report, other key trends in the United States Legal Cannabis Markets include:
 

● | Total legal cannabis spending in regulated dispensaries in the U.S. topped $9.8 billion in 2018, and is forecast to grow to $30 billion in 2024, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20 percent. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Investment capital raised by cannabis companies more than quadrupled to $14 billion in 2018, according to Viridian Capital Advisors. 
● | Despite a 55 percent decline in 2018 in New Cannabis Ventures’ Global Cannabis Stock Index, the five largest Canadian licensed producers closed the first quarter of 2019 at a combined market capitalization of $48 billion. 
● | A total of 13 state markets will have passed the $1 billion mark in total annual legal cannabis spending by the end of 2024—by the end of 2018, only three had done so (California, Colorado and Washington). 

Grapefruit’s Competitive Advantage in the Industry
 
Grapefruit holds its State of California provisional licensing from the Bureau of Cannabis Control and the California Department of Public Health. The Company has its permanent annually renewable provisional license as opposed to a temporary license. The Company expects the annual renewal to be a non-intrusive and scaled down as opposed to what the renewal process was previously. The Company is one of the earliest registered distribution companies with the State of California to have an annually renewable license as opposed to the temporary licenses previously granted. In January 2019, the State of California revised its cannabis regulations to restrict the ability of companies to become licensed businesses.
 
California has three distinct regulatory agencies that govern the issuance of cultivation licenses, manufacturing licenses and distribution licenses. In order to foster the then-nascent commercial cannabis industry, the State of California initially allowed each regulatory agency to grant temporary licensing to companies with very minimal regulatory requirements and oversight. In fact, a new or then-existing cannabis company only had to show State Regulators that their local city was allowing their commercial cannabis business to operate which was an uncomplicated task. A temporary license was a conditional license that allowed a cannabis business to engage in commercial cannabis activity for a period of 120 days. The State granted operators 90-day extensions of their temporary license while final cannabis regulations were being developed and officially implemented by the State.
 
On January 1, 2019, the State of California eliminated the temporary cannabis licensing scheme. The impact of this regulatory restriction prevents all new cannabis companies from starting their operations without first applying for, and obtaining, a provisional license from the appropriate regulatory agency. The same regulatory restriction prevents existing, but unregulated, cannabis companies from continuing to engage in commercial cannabis operations without shutting down while applying for, and obtaining, an annual license from the appropriate regulatory agency. The elimination of the temporary license scheme significantly thinned out the number of commercial cannabis businesses operating in the State. This was due to the regulatory requirements required to apply for an annual license which include compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, provision of a Hazardous Waste Disposal Plan and the multitude of other regulatory requirements to operate a compliant cannabis business.

The regulatory changes have impacted the ability of new businesses to enter the marketplace and compete with Grapefruit. However, none of Grapefruit’s commercial cannabis businesses have been impacted by the regulatory changes to the marketplace.
 
Grapefruit owns two acres of fully entitled cannabis real property located in the Coachillin’ Industrial Cultivation and Ancillary Canna-Business Park. Grapefruit understood the State’s regulatory burdens and expense for commercial cannabis businesses to successfully operate. For example, the State requires cannabis business to provide 24 hour-per-day on-site armed security for their facility. This is a shared expense of the property Coachillin property owners. In addition, Coachillin property owners pay agricultural power rates of nine (9) cents per kilowatt hour which is significantly less than what others pay for power. The location within Coachillin allows the Company to apply for and hold every cannabis license available under the California Cannabis laws.
 
Grapefruit intends on building out the real property into a distribution, manufacturing and high-tech cultivation facility to further its goal to become a seed to sale, fully vertically integrated Cannabis and CBD product Company. Grapefruit’s plans include an indoor 22,000 square foot multi-tiered canopy and adjoining tissue culture rooms. The canopy is estimated to produce thousands of pounds of the highest quality indoor cultivars of cannabis annually.
 
The Coachillin’ property owners’ association, which Grapefruit is a part of, will feature a unique drive through retail cannabis dispensary right off highway 10 on the way to Coachella and Palm Springs. Grapefruit will have the right to sell its cannabis products directly to the public through the drive through dispensary. Coachillin’ will also feature a cannabis hotel and music stadium and other visitor areas. By Grapefruit locating in Coachillin, the company gains instant exposure to thousands of hotel guests and other cannabis visitors that will visit the Coachillin’ cannabis friendly resort over time. Grapefruit believes that the canna-tourism industry will mature to be similar to the wine industry and can capitalize on this industry by virtue of its location within the Canna-business park.
 
Distribution
 
Grapefruit initially obtained its California wholesale recreational and medicinal cannabis distribution license on January 4, 2018. Thereafter, Grapefruit met all of its ongoing regulatory requirements and filed its application for an annual distribution license. In May 2019, Grapefruit was granted its provisional distribution license, thereby acquiring the regulatory foundation necessary to expand its distribution business. From July 2018 through 2020, Grapefruit used its distribution license to sell bulk cannabis flowers and trim to other distributors and to manufacturers to satisfy their own raw materials requirements. In addition, Grapefruit sold flowers, vape cartridges and concentrates to licensed retailers throughout California.
 
In California, cannabis cultivators and manufactures are prohibited from selling their products – e.g., flowers or edibles - directly into the marketplace. These companies are required to use a licensed distributor, such as Grapefruit. Grapefruit’s distribution license affords it a twofold strategic advantage: first, to market and sell its own cannabis product lines to retailers throughout California; and second to buy and resell bulk cannabis oil, flower and trim as an unfettered middleman to any properly licensed customer anywhere in California that it identifies a profit opportunity.
 
Additionally, after marijuana plants are mature, they’re harvested within a certain time frame to keep the product fresh. Throughout the growth cycle and during this specific time period after the plant has been harvested, a grower will trim the plant of its leaves, focusing mostly on the remaining buds. Specifically speaking, trim is defined as the excess snipping of leaves from buds of marijuana plants. Note that leftover product can still be used to make extractions, tinctures, hash and edibles, so growers and trimmers alike can always increase sales with a larger product offering.

Manufacturing
 
The Company owns a fully licensed ethanol extraction facility in the City of Desert Hot Springs, CA. The Company owns and operates a Type 6 Ethanol Extraction Plant which removes the essential cannabis compounds, such as THC Distillate, that we, and others use, to produce cannabis products.
 
Grapefruit’s extraction lab produces high quality distillate or “Honey Oil” from trim that Grapefruit sources utilizing its distribution license as set forth above. THC Honey Oil is a fundamental cannabis commodity which serves as the active ingredient in products from infused edibles to tinctures/creams to the cartridges used in vapes or e-cigarettes. Honey Oil sells in the wholesale marketplace at approximately $6,250 to $8,800 per liter. Pricing is dependent on quantity purchased as well as other market factors such as the availability and cost of the underlying trim – the raw cannabis material from which Grapefruit produces oil. Grapefruit began extraction operations in May 2019. Plans to expand the lab’s production capacity were altered based on the demands of the marketplace. Additionally, the installation of lab equipment would have interfered with the production capacities of the lab. The Company decided to manufacture its own RSO (“Rick Simpson Oil”) infused product line as well as prepare the lab for the production run of its patchless patch topical cream. Grapefruit chose to set up its extraction laboratory in the City of Desert Hot Springs because the City does not tax the manufacture of oil by Grapefruit at its Desert Hot Springs extraction facility, thereby providing Grapefruit with an additional competitive advantage.
 
THC Distillate is an all-purpose product that is used in the manufacture of everything from cannabis edibles to “e-cigarette” vape carts to tinctures, to creams and pre-rolled cannabis “joints”. We sell our distillate in California to companies that manufacturer their own product lines of edibles and/or vape cards. We also intend to use our own Distillate to produce our branded line of edibles and vape carts to allow us to control the quality of our product lines. We also manufacture marijuana cigarettes (which we market as pre-rolls) for sale into the retail marketplace. This manufacturing process is streamlined through the use of machinery and our employees who inspect each marijuana cigarette to ensure quality control. We have partnered with different manufactures in California to manufacture our line of branded products we intend to distribute and/or sell into the marketplace. We do not restrict our needs to a single manufacturer or distribution company as we maintain ongoing relationships with Tier 1 vendors across the cannabis eco-system.
 
Branding
 
We package and brand cannabis products. One of the key elements to our branding strategy is performing an analysis on a product’s competitor(s) currently in the retail space and working to make our product stand out. We work on pricing strategies, boutique branding elements and other ways to differentiate when shelf space gets limited and retailers slow down on taking certain product classes.
 
Hourglass by Grapefruit commonly referred to as the Company’s “Patchless Patch” Cannabinoid Delivery System
 
The Company is currently manufacturing, marketing, and selling “Hourglass™” by Grapefruit, its patented time release THC + Cannabinoid delivery cream commonly referred to as the “Patchless Patch”. Due to complications beyond our control with our former licensed cannabis testing lab partner, CannaSafe, the Company was significantly delayed in its efforts to sell Hourglass into the retail marketplace. The Bureau of Cannabis Control shut down CannaSafe for issues that has nothing to do with the Company. However, CannaSafe was in the process of final regulatory testing for Hourglass when it was shut down. This, in turn, delayed our efforts and timeline to bring Hourglass to the retail marketplace. The Company was ultimately forced to seek out a new State Certified Laboratory and then had to start from ground zero working with the new laboratory’s science team to train them to properly test the Hourglass cream.
 
Hourglass provides users with a defined “time-released” amount of THC and CBD through the skin to provide the user with the full synergistic and holistic benefits of cannabis. Hourglass™ is an innovative THC and Cannabinoid delivery system that has solved the inherent difficulties of efficient skin absorption of THC and other cannabinoids. Grapefruit developed this innovative product as an efficient means to deliver THC to those who need it. Hourglass™ is currently available in licensed retail and mobile cannabis dispensaries in Los Angeles County, California, USA. Hourglass™ is not intended for use to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease and we are not claiming otherwise.

The Company has also developed a 2018 Farm Bill compliant hemp based CBD version of Hourglass™. We anticipate that the CBD version of Hourglass will be retail ready for sale throughout the United States and Internationally in the second quarter of 2021. The 2018 Farm Bill compliant hemp version of Hourglass™ contains no THC whatsoever which allows for greater flexibility to market and sell this version in traditional sale’s channels. We anticipate that the CBD version of Hourglass will be widely distributed domestically because there is no Federal prohibition on CBD sales across state lines throughout the United States. The Hemp-derived version of Hourglass™ is not intended for use to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease and we are not claiming otherwise.
 
Sugar Stoned
 
Grapefruit acquired the Sugar Stoned® brand in the winter of 2018 for use through the winter of 2021. We began the manufacturing process and research and development process for our products immediately, and recently began to sell and distribute Sugar Stoned branded products throughout California. Retail cannabis product consumers can purchase Sugar Stoned infused gummies that have been tested and are certified to be pesticide and heavy metal free by a third-party laboratory before being released at retail. Sugar Stoned brand is now a Grapefruit portfolio brand consisting of a premium quality cannabis infused gummy line with eight different flavors: Blue Raspberry, Cherry, Grape, Peach, Pineapple, Sour Apple, Strawberry and Watermelon.
Rainbow Dreams
 
Grapefruit recently launched a new life-style brand designed specifically for the recreational cannabis marketplace called “Rainbow Dreams.” The Rainbow Dreams brand captures the “anything goes party vibe” of the 1970s by offering an array of cannabis products such as a line of vape cartridges with unique cannabis strains combined with all natural flavors for a no-burn experience compared to the traditional or earlier generation cartridges which burn at much higher temperatures and provide the user with a burning sensation when inhaling. Rainbow Dreams fills a niche in the marketplace – a top shelf quality product line that we expect to be competitively priced. The Company made a strategic decision to delay the THC and CBD of infused gummies and mints due to saturation of the marketplace for these types of products.
 
The Company has manufactured an infused product known as “RSO”, which is commonly known as Rick Simpson Oil and is used in the medicinal marketplace. The Company’s RSO product line is currently being marketed to cannabis retailers.
 
Hourglass
 
Full Spectrum THC+ Cannabinoid Time Release Topical Delivery Cream provides users with a full body, synergistic entourage effect that was only available by smoking, vaping or consuming cannabis. This is the first and only patented Topical Cream that scientifically delivers the full effects of THC combined with a broad range of cannabinoids for your overall health, wellness, and well-being. Laboratory tested with complete results available on every package via a designated QR Code. There is no other topical cream product on the market with our patented and novel delivery technology that provides users with the holistic benefits of the entourage effect of THC+CBD, CBN, CBG, Delta8, THCV and CBE. Users will no longer be prevented from enjoying the many benefits of cannabis without eating an edible, using a tincture or lighting a joint, pipe or vape and will be able to discreetly apply additional cream for any desired effect. The Company is currently in the process of adapting our proprietary manufacturing protocols to our new hemp-derived CBD cream.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company filed trademark and service mark applications with the State of California to protect its Company name as well as its Rainbow Dreams and Sugar Stoned cannabis product names. The Company received the following Registration Statements from the California Secretary of State:

1. | On August 20, 2019, the Secretary of State of the State of California issued the Company its Registration of Service Mark, Registration No. Y1GZNV6, for its corporate name, Grapefruit, thereby protecting its Service Mark and line of business from other competitors within the industry. The term of the Grapefruit Service Mark Registration extends to and includes August 19, 2024. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | On August 20, 2019, the Secretary of State of the State of California issued to Grapefruit its Registration of Trademark, Registration No. Y3EMZM6, for its Rainbow Dreams cannabis products name under “Cartridges sold filled with cannabis infused natural flavorings in liquid form for electronic cigarettes.” The term of the Rainbow Dreams Trademark Registration extends to and includes August 19, 2024. 
3. | On August 21, 2019, the Secretary of State of the State of California issued to Grapefruit its Registration of Trademark, Verification No. Q6A98B3, for its Sugar Stoned cannabis product name under “Cannabis Infused Cookies and Candies.” The term of the Trademark Registration extends to and includes August 20, 2024. 
4. | On February 4, 2021, the Secretary of State of the State of California issued to Grapefruit its Registration of Trademark, Registration Nos. 02009331 and 02009332, for its Hourglass patented time release THC + Cannabinoid delivery cream under “Cannabis infused skin cream.” The term of the Trademark Registrations extends to and includes February 3, 2026. 

 
The Company currently maintains a portfolio of trade secrets relating to the formulas for its CBD gummies, vaporization cartridges and oils as well as its proprietary manufacturing process for its Hourglass creams.
 
Tolling
 
We expect to enter into toll processing agreements by which cultivators will provide us with their dried biomass (i.e., Trim) which we then process at our extraction facility into finished distillate. In exchange, we provide 50% of the finished product to the cultivator. The cultivator is free to use our distribution service to sell their finished product or transfer the finished product to another distributor.
Packaging
 
We provide packaging services to re-integrate formally unlicensed products back into the legal marketplace. The space on packaging is limited due to compliance laws. We spend a significant amount of time working out these issues in a pre-production phase. Our goal is to keep a brand’s original design work while complying with al the government regulations. We devote serious efforts to re-brand an unlicensed product to quickly and efficiently re-integrate it into the retail space.
Marketing and Sales
 
We have retained employees with cannabis-related experience in product manufacturing, branding, marketing and retail sales in the State of California. We have a strategic relationship with a full service traditional and digital marketing agency that will promote our company and products. We have a multi-pronged approach to marketing our Company and its branded product lines: (1) social media – including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter; (2) influencers who are expected to promote our branded products directly to recreational cannabis users; (3) attendance at specific industry events that are designed to promote our company to both macro and micro targeted audiences; (4) targeted radio advertising designed to reach the recreational marketplace and static marketing (e.g., well placed bill board advertising); and (5) use of our sales force for the personal touch required to obtain shelf-space in all recreational and medicinal dispensaries.
 
The Company employs inside salespersons for retail, and outside salespeople for wholesale purchases. Additionally, the Company maintains an online digital platform where customers may purchase the Company’s products.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Principal Suppliers
 
In general, raw materials essential to our business are readily available from multiple sources. So far, we have been able to source the materials required to manufacture our THC Distillate as well as our edibles and vape cartridges. Our products use both non-cannabis and cannabis raw materials. We have the entire United States for the sourcing non-cannabis raw materials – such as terpenes, which are the compounds from plant extracts that provide the unique flavor profile in cannabis products, and cells, which are the industry standard vaporization carts. The California cannabis marketplace is diverse, and we have developed the relationships with other companies to ensure the consistent availability of the raw materials.
 
Because we have no direct control over these suppliers, interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion. In addition, if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary products or raw materials, we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such raw materials or products or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers. In such events, we could experience interruptions, delays, increased costs or quality control problems, or be unable to sell the applicable products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue.
 
Competition
 
The cannabis industry is subject to significant competition and pricing pressures. We may experience significant competitive pricing pressures as well as competitive products and services providers. Several significant competitors may offer products and/or services with prices that may match or are lower than ours. We believe that the products and services we offer are generally competitive with those offered by other cannabis companies. It is possible that one or more of our competitors could develop a significant research advantage over us that allows them to provide superior products or pricing, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Continued pricing pressure or improvements in research and shifts in customer preferences away from natural supplements could adversely impact our customer base or pricing structure and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Additionally, CBD is a naturally occurring cannabinoid constituent of cannabis. It was discovered in 1940 and is known to exhibit neuroprotective properties in many experimental systems. However, development of CBD as a drug has been confounded by the following: 1) low potency; 2) a large number of molecular targets; 3) marginal pharmacokinetic properties; and 4) designation as a schedule 1 controlled substance. We view that companies specializing in the sale, distribution and manufacturing of CBD based products as some of our stronger competitors based on recent laws and regulatory schemes.
 
Government Approvals and Regulations
 
The formulation, manufacturing, processing, labelling, packaging, advertising and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by several federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). These activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. The FDA regulates the processing, formulation, safety, manufacture, packaging, labelling and distribution of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, and herbs) and cosmetics, whereas the FTC has jurisdiction to regulate the advertising of these products.
 
The FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged and held in compliance with strict rules, and require quality control provisions similar to those in the GMP regulations for drugs. The FDA could in the future choose to inspect one of our facilities for compliance with these regulations and could cause non-compliant products made or held in the facility to be subject to FDA enforcement actions.
 
The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA and their regulation of foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics may increase or become more restrictive in the future. Additional legislation could be passed which would impose substantial new regulatory requirements for dietary supplements, potentially raising our costs and hindering our business. We do not believe our current products are subject to the FDCA as our products are not intended to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease.

Our advertising is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In recent years the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of dietary supplement and weight loss products and companies. Additionally, some states also permit advertising and labelling laws to be enforced by private attorney generals, who may seek relief for consumers, seek class action certifications, seek class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by us. Any of these types of adverse actions against us by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
In addition to FDA and FTC regulations, our products may face further regulation under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to our obtaining marketing approval for our products in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our products to be marketed or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. In the case of countries with similar obstacles, we would be unable to market our product candidates in countries in the near future or perhaps at all if the laws and regulations in those countries do not change.
 
Additionally, the Company is also subject to California law regarding dissemination of information via advertising. Mainly, these rules and regulations relate to directing advertisements to people aged 21 years and older. The type of advertising the Company expects to conduct and pursue is similar to how alcohol companies direct their advertising and marketing efforts.
 
Controlled Substance Regulation
 
At some point our products may be developed and be subject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations and failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, may adversely affect the results of our business operations, both during clinical development and post approval, and our financial condition.
 
Certain products we may develop could contain controlled substances as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA. Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, not currently “accepted medical use” in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II drugs is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled without a new prescription. We do not intend to produce “controlled substances” at this time, due to regulatory complications.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 14 full-time employees. Grapefruit has 4 employees at its lab facilities. One of the lab employees is responsible for managing onsite operations at the Warehouse. Grapefruit has a total of 5 inside sales and branding employees as well as 2 employees for operational support. Finally, the Company has 3 outside salespeople located in Northern California. These salespeople are in charge of Grapefruit’s bulk flower and trim sales. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or other collective bargaining groups at this point in time, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We currently plan to retain and utilize the services of outside consultants for additional research, testing, regulatory, legal compliance and other services on an as needed basis.
