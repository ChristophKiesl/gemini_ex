ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
  
     In September of 2006, the Company began operating as Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation (the “Company”). The Company’s predecessor was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1994. The Company has authorized capital of 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share.
  
 Our principal place of business is 1021 N Kellogg Street, Kennewick, Washington, 99336. Our telephone number is (509) 736-4000. Our corporate website address is http://www.isotopeworld.com. Our common stock is currently listed for quotation on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbol “ADMD.”
  
  Overview
  
 The Company is a late stage radiation oncology medical device company engaged in the development of its yttrium-90 based brachytherapy device, RadioGel™, for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. A prominent team of radiochemists, scientists and engineers, collaborating with strategic partners, including national laboratories, universities and private corporations, lead the Company’s development efforts. The Company’s overall vision is to globally empower physicians, medical researchers and patients by providing them with new isotope technologies that offer safe and effective treatments for cancer.
  
 The Company’s current focus is on the development of its RadioGel™ device. RadioGel™ is an injectable particle-gel, for brachytherapy radiation treatment of cancerous tumors in people and animals. RadioGel™ is comprised of a hydrogel, or a substance that is liquid at room temperature and then gels when reaching body temperature after injection into a tumor. In the gel are small, one micron, yttrium-90 phosphate particles (“Y-90”). Once injected, these inert particles are locked in place inside the tumor by the gel, delivering a very high local radiation dose. The radiation is beta, consisting of high-speed electrons. These electrons only travel a short distance so the device can deliver high radiation to the tumor with minimal dose to the surrounding tissue. Optimally, patients can go home immediately following treatment without the risk of radiation exposure to family members. Since Y-90 has a half-life of 2.7 days, the radioactively drops to 5% of its original value after ten days.

 The Company’s lead brachytherapy products, including RadioGel™, incorporate patented technology developed for Battelle Memorial Institute (“Battelle”) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a leading research institute for government and commercial customers. Battelle has granted the Company an exclusive license to patents covering the manufacturing, processing and applications of RadioGel™ (the “Battelle License”). Other intellectual property protection includes proprietary production processes and trademark protection in 17 countries. The Company plans to continue efforts to develop new refinements on the production process, and the product and application hardware, as a basis for future patents.
  
 The Company is currently focusing on obtaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to market and sell RadioGel™ as a Class II medical device. The Company first requested FDA approval of RadioGel™ in June 2013, at which time the FDA classified RadioGel™ as a medical device. The Company then followed with a 510(k) submission which the FDA responded with a request for a physician letter of substantial equivalence and a reformatted 510(k) summary, which the Company provided January 2014. In February 2014 the FDA ruled the device as not substantially equivalent due to a lack of predicate device and it was classified to Class III. The Company is currently developing test plans to address issues raised by the FDA in connection with the Company’s previous submissions regarding RadioGel™, including developing specific test plans and specific indication of use. The Company intends to request FDA approval to apply for de novo classification of RadioGel™, which would reclassify the device from a Class III device to a Class II device, further simplifying the regulatory path.
  
 In previous FDA submittals, the Company proposed applying RadioGel™ for a very broad range of cancer therapies, referred to as Indication for Use. The FDA has requested that the Company reduce its Indications for Use. To comply with that request, the Company has expanded its Medical Advisory Board (“MAB”) and engaged doctors from respected hospitals who have evaluated the candidate cancer therapies based on three criteria: (1) potential for FDA approval and successful therapy; (2) notable advantage over current therapies; and (3) probability of wide spread acceptance by the medical community.
  
 The MAB selected eighteen applications for RadioGel™, each of which meet the criteria described above. This large number confirms the wide applicability of the device and defines the path for future business growth. The Company intends to apply to the FDA for a single Indication for Use, followed by subsequent applications for additional Indications for Use. The initial application should facilitate each subsequent application, and the testing for many of the subsequent applications could be conducted in parallel, depending on available resources.
  
 The MAB selected the treatment of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers for the first Indication for Use to be submitted to the FDA. According to the American Cancer Society, one out of every three new cancers diagnosed in the U.S. is a cancerous skin lesion of this type, representing 5.5 million tumors diagnosed annually. The MAB believes RadioGel™ has the potential to be the preferred treatment in a reasonable number of cases in a very large market.
  
  The Company’s, IsoPet Solutions division was established in May 2016 to focus on the veterinary oncology market. The Company has engaged four different university veterinarian hospitals to begin using RadioGel™ for treatment of four different cancer types in dogs and cats. Washington State University Veterinary Hospital has tested one cat to demonstrate the procedures and the absence of any significant toxicity effect. The other three centers are expected to begin therapy during the second quarter of 2017 after their internal administrative review process is completed.
  
 These animal therapies will focus on creating labels that describe the procedures in detail as a guide to future veterinarians. The labels will be voluntarily submitted to the FDA for review. They will then be used as data for future FDA applications in the medical sector and as key intellectual property for licensing to private veterinary clinics. In 2018, Dr. Alice Villalobos, the Chair of our Veterinarian Advisory Board, will be the first licensee of these therapies in her private clinic to demonstrate the business model.
  
 The Company anticipates that future profit will be derived from direct sales of RadioGel™ and related services, and from licensing to private medical and veterinary clinics in the U.S. and internationally.

  Financing and Strategy
  
 Research and development of RadioGel™ and other products in the Company’s brachytherapy product line has been funded with proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities as well as a series of grants. The Company requires funding of approximately $1.5 million annually to maintain current operating activities. Over the next 12 to 24 months, the Company believes it will cost approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million to fund: (1) the FDA approval process and initial deployment of RadioGel™ and other brachytherapy products, and (2) initiate regulatory approval processes outside of the United States. The continued deployment of RadioGel™ and the Company’s other brachytherapy products and a worldwide regulatory approval effort will require additional resources and personnel. The principal variables in the timing and amount of spending for the brachytherapy products in the next 12 to 24 months will be the FDA’s classification of the Company’s brachytherapy products, including RadioGel™, as Class II or Class III devices (or otherwise) and any requirements for additional studies which may possibly include clinical studies. Thereafter, the principal variables in the amount of the Company’s spending and its financing requirements would be the timing of any approvals and the nature of the Company’s arrangements with third parties for manufacturing, sales, distribution and licensing of those products and the products’ success in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Company intends to fund its activities through strategic transactions such as licensing and partnership agreements or additional capital raises.
  
 Following receipt of required regulatory approvals and financing in the U.S., the Company intends to outsource material aspects of manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing. Outside of the U.S., the Company intends to pursue licensing arrangements and/or partnerships to facilitate its global commercialization strategy.
  
  In the longer-term, subject to the Company receiving adequate funding, regulatory approval for RadioGel™ and other brachytherapy products, and thereafter being able to successfully commercialize its brachytherapy products, the Company intends to consider resuming research efforts with respect to other products and technologies intended to help improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other illnesses
  
 Based on the Company’s financial history since inception, its auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has limited revenue, nominal cash, and has accumulated deficits since inception. If the Company cannot obtain sufficient additional capital, the Company will be required to delay the implementation of its business strategy and may not be able to continue operations.
  
  Product Features
  
 The Company’s RadioGel™ device has the following product features:
  
   ●
 Beta particles only travel a short distance so the device can deliver high radiation to the tumor with minimal dose to the nearby normal tissues. In medical terms Y-90 beta emitter has a high efficacy rate;

 
   ●
 Benefitting from the short penetration distance, the patient can go home immediately with no fear of exposure to family members, and there is a greatly reduced radiation risk to the doctor. A simple plastic tube around the syringe, gloves and safety glasses are all that is required. Other gamma emitting products require much more protection;

 
   ●
 A 2.7-day half-life means that only 5% of the radiation remains after ten days. This is in contrast to the industry-standard gamma irradiation product, which has a half-life of 17 days;

 
   ●
 The short half-life also means that any medical waste can be stored for thirty days then disposed as normal hospital waste;

   ●
 RadioGel™ can be administered with small diameter needles (27-gauge) so there is minimal damage to the normal tissue. This is in contrast to the injection of metal seeds, which does considerable damage; and

 
   ●
 After about 120 days the gel resorbs by a normal biological cycle, called the Krebs Cycle. The only remaining evidence of the treatment are phosphate particles so small in diameter that it requires a high-resolution microscope to find them. This is in contrast to permanent presence of metal seeds.

 
  Steps from Production to Therapy
  
  Device Production
  
 During the next two years, the Company intends to outsource material aspects of manufacturing and distribution. As future product volume increases, the Company will reassess its make-buy decision on manufacturing and will analyze the cost/benefit of a centrally located facility.
  
  Production of the Hydrogel
  
 RadioGel™ is manufactured with a proprietary process under ventilated sterile hood by following strict Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, procedures. It is made in large batches that are frozen for up to three months. When the product is ready to ship, a small quantity of the gel is dissolved in a sterile saline solution. It is then passed through an ultra-fine filter to ensure sterility.
  
  Production of the Yttrium-90 Phosphate Particles
  
 The Y-90 particles are produced with simple ingredients via a proprietary process, again following strict GLP procedures. They are then mixed into a phosphate-buffered saline solution. They can be produced in large batches for several shipments. The number of particles per shipment is determined by the dose prescribed by the doctor.
  
  Shipment
  
 RadioGel™ is shipped in two containers, one with a solution of the gel and the other with a solution of the particles. Before shipment they are subjected to sterility testing, again by strict procedures. The vial with the Y-90 is put through a special radiation calibrator, which measures beta particles. The vials can be shipped via FedEx or UPS by following the proper protocols.
 At the User
  
 The user receives the two vials. The solution containing the RadioGel™ is mixed with the solution containing the Y-90 particles. This is then shaken to ensure homogeneity and withdrawn into a syringe. The quantities that are mixed are calculated from the information on the product label.

 The specific injection technique depends on the Indication for Use. For small tumors, one centimeter in diameter or less, the cancer is treated with a single injection. For larger tumors, the cancer is treated with a series of small injections from the same syringe.
  
  Principal Markets
  
 The Company is currently pursuing two synergistic business sectors, medical and veterinary, each of which are summarized below.
  
  Medical Sector
  
 Brachytherapy is the use of radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radiation source inside or next to the treatment area. According to the 2014 MEDraysintell report, the global market for brachytherapy reached US$ 680 million in 2013 and is projected to reach $2.4 billion by 2030. It is estimated that the U.S. market represents approximately half of the global market. The Company believes there are significant opportunities in prostate, breast, liver, pancreatic, head and neck cancers. The 2014 U.S. estimated new cases of cancer according to the American Cancer Society are 233,000 prostate, 235,030 breast, 31,190 liver, and 46,420 pancreas. 
  
 RadioGel™ is currently fully developed, requiring only FDA approval before commercialization. The Company has been seeking FDA approval of RadioGel™ for almost four years. The principal issue preventing approval is that the Company attempted to obtain regulatory approval for a broad range of Indications for Use, including all non-resectable cancers, without sufficient supporting data.

 Building on the FDA’s ruling of RadioGel™ as a device, the Company is currently developing test plans to address issues raised in the Company’s prior FDA submittal regarding RadioGel™. The Company intends to request FDA approval to submit RadioGel™ for de novo classification, which would reclassify the device from a Class III device to a Class II device, and accelerate the regulatory approval path.
  
 After analyzing the Company’s data and the last four years of communication from the FDA, the Company has taken the following steps:
  
   1.
 Under new leadership, the Company is implementing all past recommendations from the FDA. The Company intends to narrow the Indications for Use, will provide test plans for FDA review to respond to answer all previous FDA questions, and will request a pre-submission meeting;

 
   2.
 Prepare a pre-submission request document and FDA meeting request to obtain feedback on the test plans in order to initiate testing, to present the proposed content for the final application and to request permission to submit a de novo;

 
   3.
 Submit an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) to obtain permission to conduct human clinical studies; and

 
   4.
 File a de novo or Pre-Market Approval application.

 
 The critical path is the required testing – in vitro, animal testing, human clinical studies – all of which is resource dependent.
  
 In previous submittals, the Company proposed applying a very broad range of cancer therapies, referred to as Indications for Use, to RadioGel™. The FDA has strongly advised the Company to reduce its Indications for Use. To comply with that request, the Company has expanded its MAB, consisting of Drs. Barry D. Pressman (Chairman), Albert DeNittis, Howard Sandler, and Darrell Fisher.
  
 The MAB evaluated the candidate cancer therapies based on three criteria: (i) the potential for FDA approval and successful therapy; (ii) notable advantages of RadioGel™ over current therapies; and (iii) the likelihood that RadioGel™ can be widely accepted by the medical community and profitably commercialized.
  
 The MAB selected eighteen Indications for Use for RadioGel™, each of which meets the above-mentioned criteria. These eighteen Indications for Use are listed below. This large number confirms the wide applicability of the device and defines the path for future growth. The Company intends to apply to the FDA for a single Indication for Use, followed by subsequent applications for additional Indications for Use. The initial application should facilitate each subsequent application, and the testing for many of the subsequent applications could be conducted in parallel, depending on available resources.
  
 
● Skin cancer ● Involved lymph nodes ● Bladder ● Liver ● Localized prostate ● Pancreas ● Head and neck (including sino-nasal and oropharyngeal) ● Ocular melanoma | ● Non-dendritic brain ● Pediatric cancers – several types ● Rectal ● Gynecological ● Spinal ● Recurrent esophageal ● Breast cancer resection cavity ● Anaplastic thyroid
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 After thorough review to prioritize indications, the MAB has selected basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma (skin cancers) as the first Indication for Use to be presented to the FDA. According to American Cancer Society, one out of every three new cancers diagnosed in the U.S. is a cancerous skin lesion of this type, representing 5.5 million tumors annually. The MAB believes RadioGel™ will be the preferred treatment in a reasonable number of cases in a very large market.

  Veterinary Sector
  
 There are about 150 million pet dogs and cats in the United States. Nearly one-half of dogs and one-third of cats are diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. The Veterinary Oncology & Hermatology Center in Norwalk, Connecticut, reports that cancer is the number one natural cause of death in older cats and dogs, accounting for nearly 50 percent of pet deaths each year. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports that half of the dogs ten years or older will die because of cancer. The National Cancer Institute reports that about six million dogs are diagnosed with cancer each year, translating to more than 16,000 a day. The average cost of treating tumors in dogs using radiation is $5,000 to 7,000, according to petcarerx.com.
  
 The Company’s IsoPet operating division focuses on the veterinary oncology market. Dr. Alice Villalobos, a founding member of the Veterinary Cancer Society and the Chair of our Veterinary Medicine Advisory Board, has been providing guidance to management regarding this market.
  
 Since the FDA has classified RadioGel™ as a device, the Company can implement future improvements in the product and the application techniques to further benefit animals and to strengthen our intellectual property, without any further FDA approvals.
 
 The Company currently intends to utilize university veterinary hospitals for therapy development, given that veterinary hospitals offer superior and plentiful veterinarians and students, a large number of animal patients, radioactive material handling licenses, and are respected by private veterinary centers and hospitals.
 
 The Company has recently engaged four different university veterinarian hospitals to begin using RadioGel™ for four different cancer types in dogs and cats. Each veterinary hospital will focus on a different cancer therapy:
 
   ●
 Washington State University – feline sarcoma, possibly followed by canine sarcoma;

   ●
 University of Missouri – soft tissue carcinoma, possibly followed by localized prostate;

   ●
 University of Florida – lymph nodes, followed by liver cancer; and

   ●
 Colorado State University – oral squamous cancer.

 
 Washington State University Veterinary Hospital has tested one cat to demonstrate the procedures and the absence of any significant toxicity effect. The others typically take about two months to complete their internal review before they can begin therapy. In each case, they will treat several animals with the objective of creating a detailed therapy procedure, which will be incorporated into product information for RadioGel™, known as a Label. The Company will then voluntarily ask the FDA to review this Label, as suggested by their guidance.
 
 These Labels will be used as part of our medical application to the FDA. A number of these animal cancers also occur in humans, so there is a direct benefit to our FDA applications when we get to that particular Indication for Use.
 
 The Labels and the animal experience will also be used to transfer the therapies to the private clinics and hospitals. Dr. Villalobos has agreed that her private clinic will be the first to implement the Company’s veterinary therapies, and the Company intends to assist Dr. Villalobos to obtain the required radioactive material handling license.
 
 After completing the first set of therapies, each university veterinary hospital will select additional Indications for Use.

  Competitors
  
 The Company competes in a market characterized by technological innovation, extensive research efforts, and significant competition.
 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological changes. A number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that our products target. We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of potentially competitive products or their possible effect on our sales. Certain potentially competitive products to our products are possibly in various stages of development. Also, there may be many ongoing studies with currently marketed products and other developmental products, which may yield new data that could adversely impact the use of our products in their current and potential future Indications for Use. The introduction of competitive products could significantly reduce our sales, which, in turn would adversely impact our financial and operating results.
  
 There are a wide variety of cancer treatments approved and marketed in the U.S. and globally. General categories of treatment include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. These products have a diverse set of success rates and side effects. The Company’s products, including RadioGel™, fall into the brachytherapy treatment category. There are a number of brachytherapy devices currently marketed in the U.S. and globally. The traditional iodine-125 (I-125) and palladium-103 (Pd-103) technologies for brachytherapy are well entrenched with powerful market players controlling the market. The industry-standard I-125-based therapy was developed by Oncura, which is a unit of General Electric Company. Additionally, C.R. Bard, a major industry player competes in the I-125 brachytherapy marketplace. These market competitors are also involved in the distribution of Pd-103 based products. Cs-131 brachytherapy products are sold by IsoRay. Several Y-90 therapies have been FDA approved including SIR-Spheres by Sirtex, TheraSphere by Biocompatibles UK and Zevalin by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals.
  
  Raw Materials
  
 The Company currently manufactures research quantities of brachytherapy products, including RadioGel™, or components of these products. The Company obtains supplies, hardware, handling equipment and packaging from several different U.S. and foreign suppliers. Some of the products the Company currently manufactures or intends to manufacture require purchasing raw materials from a limited number of suppliers, many of which are international suppliers.
 Customers
  
 The Company anticipates that potential customers for our potential brachytherapy products likely would include those institutions and individuals that currently purchase brachytherapy products or other oncology treatment products.
