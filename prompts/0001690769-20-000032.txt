Item 1. Business
Overview
Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. (“AMR”), together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“we”, “us”, “our” or “the Company”), is an independent exploration and production company focused on the development of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the eastern portion of the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma. We operate in two reportable business segments - Upstream and Midstream. Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”) conducts our Upstream activities and owns our proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in an area of the Anadarko Basin commonly referred to as the STACK. We generate upstream revenue principally by the production and sale of oil, gas and NGLs. Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“KFM”) conducts our Midstream operations. KFM has a gas and oil gathering network, a cryogenic gas processing plant with offtake capacity, field compression facilities and a produced water disposal system in the Anadarko Basin that generates revenue primarily through long-term, fee-based contracts.  Our principal offices are at 15021 Katy Freeway, Suite 400, Houston, Texas 77094 and our main phone number is (281) 530-0991.
We were originally incorporated in Delaware in November 2016 as a special purpose acquisition company under the name Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II. On March 29, 2017, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”). Proceeds from the IPO and a private sale of warrants were placed in a trust account and were used on February 9, 2018, to acquire the interests in Alta Mesa, Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC (“Alta Mesa GP”) and KFM through a newly formed subsidiary, SRII Opco, LP (“SRII Opco”) in a transaction referred to as the “Business Combination” at which time we changed our name from “Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II” to “Alta Mesa Resources, Inc.”. 
On September 11, 2019, AMR, Alta Mesa and all of its subsidiaries (the “AMH Debtors” and together with AMR, the “Initial Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (“Initial Bankruptcy Petitions”) for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (“Bankruptcy Code”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (“Bankruptcy Court”).
On January 12, 2020, KFM and all of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “KFM Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (“ KFM Bankruptcy Petitions”) for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. On January 13, 2020, SRII Opco GP, LLC and SRII Opco (collectively, the “SRII Debtors” and, together with the KFM Debtors, the “Additional Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (“SRII Bankruptcy Petitions and, together with the KFM Bankruptcy Petitions, the “Additional Bankruptcy Petitions”) for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. The Additional Debtors’ Chapter 11 cases are being jointly administered with the Initial Debtors’ Chapter 11 cases.
The Initial and Additional Debtors operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.
On December 31, 2019, the Initial Debtors entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (as amended and restated in January 2020, the “AMH PSA”) with BCE-Mach III LLC (the “Buyer”) pursuant to which the AMH Debtors agreed to sell to the Buyer substantially all of our upstream assets for an unadjusted purchase price of $232.0 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments (such transaction, the “AMH Sale Transaction”). On December 31, 2019, the KFM Debtors entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (as amended and restated in January 2020, the “KFM PSA” and, together with the AMH PSA, the “PSAs”) with the Buyer pursuant to which the KFM Debtors agreed to sell to the Buyer substantially all of our midstream assets for an unadjusted purchase price of $88.0 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments (such transaction, the “KFM Sale Transaction” and, together with the AMH Sale Transaction, the “Sale Transactions”). 
Index to Financial Statements

The Sale Transactions are expected to close no later than mid-April 2020, after which we will no longer own any operating assets. Following the expected sale, we intend to provide certain transition services to the Buyer for a limited period of time and expect to wind down our remaining business during the first half of 2020, which will result in the dissolution of AMR and its subsidiaries.
In March 2020, AMR, the AMH Debtors and the SRII Debtors expect to file a Chapter 11 plan (collectively, the “AMR Plan”). The AMR Plan will generally provide for the distribution of the proceeds of the AMH Sale Transaction to AMH’s creditors and transfer any remaining assets of the Initial Debtors and SRII Opco Debtors into a liquidating trust to administer and monetize such assets and to reconcile creditor claims against such debtors for the benefit of their respective creditors. Pursuant to the AMR Plan, all outstanding shares of class A common stock and class C common stock in the Company are expected to be canceled. 
The AMR Plan will be subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the Initial Debtors and the SRII Debtors are expected to solicit votes on the AMR Plan from certain of their creditors entitled to vote thereon pursuant to the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. We expect the Bankruptcy Court to hold a hearing to consider confirmation of the AMR Plan in April 2020. To the extent that the AMR Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, AMR expects the AMR Plan to become effective and be consummated shortly thereafter.
In March 2020, the KFM Debtors filed a Chapter 11 plan (the “KFM Plan”). The KFM Plan will generally provide for the (i) distribution of the proceeds of the KFM Sale Transaction to creditors, (ii) liquidation of any remaining assets of the KFM Debtors, and (iii) orderly wind-down of the KFM Debtors’ estates. Under the KFM Plan, the KFM Debtors will appoint a plan administrator who will, among other things, oversee the wind-down of the KFM Debtors and implement all provisions of the KFM Plan, including controlling and effectuating claims reconciliation. 
The KFM Plan is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the KFM Debtors are expected to solicit votes on the KFM Plan from certain of the KFM Debtors’ creditors pursuant to the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. We expect the Bankruptcy Court to hold a hearing to consider confirmation of the KFM Plan in April 2020. To the extent that the KFM Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, KFM expects the KFM Plan to become effective and be consummated shortly thereafter.
Our Class A Common Stock and public warrants to purchase Class A Common Stock, sold as part of the shares issued in the IPO, were initially traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”), but due to our failure to continue to meet the NASDAQ’s listing requirements, trading in our stock and public warrants was suspended in September 2019, and are now traded over the counter on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbols “AMRQQ” and “AMRWQ”, respectively. In February 2020, we filed forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission to deregister our Class A Common Stock and warrants under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) and suspend our reporting obligations under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we do not anticipate filing any additional current, quarterly or annual reports with the SEC.
Going Concern
AMR’s only significant asset is its ownership of a partnership interest in SRII Opco. As such, we have no meaningful cash available to meet our obligations apart from cash held by our subsidiaries. As a result of the bankruptcy filings by us and all of our subsidiaries, as described above, cash held by Alta Mesa and KFM can only be used to satisfy their obligations to the extent authorized by the Bankruptcy Code or by order of the Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy filings by the Initial Debtors and the Additional Debtors (collectively, “the Debtors”) triggered defaults in the Alta Mesa RBL, the 2024 Notes and the KFM Credit Facility, limiting our future borrowing ability and making our outstanding obligations immediately due and payable, although the creditors are currently stayed from taking any actions as a result of such defaults. The Debtors are also subject to limitations imposed under Bankruptcy Court approved cash collateral orders requiring us to (i) adhere to an approved budget with an agreed-upon variance and (ii) meet certain milestones.
We expect to sell substantially all of our assets no later than mid-April 2020. Following the expected sale, we intend to provide certain transition services to the Buyer for a limited period of time and expect to wind down our remaining business during the first half of 2020, which will result in the dissolution of AMR and its subsidiaries.
Index to Financial Statements

These factors, including historic recurring operating losses, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Organizational Structure 
The following diagram illustrates our ownership structure as of December 31, 2019.
Business Combination
As described further in Item 8 of this Annual Report, the Business Combination was consummated on February 9, 2018, that resulted in our acquisition of interests in Alta Mesa, Alta Mesa GP and KFM through a newly formed subsidiary, SRII Opco. Prior to the Business Combination, Alta Mesa was controlled by High Mesa, Inc. (“HMI”).
Immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, Alta Mesa distributed its non-STACK oil and gas assets and liabilities to High Mesa Holdings, LP (“High Mesa”), such that Alta Mesa’s only remaining oil and gas assets and liabilities were located in the STACK. As described elsewhere, High Mesa owes us a substantial sum for amounts arising before and after the Business Combination, and it had indemnified us for liabilities arising from non-STACK oil and gas assets. We believe there is substantial doubt about its ability to make payment and honor its indemnification given HMI’s filing for bankruptcy protection in January 2020. Information related to Alta Mesa’s non-STACK oil and gas assets and liabilities that were sold or distributed is disclosed as discontinued operations in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Pursuant to the Business Combination, we recorded the acquired assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values and pushed those values down to the financial records of our respective subsidiaries. This resulted in our financial presentation being separated into two distinct periods - the period before the Business Combination on February 9, 2018 (“Predecessor”) and the period after the Business Combination (“Successor”). 
Index to Financial Statements

Principal Products, Markets and Customers
Our Upstream segment sells our production of oil, natural gas and NGLs to customers generally at prevailing spot prices in effect at the time of the sale. Our Midstream segment derives its revenue from fees assessed for gathering and processing natural gas, gathering and transporting oil, the sale of processed residue gas and NGLs and produced water gathering and disposal services. Natural gas is processed on behalf of the producer and the resulting gas, condensate and NGLs are sold at market prices. We remit to the producer an agreed-upon price from the resulting sales, which is treated as product expense. Collateral or other security is generally not required with regard to our trade receivables. 
During most of the first quarter of 2019 and throughout 2018, ARM Energy Management, LLC (“ARM”) marketed our oil, gas and NGLs for a marketing fee that was deducted from sales proceeds collected by ARM from purchasers. The sales were generally made under short-term contracts with month-to-month pricing based on published regional indices, adjusted for transportation, location and quality.  In March 2019, in preparation for handling oil and NGL marketing responsibilities internally, we began receiving payments for the sale of oil and NGLs directly from purchasers and separately paying the marketing fee owed to ARM.  In June 2019, we terminated our oil and NGL marketing agreement with ARM and began marketing such products internally. 
For 2019, ARM marketed $123.0 million, or 24.6% of our total operating revenue for the period. 
Other than our natural gas marketing agreement with ARM, we had one customer, Phillips 66, that accounted for $202.6 million, or 40.5% of our total operating revenue for 2019. 
Seasonality
Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and gas. During the winter, natural gas demand for heating by residential and commercial consumers generally increases whereas high summer temperatures can result in an increase in demand from the power sector. Natural gas in storage typically increases from April through October. Crude oil markets tend to be stronger in the fourth quarter when demand for heating oil is impacted by colder weather and inventory build. Hurricanes and other severe weather (particularly along the Gulf Coast) can also impact supplies by causing disruptions in the level of oil and gas production. Due to these fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis.
Competition
We compete with other companies in all areas of our operations, including, in the past, the acquisition of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. Our competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies and independent oil and gas companies. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially greater resources and better credit than us and have been engaged in the oil and gas business for a longer period of time than we have. Our filings for bankruptcy protection and restrictions placed on our spending by the Bankruptcy Court have also put us at a competitive disadvantage. This may allow our competitors to have an advantage over us with respect to:

• | maintaining production levels on existing oil and gas properties;


• | evaluations of properties;


• | utilization of midstream assets; and


• | absorption of price changes and the costs and implementation of evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations.

In the past, the oil and gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe, materials (including drilling and completion fluids) and personnel. We are unable to predict when, or if, such future shortages will occur or their impact on our operations.
Regulatory Environment
Our Upstream and Midstream operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. Among other things, these laws and regulations may:
Index to Financial Statements


• | require various permits before drilling and other regulated activities commence;


• | require installation of pollution control equipment and place other conditions on our operations;


• | place restrictions on the use of materials for our operations and upon the disposal of by-products from our operations;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or used for our operations;


• | limit our operations on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;


• | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, including site restoration, pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells; and


• | impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection.

These laws, rules and regulations often impose difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in remedial or corrective action obligations. 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. As part of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes that may be deemed as hazardous wastes by regulatory authorities. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with our operations, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that regulations could change and cause wastes now classified as non-hazardous to be classified as hazardous wastes. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability on classes of persons considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances and other classes of materials. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for damages without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct. These classes of persons, referred to as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”), include the current and past owners or operators of a site where the hazardous substance release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the costs of such action. Many states have adopted comparable statutes. 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state and federal waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.
Safe Drinking Water Act
Our underground injection operations are regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and analogous state and local laws and regulations. The UIC program includes administrative requirements for produced water disposal and prohibits migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require permits to operate underground injection wells. Although we monitor the injection process of our wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of 
Index to Financial Statements

liability by third-parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property and personal injuries. A change in UIC disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced waters and other substances, which could affect our business.
Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near produced water disposal wells, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have contributed to increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such disposal wells. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma issued new rules for injection wells in 2014 that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, has developed and implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations.
National Environmental Policy Act
Our operations on federal lands may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), which requires federal agencies, including the EPA, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. As part of such evaluations, an agency will conduct an environmental assessment that assesses the potential impacts of a proposed project and may require the preparation of a detailed environmental impact statement for public review and comment. Our current and future operations on federal lands will be subject to NEPA, which could delay or impose additional conditions and costs on us. Moreover, this process could involve protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may impact our operations.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes enacted to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, comparable state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials attendant to our operations to our employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
Our processing plant operations are also subject to standards designed to ensure the safety of our processes, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Process Safety Management standard, which is designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. The Process Safety Management standard imposes requirements on regulated entities related to managing these hazards. These requirements include conducting process hazard analyses for processes involving highly hazardous chemicals, developing detailed written operating procedures, including procedures for managing change, and evaluating the mechanical integrity of critical equipment. We conduct periodic audits of Process Safety Management systems at each of our locations subject to this standard.
Hydraulic Fracturing
We perform hydraulic fracturing in horizontally drilled wells. Currently, most of our hydraulic fracturing activities are regulated at the state level, given that the EPA only has limited authority to regulate fracturing activities. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority or pursued investigations over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” including water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater into surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.
Clean Air Act
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations that restrict the emission of air pollutants. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approval for the construction or modification of certain facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, comply with stringent air permitting requirements and also utilize equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining such permits could delay our operations.

Climate Change Regulations and Legislation
Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at all levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.
At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. The EPA has, however, adopted regulations that, among other things, establish Potential for Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already potential sources of significant pollutant emissions. Sources subject to these permitting requirements must meet “best available control technology” standards for those GHG emissions. Additionally, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG emission sources in the United States, including, among others, onshore and offshore oil and gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which include certain of our operations.
Federal agencies also directly regulate emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and gas operations. In August 2016, the EPA issued a final New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) rule, known as Subpart OOOOa, which requires certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and gas sector to reduce methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards expanded the previously issued NSPS published by the EPA in 2012, and known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices. However, in August 2019, the EPA proposed two options for further rescinding the Subpart OOOOa standards. Under the EPA’s preferred alternative, the agency would rescind the methane limits for new, reconstructed and modified oil and natural gas production sources while leaving in place the general emission limits for volatile organic compounds, and relieve the EPA of its obligation to develop guidelines for methane emissions from existing sources. In addition, the proposal would remove from the oil and natural gas category the natural gas transmission and storage segment. The other proposed alternative would rescind the methane requirements of the Subpart OOOOa standards applicable to all oil and natural gas sources, without removing any sources from that source category (and still requiring control of volatile organic compounds in general). Future implementation of this rule is uncertain at this time. 
Other Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry
Our operations are also subject to various other types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulations include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate may also regulate:

• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the timing of conducting our activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;


• | the rates of production;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties where we operate;


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells;


• | interactions with surface owners and other third parties; and


• | abandonment of pipelines and midstream facilities.

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and gas properties. We rely upon the Oklahoma “forced pooling” process to facilitate working interest owners’ participation in our operations.  Under this process, if a party proposes to drill the initial well to a particular formation in a specific drilling and spacing unit but cannot obtain the agreement of all other oil and gas interest holders and other leaseholders within the unit as to how the unit should be developed, the party may initiate “forced pooling”. Under current regulations, drilling and spacing units for our targeted horizons are based on a maximum of four to eight horizontal wells, depending on the formation, on a 640-acre section. In a forced pooling action, the proposed operator files an application for a pooling order with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) and names all other persons with the right to drill the unit as respondents. The proposed operator is required to demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to bargain with all of the respondents prior to filing its application. The fair value of the mineral interests in the unit is determined in an administrative proceeding by reference to market transactions involving nearby oil and gas rights, including nearby mineral lease costs. 
Assuming the application for a forced pooling order is granted, the respondents then have 20 days to elect either to participate in the proposed well or accept fair value for their interest, usually in the form of a cash payment, an overriding royalty, or some 
Index to Financial Statements

combination, based on the fair value established and approved through the administrative hearing. The pooling order typically addresses the time frame for drilling the well and provides for the manner in which future wells within the unit may be drilled. The applicant for the pooling order is ordinarily designated as the operator of the wells subject to the pooling order. 
The availability of forced pooling normally means that it is difficult for a small number of owners to block or delay the drilling of a particular well proposed by another interest holder. Oil and gas companies in Oklahoma generally attempt to lease as much of the mineral interests in a particular area as are readily available at acceptable rates, and then use the forced pooling process to proceed with the desired development of the well. In this manner, we have the ability to expand into and develop areas near our existing acreage even if we are unable to lease all of the mineral interests in those areas. 
The gross production tax, or severance tax, is a value-based tax levied at a basic rate of 7% upon the production of oil and gas in Oklahoma. As an economic incentive to develop its resources, Oklahoma has historically offered a “tax holiday” with rates ranging from 1% for 48 months to 2% for 36 months for production from horizontal wells. Through June 2018, Oklahoma imposed a tax of 2% of gross production for the first 36 months of production and then at 7% thereafter on wells drilled after July 1, 2015. Effective July 2018, the 2% tax rate was increased to 5% for wells drilled after July 1, 2015 that were still within their first 36 months of production. For the period beyond 36 months, the tax rate remains at 7% for the remaining productive life of each well. All wells drilled after July 1, 2018 are taxed at 5% of gross production for the first 36 months of production and then at 7% thereafter. In addition, a longstanding excise tax of 0.095% continues to be levied.
Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations covering these procedures. Some state agencies and municipalities have binding requirements related thereto.
Regulation of Natural Gas Sales and Transportation
The rates, terms and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of oil and natural gas liquids by pipelines are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”), as common carriers, under the Interstate Commerce Act. The FERC has implemented a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate oil and natural gas liquids pipelines to fulfill the requirements of Title XVIII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 comprised of an indexing system to establish ceilings on interstate oil and natural gas liquids pipeline rates. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors.
The pipelines used to gather and transport natural gas being produced by us are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, as reauthorized and amended (“Pipeline Safety Act”), and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011. The DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has established a risk-based approach to determine which gathering pipelines are subject to regulation and what safety standards regulated gathering pipelines must meet. In March 2016, the PHMSA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to revise the Pipeline Safety Regulations applicable to the safety of onshore gas transmission and gathering pipelines, including both high consequence areas (“HCAs”) and non-HCAs. In October 2019, PHMSA submitted three major rules to the Federal Register, including rules focused on: the safety of gas transmission pipelines (the first of three parts of the so-called gas Mega Rule), the safety of hazardous liquid pipelines, and enhanced emergency order procedures. The gas transmission rule requires operators of gas transmission pipelines constructed before 1970 to determine the material strength of their lines by reconfirming the maximum allowable operating pressure. In addition, the rule updates reporting and records retention standards for gas transmission pipelines. PHMSA is expected to issue the second and third parts of the gas Mega Rule in the near future. The safety and hazardous liquid pipelines rule would extend leak detection requirements to all non-gathering hazardous liquid pipelines and require operators to inspect affected pipelines following extreme weather events or natural disasters to address any resulting damage. Finally, the enhanced emergency procedures rule focuses on increased emergency safety measures. In particular, this rule increases the authority of PHMSA to issue an emergency order that addresses unsafe conditions or hazards that pose an imminent threat to pipeline safety.
Any transportation of our crude oil, natural gas liquids and purity components (ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline) by rail is also subject to regulation by the DOT’s PHMSA, and the DOT’s Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) 
Index to Financial Statements

under the Hazardous Materials Regulations at 49 CFR Parts 171-180, including Emergency Orders by the FRA and new regulations being proposed by the PHMSA, arising due to the consequences of train accidents and the increase in the rail transportation of flammable liquids. In October 2015, the PHMSA issued proposed new safety regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines, including a requirement that all hazardous liquid pipelines have a system for detecting leaks and establish a timeline for inspections of affected pipelines following extreme weather events or natural disasters.
Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. We believe that our Midstream assets meet the tests the FERC has used to determine exemption from its jurisdiction. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various occupational safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future. Our natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject to more stringent application of state or federal regulation of rates and services.
Other
The oil and gas industry is also subject to other federal, state and local regulations and laws relating to resource conservation and employment standards.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 151 full-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. 
Insurance
We maintain customary insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed such as general liability (includes sudden and accidental pollution), physical damage to our assets, control of wells, auto liability, worker’s compensation and employer’s liability.
We regularly execute master services contracts with our third-party vendors, suppliers and contractors in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of their employees and contractors. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify them against claims made by our other vendors, suppliers, contractors and employees. Additionally, each party is generally responsible for damage to its own property. 
Available Information
We disseminate information about the Company through required filings we make with the SEC and, at our discretion, on our website at www.altamesa.net.
