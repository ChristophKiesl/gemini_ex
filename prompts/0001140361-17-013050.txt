ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Our Company
 
We are an ingredient company serving food, animal nutrition and specialty markets focused on value-added processing and marketing of healthy, natural and nutrient dense products derived from raw rice bran, an underutilized by-product of the rice milling industry.
 
We apply our proprietary and patented technologies and intellectual properties to convert raw rice bran into numerous high value products including:
 
 
· | stabilized rice bran or SRB,
--+-----------------------------


· | rice bran oil or RBO,
--+----------------------


· | defatted rice bran or DRB, and
--+-------------------------------


· | derivative products including:
--+-------------------------------


o | RiBalance, a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing of SRB;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RiSolubles, a highly nutritious, carbohydrate and lipid rich fraction of RiBalance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RiFiber, a protein and fiber rich insoluble derivative of RiBalance; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | our family of ProRyza products, which includes derivatives composed of protein and protein/fiber blends.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We have two reportable operating segments in 2016: (i) USA, which manufactures and distributes SRB (for food and animal nutrition customers) and derivative products as well as contract manufacturing of functional food products with an emphasis on utilization of our proprietary and patented functional food ingredients; and (ii) Brazil, which extracts crude RBO from raw rice bran and produces DRB as a co-product.  RBO is then further processed into degummed, neutralized and/or fully refined rice bran oil for sale internationally and in Brazil.  DRB is sold as feed for horses, cows, swine, sheep and poultry and a number of food and animal nutrition products.  We incur corporate and other expenses not directly attributable to operating segments. These include costs related to our corporate staff, general and administrative expenses including public company expenses, intellectual property, professional fees, and other expenses.  No Corporate allocations, including interest, are made to the operating segments.
 
Our target markets are organic and natural food, functional food, supplement and animal nutrition manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, both domestically and internationally.
 
The combined operations of our USA and Brazil segments encompass our approach to processing raw rice bran into various high quality, value-added constituents and finished products.  Over the past decade, we have developed and optimized our proprietary processes to support the production of healthy, natural and non-genetically modified ingredients that are free of all major allergens for use in meats, baked goods, cereals, coatings, health foods, nutritional supplements, nutraceuticals and high-end animal nutrition and animal health products.
 
We incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1998.  From July 2003 until October 2012, our corporate name was “NutraCea.”  At that time we changed our name to RiceBran Technologies.  As of December 31, 2016, our corporate headquarters are located in Scottsdale, Arizona.  We intend to relocate our corporate headquarters to California during 2017.  Over the past several years, we have increased our geographic presence and expanded our capabilities:
 
 
· | 2016 – Entered into a strategic supply partnership with the Thailand-based Narula Group of companies to add organic jasmine rice bran and organic red rice bran, as well as other organic products, to our portfolio of products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 2014 – Acquired H&N Distribution Inc., an Irving, Texas based company now operating as Healthy Natural, Inc. (“HN”) which has a formulating, blending and co-packaging facility in Irving, Texas, where we manufacture blended and/or packaged functional food products for the nutrition and functional food markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 2008 – Through our subsidiary Nutra S.A. LLC (“Nutra SA”), we initially acquired 100% ownership of Industria Riograndens De Oleos Vegetais Ltda. (“Irgovel”), our rice bran oil refining plant in Pelotas, Brazil. In 2011, we sold a minority interest in Nutra SA to AF Bran Holdings-NL LLC and AF Bran Holding LLC (the “Investors”).

USA Segment
 
The USA segment produces SRB inside three locations: two leased raw rice bran stabilization facilities located within supplier-owned rice mills in Arbuckle and West Sacramento, California; and one owned rice bran stabilization facility in Mermentau, Louisiana.  At our Dillon, Montana facility, the USA segment produces our process patented Stage II products including: RiSolubles, a highly nutritious, carbohydrate and lipid rich fraction of SRB; RiFiber, a fiber rich derivative of SRB; RiBalance, a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing SRB, and our ProRyza family of products including, protein- and protein/fiber-based products.  “Stage II” refers to the products produced using our patented process technology run at our Dillon, Montana facility.  The manufacturing facilities included in our USA segment have proprietary processing equipment and process patented technology for the stabilization and further processing of rice bran into finished products.
 
At our HN facility in Irving Texas, we formulate, blend and package finished products on a customized basis for our customers.  We also lease a facility in West Sacramento, California that houses a laboratory, warehouse and facility for assembling RBT proprietary extruders for stabilizing raw rice bran.  In 2016, approximately 84% of USA segment revenue is from sales of food ingredient products and the remainder was from sales of animal nutrition products.
 
Brazil Segment
 
The Brazil segment consists of the consolidated operations of Nutra SA, whose only operating subsidiary is Irgovel, located in Pelotas, Brazil.  Irgovel manufactures RBO and DRB products for both the food ingredient and animal nutrition markets in Brazil and internationally.  In refining RBO to an edible grade, several co-products are obtained.  One such product is distilled fatty acids, a valuable raw material for the detergent industry.  Irgovel also produces rice lecithin, which has application in food ingredient products, animal nutrition and industrial applications.  DRB is sold in bulk in the Brazilian market and internationally as an animal nutrition ingredient, and is sold as a raw material for further processing into food ingredient products.  In 2016, approximately 58% of Brazil segment product revenue was from sales of RBO products and the remainder was from sales of DRB products.
 
Our Irgovel subsidiary is comprised of several facilities on approximately 19 acres in Pelotas, Brazil.  These facilities include a plant for extraction of RBO from raw rice bran, RBO refining processes, compounded animal nutrition manufacturing, consumer RBO bottling, distilled fatty acid manufacture, lecithin manufacture, and support systems for the plant, including steam generation, maintenance, administrative offices and a quality assurance laboratory.
 
Our Products
 
Consistent with our mission to convert feed to food, our greatest opportunities are in the functional food, nutraceutical and food ingredient markets.
 
Premium natural, organic and functional ingredient manufacturers are in high demand and we are strategically positioned to take advantage of this growing and sustainable market opportunity as discussed below in “Our Growth Strategy”.
 
Our ingredient products are primarily sold to consumer nutrition and healthcare companies, nutritional supplement retailers and direct sales companies.  In August 2013, we entered into a multi-year agreement to sell certain of our Stage II products to a rapidly growing direct marketing company.  Pursuant to that agreement, that company is obligated to purchase a minimum of $7.7 million in products during the term of the agreement which expired in February 2017.  We will seek additional long-term supply agreements with similar companies in the future.
 
Food and Functional Food Ingredients
 
Our SRB, DRB, RBO and derivatives are nutritional, functional and beneficial food products that contain a unique combination of oil, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fibers and antioxidants that enhance the nutritional value of popular consumer products.  Foods that are ideally suited for the addition of our SRB and DRB to their products include processed meats, cereals, snacks, beverages, baked goods, breading and batters.  The inclusion of DRB in breading and batters can result in a reduction in oil uptake, higher moisture retention, improved nutritional profiles, and reduced costs.
 
In 2008, we received U. S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Food Safety and Inspection Service (“FSIS”) approval to market rice bran as an ingredient to be used as a filler in comminuted meat products, such as meat and poultry sausages that contain binders, nugget-shaped patties, meatballs, meatloaf and meat and poultry patties.  Our products replace functional ingredients like soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, modified food starch, pea protein and mustard flour at a significantly reduced cost.  With strong application benefits such as reduced cost per unit, increased product yield and reduced purge, we believe our SRB has a significant market opportunity in the comminuted meat market both inside and outside of the United States.

Animal Nutrition
 
Our SRB and DRB products are marketed as feed ingredients in the United States and international animal nutrition markets, and we will continue to pursue high margin sales opportunities in those markets.  SRB and DRB are used as equine feed ingredients and have been shown to provide health benefits.  Show and performance horses represent the premium end of the equine market and are a key target for our animal nutrition products.  In our Brazil segment, we also sell DRB as an ingredient for inclusion in a variety of feed formulations targeted to animal species such as horses, beef cattle, dairy cows, pigs, sheep and poultry.
About Rice Bran
 
Rice is the staple food for over half of the world’s population and is the staple food source for several of the world’s most populous countries.  Asia accounts for roughly 90% of global rice production and China is the world’s number one rice producer.  Globally, Brazil and the United States rank 9th and 11th, respectively, in production of rice, with each country producing approximately 2% of the global total.
 
When harvested from the field, individual rice kernels are stored in common receiving locations such as farm silos for future delivery to grain dryers or area rice mills.  At this stage, large quantities of individual rice kernels are collectively called “paddy rice,” or “rough” rice.  In this form, the rice kernel is fully enveloped by the rice hull, which serves as a protective cover, shielding the inner rice kernel from damage.
 
After storage and drying, if necessary, paddy rice is cleaned of foreign material (scalping, de-stoning and aspiration) just before it enters the first stage of milling, or paddy husking.  In the paddy husker, the hull is removed from rough rice by differential speed rubber rollers.  Loosened hulls are carried off by aspiration.  After husking, a paddy separator uses a reciprocating motion to separate normal brown rice kernels (caryopsis) from unhusked kernels which are returned to the paddy husker.
 
In the second stage of milling, the outer brown layers of bran are removed from the inner white starch endosperm by an abrasive or frictional milling process which produces a milled, white rice kernel.  After milling, white rice is typically sorted by size to remove broken pieces of rice kernels from whole kernels, as well as color sorting to remove discolored kernels.  Additional stages may be required (per customer specifications) to polish the white rice to a smooth surface.
 
Raw rice bran collected from the milling process is composed of rice germ and several sub-layers (pericarp, testa, nucellus and aleurone) surrounding the white starchy endosperm.  Commercial rice bran makes up approximately 10% of rough rice by weight.  Rice germ, an especially nutrient rich material, makes up approximately 10% of commercial rice bran by weight.
 
As brown rice is milled into white rice, the oils present in raw rice bran come into contact with native lipase enzymes that are naturally present in the rice kernel.  These lipase enzymes initiate a rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of the oil, converting oils (triglycerides) into monoglycerides, diglycerides and free fatty acids (“FFA”).  As the FFA content builds in raw rice bran, the bran becomes unpalatable and off flavors (rancidity) develop.  If left unchecked, enzymatic degradation at normal room temperatures can increase the FFA levels to 5-8% within 24 hours and can continue at a rate of approximately 4-5% per day thereafter.  Enzymatic degradation is the most serious form of degradation of raw rice bran.  Rice bran stabilization is the process of carefully deactivating native enzymes to prevent the increase of FFA otherwise caused by lipase enzyme activity.  Proper stabilization is critical in the preservation of the nutritional value of the bran, an important nutrient source that is largely used as animal feed or otherwise wasted.
 
Historically there have been a number of attempts to develop rice bran stabilization techniques, including the use of chemicals, microwave heating or variations of existing extrusion technology.  Many of these approaches have had limited success in part because they have produced rice bran with limited shelf life or with significant degradation of nutrients.
 
Our Technologies
 
Our Proprietary Rice Bran Stabilization Technology
 
Our stabilization process uses proprietary innovations to create a combination of temperature, pressure and other conditions necessary to thoroughly deactivate enzymes without significantly damaging the structure or nutrient content of raw rice bran.  This means that higher value compounds in bran, such as oils, proteins and phytonutrients are left undamaged and are available for utilization.  Our process does not use chemicals to stabilize raw rice bran.

 Index

Our stabilizers are designed to be installed adjacent to, on the premises of or in near proximity to any conventional rice mill so that freshly milled raw rice bran can be quickly delivered to our proprietary stabilizers.  Process logic controllers maintain exact process conditions within the prescribed pressure/temperature regime.  In case of power failure or interruption of the flow of fresh bran into the system, the electronic control system is designed to purge the equipment of materials in process and resume production only after proper operating conditions are re-established.
 
SRB leaving our system is then discharged onto cooling units specifically designed to control air pressure and humidity.  Cooled SRB can be loaded into bulk hopper trucks for large volume customers or sent by pneumatic conveyor to a bagging unit for packaging into 50 pound bags or 2,000 pound sacks.
 
Each stabilization module can process approximately 2,000 pounds of bran per hour and has a capacity of over 7,200 tons per year.  Stabilization production capacity can be doubled, tripled or further multiplied by installing additional units sharing a common conveyor and stage system, which we believe can handle the output of the world’s largest rice mills.  We have also developed and tested a smaller production unit, with a maximum production capacity of 840 tons per year, for installation in countries or locations where rice mills are substantially smaller than those in the United States.
 
Additional patented and proprietary processes involve enzyme treatment of SRB or DRB to produce fractions enriched in one or more macronutrients, including proteins, fibers, lipids and micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals and phytosterols, among others.  In these processes SRB or DRB, in an aqueous slurry, is treated with one or more enzymes, centrifugally separated and the fractions dried on drum driers, spray driers or other drying systems.
 
Our Stabilization Process
 
Rice bran is free of all major allergens and is a valuable source of protein with a balanced amino acid profile for food ingredient products and is rich in healthy oil, vitamins, antioxidants, dietary fiber and other nutrients.  The approximate composition and caloric content of our SRB is as follows:

Fat (oil) | 18-23% 
--------------------+--------------
Protein | 12-16% 
Total Dietary Fiber | 20-30% 
Moisture | 4-8% 
Ash | 6-14% 
Calories | 3.2 kcal/gram

 
Rice bran contains approximately 18-23% oil, which has a favorable fatty acid composition and excellent heat stability.  Rice bran oil contains essential fatty acids and a broad range of nutraceutical compounds that have been demonstrated to have therapeutic properties.
 
The process begins when raw rice bran is obtained from a number of rice mills and transported to a facility within which it is first stabilized via extrusion and then solvent-extracted to produce crude RBO and DRB.  Crude RBO is subsequently processed in a number of steps designed to sequentially capture constituents of value and to remove and discard impurities.  The final outcome of these steps is a highly refined, edible RBO that has superior flavor and functional properties.  In addition, the various co-products of crude RBO processing, distilled fatty acids for example, are refined and sold as products in their own right.  DRB is finely ground and packaged for use as a versatile food ingredient in many applications.  DRB may also be compounded with other ingredients such as a vegetable proteins, carbohydrates, vitamin premixes and minerals to produce an array of nutritionally targeted animal feeds for various species.  The DRB can also be further processed to extract and concentrate protein and dietary fiber.  Our process and related technologies are being continuously improved and optimized as we examine the technical and commercial feasibility of producing additional products derived from both RBO and DRB.
 
DRB contains many of the same nutritional and functional benefits as SRB, except that the oil has been removed.  This is important for several ingredient applications where SRB’s oil content could present food formulation challenges.  By removing oil from SRB, nutritionists have greater options to formulate DRB into breakfast bars, low-calorie foods, low-fat baking applications and batter and breading for frying applications.  Additionally, DRB is ideally suited for downstream enzymatic processing, transforming DRB into an ideal feedstock for protein and fiber concentrates.
 
RBO as extracted from stabilized rice bran can be utilized in a variety of edible and industrial oil applications.  With proper processing, RBO becomes high quality cooking oil possessing beneficial high temperature frying characteristics.  RBO has a unique fatty acid content that imparts improved oxidative stability as compared to other vegetable oils such as soy or cottonseed giving it advantages when used in food applications.  The RBO extraction process utilized at our Brazilian facility uses a conventional solvent extraction process to separate oil from raw bran, resulting in crude RBO available for sale to industrial markets or other processors.  Additional refining processes done in Brazil can involve degumming, neutralization, bleaching, de-waxing and deodorizing.

Intellectual Property
 
We hold eight U.S. patents relating to the production or use of rice bran and rice bran derivatives.  In addition to the issued U.S. patents, we have been issued fourteen foreign patents covering the subject areas.  We intend to apply for additional patents in the future as new products, treatments and uses are developed.
 
Our stabilization and processing activities are an adaptation and refinement of standard food processing technology applied to rice bran.  We have chosen to treat certain of our methods and processes as a trade secret and not to pursue process or process equipment patents on the original processes.  However, as we develop improvements we intend to periodically review whether we should seek patent protection for them.  We believe that certain unique products, and their biological effects, resulting from our SRB may be patentable in the future.  We also hold a number of U.S. registered trademarks and trade names and have applied for additional marks.
 
From 2011 to March 2013, we engaged in a joint research project with DSM Innovation Center, a subsidiary of Royal DSM N.V., to develop methods for extracting and concentrating high quality vegetable protein from rice bran.  Combined spending on research and development related to that project totaled $3.0 million.  In March 2013, we announced the development of an improved fiber protein product and a separate water soluble rice bran protein product which have been commercialized under the ProRyza mark.  We will continue to support internal as well as external R&D efforts that improve on existing technologies or lead to the development of new technologies relating to rice bran processing and applications.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We experienced significant changes in the constitution of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and senior management team in 2016. During the summer of 2016, the Company was involved in a proxy contest with LF-RB Management (“LF-RB”).  LF-RB believed that Board and management changes were necessary to maximize shareholder value, which included the implementation of a turnaround and growth plan.  The proxy contest resulted in major changes to the Board, the appointment of Dr. Robert Smith, our COO at the time, as interim CEO, and the hiring of Michael Goose, a new products innovator with significant consumer packaged goods experience, as President of Sales and Marketing.  The new management team, working closely with the Board, developed a turnaround and growth plan to improve our financial condition, expand our markets and business, improve our profitability and maximize shareholder value. The following company actions represent a summary of our growth strategy:

1. | Establishment of a consolidation plan for the USA Segment that will improve operational efficiencies and result in cost savings: We have developed a focused plan that provides clear market targets for driving revenue growth in food and animal nutrition ingredients and reflecting our focus on driving better returns on capital and for shareholders. The first phase of our strategic initiatives will be the streamlining of our operations through consolidation to better position RiceBran as a reliable world-class supplier of ingredients. We believe we can obtain significant cost reductions and improved efficiencies by consolidating our operations into fewer locations. We are actively engaged in locating a site in California, in the heart of rice growing territory where much of our bran supply is obtained. We are relocating our corporate office to Sacramento on April 1, 2017, and plan to secure and relocate most of our corporate operations in late 2017. Apart from being the heart of the rice growing region of California, the Sacramento Valley offers a number of benefits that will help us become the leader in our field while at the same time being more responsive to our customers and reducing the risk in bran supplies. These benefits include: i) proximity to major rice mills that we are in discussions with to secure additional bran; ii) proximity to our existing base of west-coast customers for both food and animal nutrition ingredients; iii) access to world-class scientists and technologies at University of California-Davis in areas of rice agriculture and processing, food and beverage innovation and animal nutrition. This agricultural and technology hub in the Sacramento Valley generates and supports a strong and well-prepared workforce that will benefit us as we grow our business. As we consolidate much of our management, operations, warehousing and distribution into a centralized location, we will realize significant cost savings and improved operational efficiencies. These changes will also support our continued commitment to achieving the highest standards of food quality and safety. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We will continue to operate in the mid-south region in Louisiana and further our discussions with mill operators in that region to secure additional supplies of bran.  This will help us to achieve continued growth in our animal nutrition business and enable us to prepare for supplying food grade rice bran ingredients from the mid-south to our midwest and east coast customers in the future.
 
Our plan will require some added investment, but much of this will be mitigated by significant cost reductions that we have already begun to implement, better operating leverage of new operations, improved efficiencies through consolidation of our operations, as well as capital realized from the divestiture of non-core assets and business activities. We may also explore opportunities for key industry participants to become strategic investors in the business. We will take every step possible to maximize company and investor returns by implementing plans that seek strong corporate returns on our investments.  In Brazil, we remain committed to our strategy of minimizing the financial impact of our Irgovel operations while exploring strategic alternatives.

2. | Marketing our rice bran ingredients to major food companies that are striving to meet the needs of today’s and tomorrow’s demanding consumer: The global and domestic markets are strong and rapidly expanding for minimally processed plant-based ingredients that provide dense and balanced nutrition in addition to evidence-based functionalities while also being free of all major allergens and being non-GMO. The regulatory requirements to add front-of-label warnings on food items and increasing demand from consumers for foods that list fewer and less processed ingredients is driving food companies to replace standard food ingredients with cleaner ingredients, such as stabilized rice bran. We anticipate further incorporation of our food ingredients by major consumer packaged goods food companies as more food companies adopt rice bran as a standard clean label food ingredient. This trend is not limited to food ingredients, as we are finding similar transition to clean ingredients among high-end animal nutrition companies.

Our Customers
 
Both our USA and Brazil segments use internal sales staff, outside independent sales representatives and third party distributors to market our portfolio of products to customers domestically and internationally.  In 2016, three customers accounted for 62% of USA segment revenues.  In our Brazil segment, three customers accounted for 32% of segment revenues.  In 2015, three customers accounted for 63% of USA segment revenues and three customers accounted for 40% of Brazil segment revenues.  We continue to focus efforts on diversification of our customer base in an attempt to mitigate the concentration of customers.
Our Strategic Alliances
 
In February 2016, we entered into an exclusive supply and cooperation agreement with a Thailand-based entity (“Youji”) granting us the exclusive worldwide, with certain exclusions, supply and distribution rights for their organic rice bran.  In addition, as part of the agreement we have agreed to lease two of our proprietary stabilization extruders to Youji for stabilization purposes at one of their rice mills.
 
In 2013, we entered into a series of agreements with various affiliates of Wilmar International Limited (collectively “Wilmar”).  In connection therewith, we sold a 50% membership interest in RBT PRO, LLC (“RBT PRO”) to Wilmar.  RBT PRO granted an exclusive, royalty free, perpetual sublicense of the license to use processes for deriving protein from rice bran to Wilmar for use throughout China and to us for use worldwide, excluding China.  Any royalty revenue derived from that same license would be revenue of RBT PRO.
 
We also entered into a cross license agreement with Wilmar, and under the agreements, we obtained the right to purchase 45% of the capital stock of any entity Wilmar establishes to develop new products relating to rice bran or its derivatives, as defined in the agreement, using the intellectual property licensed to Wilmar.  If we decline the right to purchase 45% of the capital stock of any such new entity, we have the option to purchase 25% of the entity within two years of the entity’s formation.  The exercise price for this option will equal 25% of the capital investment made in the entity, plus interest, as defined in the agreement.
 
Government Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to federal, foreign, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, workplace safety and accommodations for the disabled and our relationships with our employees are subject to regulations, including minimum wage requirements, anti-discrimination laws, overtime and working conditions and citizenship requirements.
 
In both our United States and foreign markets, we are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints.  Such laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States, and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions, including regulations pertaining to the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our products.  In addition, we are subject to regulations regarding product claims and advertising.
 
USA Segment
 
The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, primarily the Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the USDA.  Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are manufactured and sold, as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States, such as Brazil (discussed below), in which our products are manufactured and sold.  Among other matters, regulation by the FDA and FTC is concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product’s ability to provide health-related benefits.  Specifically, the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of food and food ingredients.  The FTC regulates the advertising of these products.

 Index

Federal agencies, primarily the FDA and the FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them, including initiating investigations, issuing warning letters and cease-and-desist orders, requiring corrective labeling or advertising, requiring consumer redress such as requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold, seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, imposing civil penalties or commencing criminal prosecution.  In addition, certain state agencies have similar authority.  These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food and food ingredient industries, including the imposition of civil penalties.
 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), enacted January 4, 2011, amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA’s authority over various aspects of food regulation.  The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines there is a reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of, or exposure to, the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.  One of the FSMA’s more significant changes is the requirement of hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls (“HARPC”) for all food facilities required to register with the FDA.
 
Any substance that is intentionally added to food is a food additive and is subject to premarket review and approval by the FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the use of the substance is otherwise excluded from the definition of a food additive.  When an additive is proposed for use in a meat, its safety, technical function and conditions of use must also be evaluated by the USDA.  Because the USDA retains jurisdiction over meat products and food ingredients intended for use in meats, the use of our SRB and DRB meat enhancers is regulated by this agency.  Both SRB and DRB have USDA approval for use in meat products.
 
Animal feed ingredients are regulated by the FDA at the federal level and by the individual states.  Our SRB is defined for animal use as heat stabilized rice bran for use as a feed ingredient.
 
Brazil Segment
 
The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (“MAPA”), one of the Federal administrative bodies, is the primary regulator of agricultural products in Brazil, and its main activity is the management of public policies to encourage agriculture, the promotion of agribusiness and the regulation and standardization of services related to the sector.  Amongst other activities, MAPA is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biological products and medicated feed additives for animal use.  MAPA is organized into departments, each one responsible for different sectors of the nation’s agribusiness.  Amongst these departments, the Secretary of Agricultural Defense (“SDA”) is responsible for implementing the actions of the State which aims at the prevention, control and eradication of animal diseases and plant pests.  The SDA also contributes to the formulation of the national agricultural policy by planning, regulating, coordinating and supervising the activities of agricultural defense throughout the country, being responsible for the coordination of the Department of Inspection of Livestock Products.  In order to fulfill its mission, the SDA provides central management and regulatory bodies as well as projections within the states for the implementation and coordination of those activities for which it is responsible.  Furthermore, ANVISA, a regulatory agency which operates in all those sectors related to products and services that affect the health of the population, and with expertise that covers both sanitary regulation and the economic regulation of the market, contributes to the enforcement of most of the regulations regarding processed food products, including vegetable oils, fats and vegetable creams.
Our Competition
 
There are a number of companies that have invested significant resources to develop technologies for stabilizing and further processing rice bran and who market rice bran products with varying levels of stabilization into multiple markets around the world.  We believe that we have best of breed technologies for stabilizing rice bran and, as such, have developed significant brand recognition in the animal feed and food ingredient product sectors both domestically and internationally.  Together with our decades of application technology know-how and patented processing methods, we believe that we have a first-to-market advantage over the competition with respect to our SRB products.
 
We are aware of several new producers of rice-based animal nutrition and food ingredient products in the United States, Europe and Asia.  We believe that our major nutritional supplement competitors include producers of isolated soy protein, wheat bran and oat bran, particularly in the functional food ingredients market segment.
 
We compete with other companies that offer products incorporating SRB as well as companies that offer other food ingredients and nutritional supplements.  We also face competition from companies providing products that use oat bran and wheat bran as nutritional supplements as well as for health and beauty aids.  Many consumers may consider such products to be a replacement for the products we manufacture and distribute.

 Index

We also compete in the world’s edible oil market.  Our competition for exports of rice bran oil resides primarily in Southeast Asia.  Our branded rice bran oil “Carreteiro” competes with other bottled oils such as soy, palm, canola, peanut and others in the Brazilian retail market.  In addition, our exported rice bran oil competes with those same oils from other grains, seeds and plants in markets around the world.
Our Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the USA and Corporate segments had 75 employees located in the United States and the Brazil segment had 152 employees.  Our employee count may change periodically.  From year to year we experience normal variable labor fluctuation at our production facilities.  We believe relations with our employees are good.  None of our U.S. based employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
