Item 1. Business
Overview
    PROS provides solutions that optimize the processes of selling and shopping in the digital economy. PROS solutions leverage artificial intelligence ("AI"), self-learning and automation to ensure that every transactional experience is fast, frictionless and personalized for every shopper, supporting both business-to-business ("B2B") and business-to-consumer ("B2C") companies across industry verticals. Companies can use our selling, pricing, revenue optimization and eCommerce solutions to assess their market environments in real time to deliver customized prices and offers. Our solutions enable buyers to move fluidly across our customers’ direct sales, partner, online, mobile and emerging channels with personalized experiences regardless of which channel buyers choose. Our decades of data science and AI expertise are infused into our solutions and are designed to reduce time and complexity through actionable intelligence. We provide standard configurations of our solutions based on the industries we serve and offer services to configure our solutions to meet the specific needs of each customer.
Our subscription-as-a-service ("SaaS") solutions are designed to achieve high levels of security, scalability, performance and availability. We believe our SaaS solutions provide an advantage over traditional enterprise software by allowing our customers to reduce their initial investment in third-party software, hardware and administration requirements, and also allow smaller customers or business units to cost-effectively leverage our enterprise class infrastructure, infrastructure management, security and other strategic services.
Before 2015, we primarily offered on-premises license solutions, for which our customers purchased the perpetual right to use our software within a specific license scope. These license customers generally also purchased software maintenance and support, which includes unspecified software updates and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period.
    More than half of our revenue in 2020 and 2019 was derived from our cloud solutions, and since 2017 we have sold over 90% of our solutions as SaaS offerings. We manage all updates and upgrades of software deployed on the PROS cloud on behalf of our customers, which enables us to deliver our latest product innovations to our customers in a more uniform way. We focus the vast majority of our product development efforts on our SaaS solutions, and our next-generation solutions have been built natively in the cloud.
Our Industry
    Real-time decision making is an important driver of business performance in the digital economy. Rapidly changing markets and buyer expectations make it increasingly harder for companies to compete and grow. In response to these pressures, we believe that market forces, including increasingly dynamic and complex business models, the explosion of eCommerce, and the exponential increase in the volume of enterprise and market data will accelerate the demand for software solutions that enable companies to dynamically price, configure and sell their products and services across an ever-increasing set of buyer channels with speed, precision and consistency. We believe the market for solutions that can power commerce using AI and machine learning is a large, growing market that spans most major industries.
Our Solutions
    Our cloud-based software solutions provide companies with AI-based predictive and prescriptive guidance on key business decisions that drive growth and profitability, including product mix optimization, price forecasting, price optimization, product configuration recommendations, new sales opportunity recommendations, cross-sell recommendations and proactive attrition detection. These insights are derived from machine learning data science based on historical customer transactions, external market inputs and other data. Our cloud solutions enable a consistent buyer experience across direct, partner and eCommerce channels to support digital selling. Our solutions help increase visibility, business agility and customer engagement by aligning sales and pricing strategy across go-to-market channels. As a result, our solutions make it easier for companies to recommend and configure the correct solution(s), set the right price and quickly get a quote into the hands of a buyer.
    Solutions for Selling Improvement
    PROS selling solutions are designed to improve sales productivity and accelerate deal velocity by automating common sales tasks. Utilizing a foundation of AI and machine learning algorithms, PROS selling solutions empower businesses to tailor every offer for every buyer, across all sales channels, leading to more personalized and engaging customer interactions:
•PROS Smart CPQ accelerates the sales process and provides a powerful, intuitive tool for sales teams and partners to respond to customer quotes within minutes. Leveraging state-of-the-art AI and machine learning algorithms, Smart CPQ enables users to find and tailor product recommendations, customize configurations, manage approvals, price just right and generate professional proposals to increase the probability of winning the sale on the first quote. Smart CPQ supports all selling scenarios including spot-order purchases, subscription orders and setup and maintenance of negotiated sales agreements. Businesses can also integrate Smart CPQ into their eCommerce portals, empowering end users to self-serve with confidence. We also offer a Sales Agreements edition which automates the quoting process when a longer-term agreement on product, price and terms is negotiated between buyer and seller, supporting increased collaboration and approvals that are required when actual order quantity is uncertain but can be estimated over the agreement term period.
•PROS Opportunity Detection increases sales effectiveness and productivity while accelerating quota attainment by uncovering sales opportunities in existing accounts for sales teams. By applying AI and machine learning techniques to historical transactional activity, Opportunity Detection surfaces new opportunities to help proactively increase account penetration with existing customers while preventing customer churn. Businesses can also integrate Opportunity Detection into their eCommerce portal, providing personalized product recommendations for every end user along their eCommerce journey.
Solutions for Pricing 
    PROS pricing solutions enable enterprises to optimize, personalize and harmonize pricing across the complexity of their go-to-market channels in the context of dynamic market and competitive conditions. Our pricing solutions include:
•PROS Control provides a comprehensive pricing platform that offers a single source of accuracy for price management, coordination and strategy. This platform allows businesses to harmonize pricing across go-to-market channels while simultaneously increasing price discipline and protecting price attainment. Pricing users leverage this solution to deploy formulaic price strategies that can incorporate real-time information or conditional data to ensure that every delivered price is up-to-date with the latest market and competitive conditions. With the performance, power and scalability of PROS Control’s Real-Time Pricing Engine, B2B and B2C organizations can replace price lists across commerce channels with dynamic calculations for price requests, ensuring that every delivered price is cognizant of conditions at the time of request. This engine allows businesses facing volatile price competition and underlying component costs to leverage data science 
to systematically adjust pricing in real time. 
•PROS Guidance leverages AI-powered algorithms to provide market-relevant price guidance across sales channels that is dynamically refined to adapt to changing market conditions and buyer behavior. This predictive and prescriptive price guidance provides optimized pricing for each unique buying scenario, which is designed to help businesses drive revenue growth, recover margin leakage, accelerate quote turnaround times and increase win-rates. PROS Guidance works with traditional eCommerce scenarios where a sales person is not involved, as well as where a sales person needs negotiation support, and in all cases this solution provides business-relevant analytics to promote explainability of the AI recommendation.
Airline Revenue Optimization

•PROS Airline Group Sales Optimizer is a group revenue optimization solution powered by dynamic pricing science that enables airlines and their travel agent partners to create and manage group bookings, contracts and policies in one location across users.
Airline eCommerce
    Our Airline eCommerce solutions power airlines to become better retailers by increasing their control and flexibility over how they sell and distribute offers. These solutions provide airlines with scalable shopping, booking and merchandising capabilities to design and distribute offers across individuals and groups. The solutions are powered by proprietary algorithms, compliant with industry pricing and distribution standards and are entirely passenger service system-independent. Our Airline eCommerce suite of products includes:
•PROS Airline Shopping powers airlines' shopping, pricing and repricing by delivering fast, accurate and comprehensive flight offers to travelers across airlines’ sales channels.

Technology
Our high-performance software architecture supports real-time, high-volume transaction processing and enables us to handle the complex and demanding processing requirements of sophisticated global enterprises, including those who require sub-second response times for their customers. We provide the majority of our cloud services via cloud computing platform partners who offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking, located in the United States, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, United Arab Emirates, Australia and other countries. The use of cloud computing platform partners provides us flexibility to service customers at scale and also offer options to comply with in-country data privacy requirements. We also deliver our solutions from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within third-party data center facilities. We offer both single-tenant and multi-tenant cloud solutions.
Artificial Intelligence. More than three decades of data science research and access to very large data sets underlies the robust machine learning and AI capabilities of our solutions. Our dynamic AI, including forecasting, optimization, neural networks, segmentation and reinforcement learning, allows us to leverage our deep science and research expertise in our solutions. These capabilities are industry-independent and are validated using our proprietary verification and testing processes.
Configuration vs. Custom Coding. Our solutions can be configured to meet each customer's business needs through configuration rather than custom code. The configuration capabilities define both a business layer (including definition of user workflows, executive dashboards, analytics views, calculations, approval processes and alerts), as well as a data layer that permits configuration of data structures, including hierarchical dimensions, pricing levels and measures. We maintain our customers' configurations which allows them to use the latest version of our solutions.
Data Integration. The data needed to execute and power personalized digital buying typically resides in multiple sources, such as a company's enterprise resource planning ("ERP"), supply chain management ("SCM"), customer relationship management ("CRM"), eCommerce, reservations and inventory systems, external market data sources, spreadsheets and/or industry-specific transaction systems. Our platform interoperates with many different systems, including those that have been heavily customized to customer requirements. Our data integration capabilities bring data from disparate sources together into a single cohesive database, both in real time and through scheduled batch tasks. We also provide certified content for integration with SAP and integration development services using industry standard tools as well as adapters and integration tools for other common data sources and applications.
Micro-services Architecture. A comprehensive web services interface is at the heart of our architecture. This interface enables extension onto other platforms and the creation of rich integrated solutions.
User Interface. Our technology provides a rich and modern, browser-based interface that supports both local and remote users. This interface supports a wide variety of interactive charts and other data views, and provides a comprehensive security model based on user role and scope of responsibility. This interface operates on a variety of internet browsers, mobile devices and tablets. We also provide native capabilities for Salesforce CRM and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
Subscription Services
    Our subscription services provide customers access to our software via the Internet which, as compared to an on-premises software model, helps reduce their infrastructure, installation and ongoing administration requirements. We also reduce the total cost of ownership of our cloud services over the subscription term by delivering multiple feature releases per year that automatically introduce new features, while preserving previous configurations and integrations that minimize additional customer investment for compatibility. We also offer cloud-based services to allow existing customers who previously purchased licenses to our software to have access to that software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage. 
Sales and Marketing
    We sell and market our software solutions primarily through our direct global sales force and indirectly through go-to-market partners, resellers and systems integrators. Our sales force is organized by our target markets, including automotive and industrial manufacturing, transportation and logistics, chemicals and energy, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. Our marketing activities consist of a variety of programs designed to generate sales leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build awareness of our solutions. We also use digital channels including search and content syndication to reach our target market. We host an annual customer conference, Outperform, where our customers and prospects are invited to learn about best practices from thought leaders, executives and other practitioners in using technology to compete in the digital economy, hear about our latest innovations, and network with peers across industries. We also host other smaller conferences throughout the year, host informational web seminars and participate in and sponsor other industry and trade conferences and organizations. 
Services
    We provide software-related services, including implementation, configuration, consulting and training services. Our software solution implementations have a standardized and tested implementation process developed through years of experience implementing our software solutions in global enterprises across multiple industries. We also offer an array of training on all aspects of our software solutions, from introductory on-demand mini-courses to multi-day hands-on deep 
technical classroom sessions. In addition to our own internal services team, we also work with many globally diverse partners who have been certified to implement our software.
Maintenance and Support
Customers maintaining implementations under on-premises licenses may purchase, at their discretion, maintenance and support services. Maintenance enrollment entitles a customer to solicit support through a web-based interface to submit and track issues, access our online knowledge base, and receive unspecified upgrades, maintenance releases and bug fixes during the term of the support period.
Revenue from maintenance and support services has continued to decline as a percentage of our total revenue since we transitioned to our cloud strategy and sold fewer on-premises licenses to our software. We expect our maintenance revenue to continue to decrease as more existing customers migrate from our legacy on-premises solutions to our cloud solutions. Revenue from maintenance and support services comprised 18%, 23%, and 33% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Customers
We sell our solutions to customers across many industries, including automotive and industrial manufacturing, transportation and logistics, chemicals and energy, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. Our customers are generally large global enterprises and medium-sized businesses, although we also have customers that are smaller in scope of operations. In each of 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had no single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our revenue. Our customers are also geographically diverse, as approximately 67%, 66%, and 65% of our total revenue came from customers outside the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
We provide our customers with several service options including a customer success team to help our customers accelerate the value of their investments in our solutions; a services ecosystem of both our service teams and certified third-party system integrators; 24x7 support; and an online community to facilitate collaboration among our customers and our product development teams.
Competition
The markets for our solutions are competitive, fragmented and rapidly evolving. For example, we have seen consolidation in the quoting software market with large vendors acquiring smaller quoting companies as they attempt to provide end-to-end solutions. Today, we are increasingly competing in a sales ecosystem with competitors that all aim to drive effectiveness and efficiency in selling, although we believe we are unmatched in our ability to deliver sales and pricing AI with speed, scale and precision. We face competition from both larger and smaller competitors, including those providing industry specific software, a portion of our pricing solutions, a portion of our selling solutions, and a portion of our revenue management, retail, shopping and merchandising solutions in the airline industry. To a lesser extent, we compete against large enterprise application providers that have developed offerings that include competing functionality and custom solutions developed internally by businesses, which generally include some combination of spreadsheets, manual processes, external consultants, and internally developed software tools.
The number of companies that we compete with has increased in recent years as we expanded into adjacent technologies. We believe our customers consider the following factors when evaluating our solutions versus competitive solutions: 
•product architecture, functionality, performance, data security, reliability and scalability;
•strength of AI embedded in offerings;
•real-time capabilities;
•customer base and references;
•return on investment, total cost of ownership and time-to-value;
•breadth and depth of product and service offerings;
•depth of expertise in data and pricing science;
•industry domain expertise;
•investment in research and development;
•services and customer support quality;
•size and quality of partner ecosystem;
•existing customer relationships; and
•vendor viability.
We believe that none of our competitors can provide a competitive level of all the functionality needed to support an organization interested in optimizing sales growth through AI-based omnichannel pricing, selling and revenue management. Our competitors generally compete on price or by bundling their applications with other enterprise applications, and we expect that this will continue in the future. We distinguish ourselves from these vendors through our long history of providing software solutions incorporating AI and/or machine learning, the breadth and depth of the functionality we offer, the robust integration and configuration capabilities of our solutions, our ability to handle large data volumes at scale, and our proven ability to provide high-value dynamic science-based optimization software to our global customer base across industries. In the future, we believe our competition will continue to increase as we expand into adjacent market segments.
Intellectual Property 
Our success and ability to compete is dependent, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We protect our intellectual property with a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, patents, trademarks, copyrights and other similar measures. We believe that reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how are generally the most advantageous methods for us to protect our proprietary information.
Research and Development
We believe our software innovation is the foundation of our business and accordingly have made, and continue to make, significant investments in research and development for the enhancement of existing solutions and the development of solutions. We also believe that our long-term investments in AI and machine learning to power pricing and revenue management differentiate us from our competitors. We are committed to continuing the further development of these high-value solutions as evidenced by our continued investment in research and development. In fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred expenses of $75.6 million, $67.2 million and $55.7 million, respectively, in research and development, net of capitalized internal-use software cost, to enhance our existing portfolio of solutions and to develop new solutions. Our research and development expenses include costs associated with our product management, product development and science and research groups. We conduct research and development activities predominantly in Bulgaria, France and the U.S., and also utilize third-party contractors in Bolivia, Colombia, France, India, Romania and Mexico.
We employ data scientists, most of whom are Ph.D.'s, to advance sales, pricing, and revenue management technology and its implementation in our software solutions. These scientists have specialties including, but not limited to, AI, machine learning, operations research, management science, statistics, econometrics and computational methods. Our data scientists regularly interact with our customers, product development, sales, marketing and services team to help keep our science efforts relevant to real-world demands.
Human Capital Resources
Our mission is to help people and companies outperform. To fulfill that mission, we believe we must attract, develop, motivate and retain exceptional employees to maintain our culture and uphold our high ethical standards. As innovation is one of our core values, we believe that our commitment to innovation begins with our commitment to create an environment where our employees can do their best work. To accomplish this, we offer competitive total rewards, invest in ongoing learning and development, promote diversity and inclusion, and focus on employee health, safety and well-being. Oversight of our approach to and investment in human capital management and leadership and talent development are thus key governance matters for the Board of Directors ("Board"). Directly, and through its Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, the Board engages regularly with management on human capital matters. As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,403 full-time personnel, which included 1,235 employees and 168 outsourced personnel. Our team spans 10+ countries, reflecting various backgrounds, ages, gender identities and ethnicities.
At PROS, our values and culture are embedded in everything we do. We proactively look for ways to maintain our collaborative and open company culture and further improve our organizational health, including through regular employee and 
management communication, and periodic team events, as well as through employee pulse surveys. We use insights from our pulse surveys and other employee feedback, including through town halls, leader forums and other communication channels, to inform our human capital resources plans. Our most recent U.S. engagement survey, conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and virtual work, shows the impact of our efforts, with 94% of our U.S.-based team members recommending PROS as a great place to work. Following the conclusion of this survey and submission of other required elements, PROS was designated as a 2020-2021 Great Place to Work-Certified™ company.
We encourage you to visit our website for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Total Rewards. We require a talented workforce to drive innovation, operational excellence, and long-term stockholder value. We also believe that employees should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics, and we constantly strive for pay parity. We define pay parity as ensuring that employees in the same job and location are paid fairly regardless of their gender or ethnicity. To attract and retain a talented workforce, we provide total rewards programs, practices and policies designed to be market-competitive, including by benchmarking and setting pay ranges based on market data, and also considering factors such as an employee’s role, skills, experience, job location and performance. We have invested in analysis and transparency to demonstrate our commitment to fair compensation and opportunity. 
Our human resources management philosophy goes beyond traditional compensation and benefits. We design our total rewards to meet the needs of the whole person, not just the employee, recognizing that life events and circumstances that occur outside of work may impact what happens at work. For example, during 2020 we adopted a trusted time off approach in the U.S. to give employees more flexibility and control over their schedules. Our investments in employee mental health and wellness programs are also cornerstones of this philosophy. During COVID-19 we have added specific employee well-being initiatives discussed below.
Diversity and Inclusion. We believe diversity and inclusion drive innovation and ownership. We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent and upholds high ethical standards. We strive to maintain a working environment that celebrates diverse perspectives, cultures and experiences. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we recognize we still have work to do, including beyond the virtual walls of PROS. 
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a skilled and diverse Board which provides oversight for our human capital resources efforts, including our diversity and inclusion programs and initiatives. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of our Board was comprised of either female and/or ethnically diverse directors, with both female and ethnically diverse representation on our Board for more than 10 years. As of December 31, 2020, women represent 36% of our global employees, and in the U.S., more than half our employees represent minority groups, with underrepresented minorities (defined as those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) representing 26% of our U.S. employees. 

We have a heritage of fostering inclusion and belonging, awareness and education, and social interaction and camaraderie through our employee resource groups. Sponsored and funded by PROS, these employee-led groups are open to any interested employee and create spaces for our people to connect from all walks of life, grow together and build relationships and community. Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, diversity metrics and programs can be found on our website at pros.com/about-pros/diversity-and-inclusion. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Learning and Development. We believe that continuous learning cultivates innovation and that the development of our most important assets, our people, is foundational to fulfill our mission. We regularly invest in our employees’ career growth and provide our employees opportunities for training on a wide range of skills designed to help them to be more effective in their current and future roles. In 2020, over 95% of employees participated in learning and development activities, including thousands of courses across a broad range of categories – leadership, inclusion and diversity, professional skills, technical and compliance. Because the development of our employees and next generation of leaders is critical to our long-term success, we annually engage in a comprehensive talent evaluation and succession planning process, including manager evaluations of all employees and detailed succession planning for all director and above roles with Board oversight for senior management and other key roles.
Pandemic Response. Our top priority during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic remains protecting the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have maintained 
a work-from-home policy for substantially all our employees, materially limited business travel, and we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee physical and mental health. Recognizing that working virtually across a global company is a new and sudden way for all to interact, we instituted several company-wide initiatives to assist our employees in managing through the unprecedented situation, including a mental health awareness day, monthly recharge days and "wellness Wednesdays" with limited scheduled meetings. Additional information on our pandemic response and related wellness initiatives will be included in the 2021 Proxy Statement.
