Overview 
 We are an innovative clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company driven to create and deliver transformative medicines for people living with psychiatric and neurological conditions. Our pipeline is built on the broad therapeutic potential of our lead product candidate, KarXT, an oral modulator of muscarinic receptors that are located both in the central nervous system, or CNS, and various peripheral tissues. KarXT is our proprietary product candidate that combines xanomeline, a novel muscarinic agonist, with trospium, an approved muscarinic antagonist, to preferentially stimulate muscarinic receptors in the CNS. In November 2019, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of KarXT for the treatment of acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia, EMERGENT-1, in which KarXT met the trial’s primary endpoint and was observed to be well tolerated. In December 2020, we initiated EMERGENT-2, the first Phase 3 trial in the EMERGENT program.
 Psychosis is a prominent and debilitating symptom that occurs in many neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and inflammatory neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Schizophrenia is a chronic disabling disorder that is typically diagnosed in the late teenage years or early adulthood and is characterized by recurring episodes of psychosis requiring long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs in most patients. The World Health Organization ranks psychosis as the third-most disabling medical condition in the world. In 2017, an estimated 2.7 million Americans, or approximately 0.5% to 1.0% of the United States population, had schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia experience psychotic symptoms, also known as positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. As a result of the disease, patients with schizophrenia also experience negative symptoms, such as amotivation, flat affect and social withdrawal as well as cognitive impairment. 
 Dementia will affect an estimated 8.4 million people in the United States in 2020, of which approximately 40% are diagnosed with the disease. Dementia includes subtypes of patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, dementia with Lewy Body, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson’s disease dementia. Alzheimer’s disease, or AD, is the most prevalent cause of dementia, accounting for an estimated 60% to 80% of all cases. The prevalence of psychosis in diagnosed dementia patients varies by dementia subtypes between 10% and 75% and in total an estimated 1.2 million dementia patients exhibit psychiatric symptoms, including up to 50% of patients with AD in the United States, which often leads to institutional care in a hospital or nursing home. Patients with dementia-related psychosis, or DRP, share many characteristics and often exhibit similar psychiatric symptoms irrespective of their underlying neurodegenerative disease. 
 Worldwide sales of antipsychotic drugs exceeded $11 billion in 2019 and are expected to exceed $20 billion by 2026, despite a highly generic market. Several branded market-leading antipsychotic medicines have each achieved worldwide annual sales in excess of $5 billion. Despite the large number of antipsychotic drugs developed over the last 20 years, current medicines have undergone only modest innovation relative to first generation drugs developed in the 1950s. In many patients, current antipsychotics are hampered by modest efficacy, significant side effects and safety concerns. At least half of patients fail to adequately respond to antipsychotic drugs. Additionally, in many patients, these treatments are associated with severe side effects including sedation, extrapyramidal side effects, such as motor rigidity, tremors and slurred speech, and significant weight gain resulting in the complications of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The clinical benefit of current antipsychotics is further limited by poor adherence. In a 1,493-patient clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health, approximately 75% of patients reported discontinuing their antipsychotic medication within 18 months of starting treatment. Current antipsychotic treatments work primarily by inhibiting D2 dopamine receptors and frequently 5HT-2A serotonin receptors and are often used by physicians to address a wide range of disorders in addition to schizophrenia, including bipolar disorder and psychotic depression, as well as psychosis and agitation in elderly patients with dementia.

Muscarinic receptor agonists emerged in the 1990s as a potential alternative approach for treating psychosis. There are five distinct muscarinic receptors, M1 through M5, which are found in the brain as well as various peripheral tissues. The link between muscarinic receptor stimulation in the CNS, particularly stimulation of M1 and M4 receptors, the reduction of psychotic symptoms and improvement in cognition, has been well studied and is supported by data from preclinical studies and two third-party clinical trials published in peer reviewed journals. However, the successful development of a therapeutic agent targeting muscarinic receptors has been limited by undesirable side effects that are believed to arise primarily as a result of stimulation of muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues. We believe a therapeutic agent that can preferentially target and stimulate muscarinic receptors in the CNS, but not in peripheral tissues, has the potential to treat psychosis in schizophrenia and DRP, including the associated agitation in patients with DRP. We also believe the preferential stimulation of M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors in the CNS may address the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy, reduced social drive and loss of motivation, as well as cognitive deficits in working memory and attention, all of which currently lack any approved treatments. This approach has the potential to produce a differentiated therapy relative to current D2 dopamine and 5HT-2A serotonin receptor-based antipsychotic drugs and to beneficially impact the lives of millions of patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic and cognitive disorders. 
 We are initially developing our lead product candidate, KarXT, for the treatment of acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. KarXT combines xanomeline, a muscarinic receptor agonist that preferentially stimulates M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors, and trospium, an approved muscarinic receptor antagonist that does not measurably cross the blood-brain barrier, confining its effects to peripheral tissues. M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors are the receptor subtypes believed to mediate the antipsychotic and procognitive effects of xanomeline and other muscarinic agonists. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by third parties support the hypothesis that xanomeline can reduce psychosis and improve cognition. Like all muscarinic receptor agonists studied to date, however, xanomeline’s tolerability has been limited by side effects arising from muscarinic receptor stimulation in peripheral tissues, leading to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and increased salivation and sweating, collectively referred to as cholinergic adverse events. Trospium is a muscarinic receptor antagonist approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of overactive bladder that inhibits all five muscarinic receptor subtypes in peripheral tissues. We believe that a combination therapy of xanomeline and trospium has the potential to preferentially stimulate M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors in the brain without stimulating muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues in order to achieve meaningful therapeutic benefit in patients with psychotic and cognitive disorders. 
 In November 2019, we announced positive results from our EMERGENT-1 trial, a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KarXT for the treatment of acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. In this trial, KarXT met the trial’s primary endpoint with a statistically significant (p<0.0001) and clinically meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, or PANSS, scores over placebo at week 5 (-17.4 KarXT vs. -5.9 placebo). We also observed a statistically significant 3.2 point mean reduction from baseline in the PANSS-positive subscale (-5.6 KarXT v. -2.4 placebo) and a statistically significant 2.3 point mean reduction from baseline in the PANSS-negative subscale (-3.2 KarXT v. -0.9 placebo) at week five (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). The total PANSS, PANSS-positive subscale, and the PANSS-negative subscale had statistically significant separation at every assessment throughout the trial. Following the positive results of EMERGENT-1, we had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in which the FDA confirmed that our completed EMERGENT-1 trial, along with one successful Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial, and additional safety data to meet regulatory requirements, would be acceptable to support a New Drug Application, or NDA, filing. Our EMERGENT program includes EMERGENT-2 and EMERGENT-3, which are five-week in-patient trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of KarXT for the treatment of acute psychosis in adults with schizophrenia. Both trials will share key characteristics of EMERGENT-1, such as duration of treatment, patient population, 1:1 randomization, flexible dose regimen, inclusion/exclusion criteria and primary outcome measure, among other aspects. We commenced EMERGENT-2 in December 2020 and expect to commence EMERGENT-3 in the first half of 2021. Following the five-week inpatient phase in both efficacy trials, patients may enter a 52-week open-label safety and tolerability extension in which all patients will receive treatment with KarXT. We also plan to conduct a separate 52-week open-label trial evaluating the long-term safety of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia who have not been enrolled in the inpatient trials. This 
 6

trial is expected to begin the first half of 2021. We expect to use the data from these trials to support regulatory safety requirements for a new drug application, or NDA, with the FDA.
 In September we presented the results of an exploratory endpoint analysis evaluating the impact of KarXT on cognition in the EMERGENT-1 trial at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Annual Meeting. The analysis demonstrated trends towards improvements in cognition for patients receiving KarXT relative to placebo, with larger benefits seen in patients with greater cognitive impairment at baseline. 
 We are also developing KarXT as a potential treatment for DRP. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we initiated a Phase 1b dose-ranging clinical trial of KarXT designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KarXT in healthy elderly volunteers. We are utilizing a flexible dosing protocol titrated over approximately two to three weeks in order to select the doses and titration protocol for future trials of KarXT in elderly patients with DRP.  We have completed data collection of the first two cohorts and based on our evaluation of the data, we anticipate Cohort 3 to be the final cohort in the Phase 1b trial, with preliminary data expected in the second quarter of 2021. Data from the two completed cohorts suggest that a lower dose ratio of trospium to xanomeline, compared to the ratios used in the previous trials in healthy adult volunteers and in adults with schizophrenia, was better tolerated by healthy elderly volunteers. Cholinergic and anticholinergic adverse events, or AEs, seen in Cohorts 1 and 2 were similar to those observed in prior trials of KarXT. Based on data from Cohorts 1 and 2 from the on-going trial, we believe that potentially therapeutic doses of KarXT can be administered to elderly adults using titration and flexible dosing while maintaining a favorable tolerability profile to provide a path to a Phase 2 trial evaluating KarXT in DRP. We have commenced planning for this Phase 2 DRP trial, and we expect to provide further guidance following the completion of Cohort 3 later this year. 
 We plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial evaluating KarXT for the treatment of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia who have an inadequate response to current standard of care therapies. Given the unique mechanism of action of KarXT in comparison to existing standard of care therapies, we believe there is the potential for greater therapeutic benefit with adjunctive treatment. The trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of KarXT when dosed in conjunction with background antipsychotic treatment. We plan to initiate this trial following the initiation of all trials within the EMERGENT program.
 We have assembled a team whose members have extensive expertise in the research, development and commercialization of numerous CNS agents, as well as deep familiarity with the biology of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and DRP, including the role of muscarinic receptors in potential treatment of these diseases. We plan to leverage this expertise to develop a pipeline of product candidates targeting a broad range of psychiatric and neurological conditions. 
 
Our co-founder and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Miller, Ph.D., was responsible for identifying, developing and testing the initial hypothesis supporting a combination of xanomeline and trospium. We have since assembled a team of employees and advisors who have expertise and extensive experience in developing psychiatric and neurological drugs, including several former scientists at Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly, who were actively involved in xanomeline’s initial development. Steven Paul, M.D., our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman, was formerly the Executive Vice President for Science and Technology and President of the Lilly Research Laboratories at Eli Lilly, where he helped develop the antipsychotic drug Zyprexa and the antidepressant Cymbalta. Dr. Paul was the senior author of the initial publication evaluating xanomeline’s effects in treating psychosis and agitation in patients with AD. Stephen Brannan, M.D., our Chief Medical Officer, was previously the Therapeutic Head of Neuroscience at Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. Alan Breier, M.D., our Chief Clinical Advisor and Chair of our Scientific Advisory Board, was previously Chief Medical Officer at Eli Lilly. 
 Pipeline 
 We are advancing a pipeline of therapeutic programs to address the positive, negative and cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia and DRP. We are leveraging our expertise and experience to explore 
 7

the development of KarXT for additional CNS disorders, as well as advance our other muscarinic-targeted drug candidates and a target-agnostic drug discovery program through our collaboration with PsychoGenics, Inc. 
 

Muscarinic Receptor Biology in the Nervous System 
 Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers secreted by neurons, or nerve cells, to facilitate information flow and communication with other cells, such as muscle or similar nerve cells, in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. As a result, stimulating or inhibiting neurotransmission can have a profound effect on the overall function of an organism. There are many identified neurotransmitters with a variety of structures and functions. One of the key neurotransmitters in the brain is acetylcholine, for which there are two different receptor classes: ion channel-gated nicotinic receptors, and G protein-coupled muscarinic receptors. Within the muscarinic receptor family, there are five subtypes, M1 through M5, all of which are expressed in the brain and in peripheral tissues. 
 Muscarinic receptors serve a number of key physiological roles including in cognitive, behavioral, sensory, motor and autonomic processes. Disruption of muscarinic receptor signaling is believed to contribute to psychosis and cognitive impairment in a wide variety of diseases, including schizophrenia and AD. Conversely, third-party preclinical and clinical data suggest that the enhancement of muscarinic receptor signaling leads to improvement in these same symptoms. M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors in particular have been reported to be under-expressed in the brains of patients with schizophrenia. In animal behavioral models, drug candidates that selectively stimulated M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors have demonstrated improvements in psychosis and cognition. Third-party clinical data suggest that stimulation of M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors may similarly be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of patients with these symptoms. Conversely, inhibition of these receptors has been observed to disrupt memory and cognition, as well as to exacerbate psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. 
 The stimulation of muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues can have significant physiological consequences. In peripheral tissues, such as the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, and salivary and sweat glands, M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors are prominently expressed and have specialized functions. In the gastrointestinal tract, muscarinic receptors play a significant role in regulating gastrointestinal motility. Dosing with agonists that stimulate these muscarinic receptors can lead to diarrhea and increased motility, while dosing with muscarinic antagonists can lead to constipation and decreased motility. In the bladder, stimulation or inhibition of muscarinic receptors modulates bladder contraction leading to increases or decreases in urinary frequency, respectively. Similarly, stimulation of muscarinic receptors in salivary glands and sweat glands can lead to increased salivation and sweating, respectively.

Background and Rationale for KarXT 
 We have designed our lead product candidate, KarXT, to preferentially stimulate M1 and M4 receptors in the brain, without stimulating muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues outside the CNS. We assessed the potential of over 7,000 possible combinations of muscarinic receptor agonists and antagonists to find an optimized combination that could preferentially stimulate muscarinic receptors in the CNS to improve the symptoms of psychosis, while avoiding stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the peripheral tissues and the associated side effects. As a result of our research, we identified xanomeline and trospium as the most promising pairing for development. Trospium is a potent and effective muscarinic receptor antagonist that does not measurably cross the blood-brain barrier, confining its effects to peripheral tissues. We believe that the combination of xanomeline, a centrally-acting muscarinic agonist, and trospium, a peripherally-acting muscarinic antagonist, will have the therapeutic benefits of xanomeline but with markedly reduced side effects. Based on our clinical data with KarXT, either co-administered or co-formulated, and clinical data of xanomeline published by third parties, we believe that KarXT has potential therapeutic benefit in multiple CNS disorders, including the treatment of the positive, negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, psychosis and agitation associated with dementia, including AD. 
 Xanomeline Background 
 Xanomeline as a treatment for psychosis and related neuropsychiatric disorders has been examined in clinicals trials enrolling over 1,000 subjects or patients conducted by us and third parties, with 68 patients being dosed for at least one year and a maximum treatment duration of almost four years. We believe that the results from these clinical trials, as well as results from numerous preclinical studies, supports the further development of xanomeline, in the form of KarXT, as an antipsychotic and procognitive therapeutic agent. 
 Xanomeline for the Treatment of Psychotic Symptoms and Agitation in AD
 Eli Lilly conducted a 343-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of xanomeline in patients with mild to moderate AD, administering up to 225 mg of xanomeline daily (75 mg three times a day, or TID), for 24 weeks. In this clinical trial, 87 patients received placebo, while 85, 83 and 87 patients received 75-150-225 mg of xanomeline, respectively. One patient who entered the trial was assigned to a group but never received study drug or placebo. As shown in the figure below, patients on xanomeline were observed to have dose-dependent decreases in multiple psychotic symptoms and related behaviors, including hallucinations, delusions and agitation, as compared to patients on placebo. For instance, one of the 17 patients (6%) in the placebo arm who presented with hallucinations at baseline had a remission of symptoms while receiving treatment, compared to nine of the 17 patients (53%) in the high-dose xanomeline arm (p=0.003). These responses were seen as early as two to three weeks after commencement of dosing with xanomeline. Xanomeline was also observed to reduce the emergence of psychotic symptoms over the course of the six-month trial in patients who did not have psychotic symptoms at the initiation of the trial. For example, 32% of patients in the placebo arm developed delusions during the trial compared to only 7% in the high-dose xanomeline treatment arm (p=0.001). A dose-response analysis across the 75-150-225 mg xanomeline dose levels reported increasing effects of xanomeline for several symptoms (P<0.05), suggesting that exploration of xanomeline doses above 75 mg TID has the potential for additional therapeutic benefits.

p-value represents the comparison of the 225 mg xanomeline arm compared to placebo and, in the case of the p-value in parenthesis, the dose-response analysis. 
 In this same trial, cognitive symptoms of patients with AD treated with xanomeline also showed improvements compared to placebo as measured by both the ADAS-Cog and the CIBIC+, suggesting that xanomeline may also improve cognition. The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, or ADAS-Cog, is one of the most frequently used tests to measure cognition while the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change plus caregiver interview, or CIBIC+, examines disease severity and changes in behavior, cognition and overall function on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 means markedly improved and 7 means markedly worse. There were high rates of patient discontinuation in the mid-dose (48%) and high-dose (59%) xanomeline cohorts driven in part by side effects, compared to discontinuation rates of 35% and 19% for the placebo and low-dose xanomeline groups, respectively. This high discontinuation rate led to a substantial reduction of statistical power in this trial. Despite this reduction in statistical power, patients in the mid-dose cohort showed a statistically significant benefit on the CIBIC+ as compared to placebo (p=0.02, 4.11 vs. 4.34, respectively). An analysis of patients who completed the trial identified a mean benefit of 2.84 units on the ADAS-Cog for the 225 mg xanomeline arm over placebo (p<0.05), which is similar to the effect seen with donepezil, an approved treatment for the cognitive impairment associated with AD.

Xanomeline for the Treatment of Psychotic Symptoms in Schizophrenia 
 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial of xanomeline was conducted in 20 patients with schizophrenia with acute psychosis, as a collaboration between Eli Lilly and the Indiana University School of Medicine. This monotherapy trial used the PANSS as a primary endpoint. The PANSS is a set of measurements used for evaluating symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia and the change in PANSS score has been used as the primary endpoint in many registrational trials of antipsychotic medicines. As depicted in the figure below, a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 24-point PANSS score difference was observed between xanomeline and placebo after 18 days of treatment, which was the pre-specified analysis time point. By comparison, meta-analyses of published clinicals trials of currently approved antipsychotic medicines report an average difference of nine to ten points in PANSS score versus placebo. Historically, changes as small as five points have supported the approval of current antipsychotics. While this xanomeline trial was designed primarily to evaluate changes in positive symptoms, a six-point improvement in negative symptoms, as measured by the PANSS-negative subscale, was also observed in patients treated with xanomeline as compared to placebo. Improvements in cognitive symptoms, including list learning (p<0.05), story recall (p<0.01), delayed memory (p<0.05) and digit span tests were also observed in patients treated with xanomeline as compared to placebo.

Limitations of Xanomeline 
 Despite xanomeline’s promising therapeutic benefit in treating psychosis and related behavioral symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and AD, its potential has been limited by cholinergic side effects, which are believed to result from the stimulation of muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues. These side effects led to a 59% dropout rate in the high-dose xanomeline group compared to 35% on placebo in Eli Lilly’s six-month AD trial. Syncope, which is a temporary loss of consciousness, was observed in the AD trial (12.6% on high dose xanomeline versus 4.6% on placebo), but not in the schizophrenia trial, in which patients are generally much younger than patients in the AD trial and therefore less prone to syncope. Xanomeline treatment was also associated with transient increases in heart rate and liver function tests, both of which returned to baseline with continued treatment. Electrocardiograms showed no meaningful changes in cardiac conductivity, including QTc interval. 
Our KarXT Programs
 We specifically designed KarXT, a proprietary combination of xanomeline and trospium, to unlock the therapeutic potential of xanomeline by overcoming its limiting side effects resulting from the stimulation of muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues. We believe that the results of two third-party, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of xanomeline, as well as the results of a wide variety of preclinical studies conducted by third parties, support the further development of xanomeline, in the form of KarXT, as an antipsychotic and procognitive therapeutic agent. We selected trospium to counteract xanomeline’s undesirable peripheral side effects for a number of reasons, but importantly because trospium does not measurably cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore would not be expected to negate the therapeutic benefits of xanomeline in the CNS. Trospium is generically available in the United States and European Union for the treatment of overactive bladder and is well-tolerated with limited side effects, that include dry mouth and constipation. Since xanomeline and trospium compete for the same muscarinic receptors in peripheral tissues, 
 12

but with opposing effects, we believe their combination has the potential to reduce the cholinergic side effects of xanomeline. We believe that there are no overlaps in the drug metabolism pathways of xanomeline and trospium and therefore we do not anticipate any significant adverse drug-drug interactions with the combination. Our Phase 1 clinical trial data suggests that each of xanomeline and trospium do not affect the other’s pharmacokinetics or systemic exposure. 
 



We believe that the novel mechanism of KarXT has the potential to provide meaningfully better outcomes for patients suffering from schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric conditions without the debilitating side effects of current D2 dopamine receptor-based therapies, including sedation, extrapyramidal side effects, such as motor rigidity, tremors and slurred speech, and significant weight gain resulting in the complications of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. We obtained an exclusive license to xanomeline from Eli Lilly along with a large database of preclinical and clinical data generated by Eli Lilly supporting xanomeline’s development. Our team of employees and advisors includes several former scientists at Eli Lilly who were actively involved in xanomeline’s preclinical and clinical development to help us advance the development of KarXT.

Proof of Concept of KarXT
 Phase 1 Clinical Trials 
 We observed KarXT’s ability to ameliorate the side effects of xanomeline in our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 clinical trial in 70 healthy volunteers conducted under our investigational NDA. In this trial, we compared the tolerability profile and pharmacokinetics of xanomeline administered with placebo against KarXT co-administered as xanomeline in combination with trospium. Volunteers in this trial first received 40 mg (20 mg twice a day, or BID) of either trospium or placebo for two days, and then received 225 mg of xanomeline (75 mg TID) in addition to their existing regimen of trospium or placebo for seven days. We selected the 225-mg (75 mg TID) dose for evaluation in our trial due to the results of this dose in Eli Lilly’s schizophrenia and AD trials of xanomeline. As depicted in the table below, we observed that the addition of trospium to xanomeline was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in the rate of the most common treatment-emergent cholinergic adverse events, or ChAEs, than reported with xanomeline plus placebo, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and excess sweating and salivation. The overall ChAE rate was 64% on xanomeline plus placebo compared to 34% on KarXT (p=0.016). The rate of ChAEs for volunteers receiving KarXT (34%) was similar to the rate observed in volunteers receiving placebo during the lead-in period (32%), suggesting that the tolerability of KarXT was more similar to the placebo lead-in period than to treatment with xanomeline plus placebo.

ChAE Incidence Rates | Xanomeline+placeboN=33 | KarXTN=35 | % Reduction inIncidence Rates
-----------------------------+------------------------+-----------+------------------------------
Any Cholinergic AE (p=0.016) | 64% | 34% | 46% 
Nausea | 24% | 17% | 29% 
Vomiting | 15% | 6% | 62% 
Diarrhea | 21% | 6% | 73% 
Sweating | 49% | 20% | 59% 
Salivation | 36% | 26% | 29% 

 
We observed no meaningful differences between the KarXT and xanomeline plus placebo treatment groups in heart rate, blood pressure or any electrocardiogram parameters. Only one volunteer discontinued treatment due to treatment emergent adverse events in the KarXT arm, and this discontinuation was voluntary, not at the discretion of the investigator. Two episodes of syncope were observed on xanomeline plus placebo while none were observed with KarXT. We did not observe syncope in the KarXT arm of this trial (or in any other subject treated with KarXT in any of our trials, representing over 140 patients). Rates of postural dizziness were reduced by approximately 57% in patients treated with KarXT as compared to patients treated with xanomeline plus placebo. Overall, we considered treatment with xanomeline 225 mg combined with trospium 40 mg administered over seven days to be well-tolerated. 
 Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose Clinical Trial 
 We have also completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of KarXT. This trial evaluated BID dosing of our proprietary KarXT co-formulation containing fixed ratios of xanomeline and trospium, rather than the TID dosing previously used with xanomeline. We designed our Phase 1 clinical trial based on the improved tolerability of KarXT over xanomeline plus placebo observed in our prior Phase 1 clinical trial and the dose-dependent clinical activity observed in the Eli Lilly AD trial of xanomeline. In particular, Eli Lilly observed that the antipsychotic effect of xanomeline improved when the dose was increased from 25 mg to 50 mg to 75 mg, all administered TID, suggesting that the dose response may extend beyond 75 mg TID and that doses of xanomeline higher than 75 mg TID may lead to additional therapeutic benefit. Based on these observations, we set out to (i) test our co-formulation using BID dosing, (ii) explore higher doses of xanomeline and (iii) optimize the ratio of xanomeline and trospium. Healthy volunteers enrolled in this trial received 50 mg of xanomeline plus 20 mg of trospium (50/20 mg) both BID, on days one and two. From days three to seven, volunteers received BID doses of xanomeline and trospium in ratios of either 100/20 mg, 125/40 mg, 150/20 mg or 150/40 mg (xanomeline/trospium) in different dosing cohorts. The trial was designed to randomize up to 24 volunteers in each of the four cohorts, with a 3:1 randomization of KarXT to placebo. 
 14

In this trial, administration of KarXT co-formulation provided robust xanomeline and trospium exposures as measured by plasma levels. In particular, KarXT containing xanomeline 100 mg BID provided drug exposures equivalent to, or higher than, 75 mg of xanomeline TID when administered alone. KarXT was also well-tolerated in volunteers at dose levels of 100 mg and 125 mg of xanomeline BID when paired with 20 mg and 40 mg of trospium, respectively. 
 Eighteen volunteers received KarXT in the 100/20 mg cohort. In this group, 16 volunteers experienced either no ChAEs (n=11; 61%) or mild, transient ChAEs (n=5; 28%). The majority of ChAEs were reported for less than one hour over the seven days of treatment and the longest duration reported was a total of 15 hours over the course of treatment. Two volunteers (11%) experienced transient ChAEs that were rated as moderate, with the longest ChAE lasting a total of approximately 11 hours over the course of treatment. Given the transient and generally mild nature of the ChAEs, we considered the 100/20 mg dose level of KarXT well tolerated. Eighteen volunteers were given the 125/40 mg dose level of KarXT, of which 11 volunteers (61%) reported no ChAEs and seven volunteers (39%) reported mild, transient ChAEs. These mild ChAEs lasted less than three hours over the course of the seven-day treatment period. The increased dose of trospium (40 mg BID) was associated with reports of mild anticholinergic adverse events, including dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and urinary hesitancy, suggesting a decreased trospium dose level may be more appropriate to pair with 125 mg BID of xanomeline. Xanomeline doses of 150 mg in KarXT led to increased reporting of moderate ChAEs and were therefore less well-tolerated than either the 100 or 125 mg xanomeline doses. 
 In this Phase 1 clinical trial, we observed that KarXT doses containing either 100 mg or 125 mg of xanomeline administered BID were well-tolerated when paired with trospium. Importantly, the 100 mg BID dose level administered in our co-formulation provided blood exposures equal to or greater than those observed by us and Eli Lilly with 75 mg TID xanomeline, which was observed to have beneficial effects on psychosis and cognition in both schizophrenia and AD. While a minority of patients still experienced ChAEs, these were predominately mild and transient in nature. We believe this tolerability profile has the potential to provide a substantial improvement over current antipsychotic medicines, which are often not tested at therapeutic doses in healthy volunteers due to their poor tolerability. Based on the results of this trial, we identified 100/20 mg and 125/30 mg BID as the doses and ratios of xanomeline to trospium to evaluate in our Phase 2 clinical trial of KarXT for acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. 
 We submitted an Investigational New Drug application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for KarXT for the treatment of schizophrenia, which went into effect in August 2016. 
 KarXT for the Treatment of Acute Psychosis in Patients with Schizophrenia 
 Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder. In 2017, an estimated 2.7 million Americans, or approximately 0.5% to 1.0% of the U.S. population, had schizophrenia. Worldwide, it is estimated that schizophrenia affects over 21 million people. People with schizophrenia have a 10 to 15-year reduction in life expectancy compared to the general population, struggle to maintain employment or live independently and are often unable to maintain meaningful interpersonal relationships. 
 Psychosis is a prominent and debilitating symptom that occurs in schizophrenia. Psychotic symptoms, also known as positive symptoms, include hallucinations and delusions. Patients with schizophrenia also experience negative symptoms, such as apathy, reduced social drive, loss of motivation and lack of social interest. Schizophrenia is also often associated with significant cognitive impairment, which further limits a patient’s ability to be gainfully employed and maintain relationships. 
 Worldwide sales of antipsychotic drugs exceeded $11 billion in 2015 and are expected to exceed $14 billion by 2025, despite a highly generic market. Several branded market leading antipsychotic medicines have each achieved worldwide annual sales in excess of $5 billion. Despite the large number of antipsychotic drugs developed over the last 20 years, current medicines have undergone only modest innovation relative to first generation drugs developed in the 1950s.

Current antipsychotics have modest efficacy in many patients and significant side effects and safety concerns. At least half of patients fail to adequately respond to current antipsychotic drugs. Additionally, current treatments are often associated with severe side effects, including sedation, extrapyramidal side effects such as motor rigidity, tremors and slurred speech, and significant weight gain resulting in the complications of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The clinical benefit of current antipsychotics is further limited by poor adherence. In a 1,493-patient clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health, approximately 75% of patients reported discontinuing their antipsychotic medication within 18 months of starting treatment. 
 Current antipsychotic treatments work primarily by inhibiting D2 dopamine receptors and are often used by physicians to address a wide range of disorders in addition to schizophrenia, including bipolar disorder and psychotic depression, as well as psychosis and agitation in elderly patients with dementia. These treatments are approved for the treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions, but there are no approved therapies for the treatment of negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. We believe there is a substantial need for a new antipsychotic drug that has an improved efficacy and side effect profile, and for a drug that can treat the negative and cognitive symptoms of the disease. 
 The regulatory requirements, including clinical trial design and primary endpoints, for approval of antipsychotic drugs for this indication are well understood and defined. Similarly, third-party clinical trial operators and contract research organizations have extensive experience conducting drug trials in schizophrenia. Finally, patients with schizophrenia in clinical trials are generally younger than patients suffering psychosis from other CNS disorders such as DRP, which reduces the risk of comorbidities, and patients with schizophrenia also tend to have higher drug tolerability due to their prior treatment with antipsychotic drugs. We believe that these factors will help us to efficiently progress KarXT in this indication.
 Our Phase 2 Clinical Trial for the Treatment of Acute Psychosis 
 In September 2018, we initiated EMERGENT-1, a multi-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, five-week, inpatient Phase 2 clinical trial of KarXT in patients with schizophrenia with acute psychosis. We enrolled 182 patients in this trial and patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either KarXT or placebo. Patients were washed out of any existing antipsychotic medications before entering the five-week active treatment or placebo phase. After the wash-out period, patients began with either placebo or KarXT containing 50 mg xanomeline and 20 mg trospium (50/20 mg) BID. Patients receiving KarXT then increased their dose to 100/20 mg BID on day three and then physicians had the option to escalate to 125/30 mg BID starting on day eight if the 100/20 mg BID dose was well-tolerated. The primary endpoint in this trial was the change from baseline in PANSS total scores for KarXT versus placebo treated patients at week five. Our trial had the same fundamental design and primary endpoint as the previous xanomeline trial in psychosis in schizophrenia, which is also the design that has been used in pivotal trials for several currently approved antipsychotic medicines. Additional endpoints of our trial included changes in PANSS Marder Factor score (including the negative symptom factor), a cognitive battery and the clinical global impression (CGI-S). 
 In November 2019, we announced topline results from our EMERGENT-1 trial, in which KarXT met the trial’s primary endpoint with a statistically significant (p<0.0001) and clinically meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total PANSS scores over placebo at week 5 (-17.4 KarXT vs. -5.9 placebo). We also observed a statistically significant 3.2 point mean reduction from baseline in the PANSS-positive subscale (-5.6 KarXT v. -2.4 placebo) and a statistically significant 2.3 point mean reduction from baseline in the PANSS-negative subscale (-3.2 KarXT v. -0.9 placebo) at week five (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). The total PANSS, PANSS-positive subscale, and the PANSS-negative subscale had statistically significant separation at every assessment throughout the trial. 
 In addition, we analyzed additional pre-specified secondary endpoints, including PANSS-Marder factor score, CGI-S frequency counts and percentage of CGI-S responders, defined as a CGI-S rating of either 1 or 2 at week five. We observed a statistically significant 2.5 point mean reduction from baseline in the PANSS Marder factor score (-3.9 KarXT v. -1.3 placebo) at week five (p<0.001). The PANSS Marder factor score had statistically significant separation at every assessment point through the trial. We also observed statistically 
 16

significant different CGI-S frequency counts for KarXT compared to placebo at week five (p<0.001). A 4:1 ratio of CGI-S responders (5.6% KarXT v. 1.4% placebo) was also observed, however this result was not statistically significant (p=0.151).

 KarXT was observed to be well tolerated in this Phase 2 trial. The overall discontinuation rate in the KarXT treatment arm was similar to placebo (20% on KarXT vs. 21% on placebo) and the number of discontinuations due to treatment emergent adverse events was equal in the two arms (n=2 on KarXT and n=2 on placebo). No patients discontinued treatment due to cholinergic adverse events in either arm of the trial. 91% of patients treated with KarXT escalated to the high dose of KarXT as part of the flexible dose design, where the choice to escalate was made by the site physician based on the tolerability of KarXT on an individual patient basis. 97% of placebo patients were dose escalated. There was also the option to de-escalate back to 
 19

100/20 mg BID KarXT dose if any tolerability issues emerged, and only 4% of patients were de-escalated in the KarXT arm compared to 1% on placebo. The overall treatment emergent adverse event rate was 54% on KarXT and 43% on placebo. Occurrences of drowsiness, extrapyramidal side effects, such as tremors or slurred speech, or weight gain, which are adverse effects generally associated with current antipsychotic drugs, were similar to placebo. The most common adverse events were constipation, nausea, dry mouth, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting, all of which were mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature. Placebo-adjusted rates of nausea, vomiting and dry mouth all decreased over time during the trial. There was no syncope, and there was no mean change in blood pressure. One patient in the KarXT group discontinued due to elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase. There was a 5.5 beats per minute peak mean placebo adjusted resting heart rate increase in the KarXT group, with a downward trend after week 2. One serious adverse event was observed in the KarXT treatment group, in which a patient discontinued and sought hospital care for worsening psychosis, meeting the regulatory definition of serious adverse event. The clinical trial administrator was not able to rule out that the serious adverse event was drug related, and as such, the serious adverse event was classified as being “possibly-drug related.” All other treatment emergent adverse events were mild or moderate. 
 Our Ongoing and Planned Clinical Trials for the Treatment of Acute Psychosis in Adults with Schizophrenia  
 Following the positive results of EMERGENT-1, we had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in which the FDA confirmed that our completed EMERGENT-1 trial, along with one successful Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial, and additional safety data to meet regulatory requirements, would be acceptable to support an NDA filing. As such, we will conduct the following trials as part of our EMERGENT program, which together with additional preclinical, CMC, clinical and other related activities will support our NDA filing for KarXT for the treatment of acute psychosis in adults with schizophrenia:

• | EMERGENT-2 is a five-week, inpatient, 1:1 randomized, flexible-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of KarXT in 246 adults with schizophrenia in the U.S. EMERGENT-2 was initiated in December 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EMERGENT-3 is a five-week, inpatient, 1:1 randomized, flexible-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of KarXT in 246 adults with schizophrenia in the U.S. and E.U. We expect EMERGENT-3 to initiate in the first half of 2021.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EMERGENT-4 is a 52-week, outpatient, open-label extension trial evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia who completed EMERGENT-2 or EMERGENT-3. EMERGENT-4 enrolled its first patient in the first quarter of 2021.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EMERGENT-5 is a 52-week, outpatient, open-label trial evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in adults with schizophrenia who have not been enrolled in the EMERGENT-2 or EMERGENT-3 trials. We expect to commence EMERGENT-5 in the first half of 2021.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial evaluating KarXT as an adjunctive therapy with standard of care for the treatment of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia who remain symptomatic on existing therapies. We previously planned to initiate a Phase 1b trial assessing potential Drug-Drug Interactions with a selection of currently marketed antipsychotics in healthy volunteers, but based on multiple considerations, including the evaluation of existing preclinical and clinical data supporting the potential of KarXT to augment traditional antipsychotic drugs, we plan to move forward directly to initiate a Phase 2 trial. The trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of KarXT when dosed in conjunction with background antipsychotic treatment and its potential to improve symptoms in patients who had not achieved an adequate response on their current antipsychotic treatment. We plan to initiate this trial following the initiation of all trials within the EMERGENT program.
 Our Planned Clinical Trials for the Negative and Cognitive Symptoms of Schizophrenia 
 We plan to utilize the data from our EMERGENT-1 trial to help us guide KarXT’s future development for negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, for which there are currently no approved treatments. 
 20

In September 2020 we presented the results of an exploratory endpoint analysis evaluating the impact of KarXT on cognition in the EMERGENT-1 trial at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Annual Meeting. The analysis demonstrated trends towards improvements in cognition for patients receiving KarXT relative to placebo, with larger benefits seen in patients with greater cognitive impairment at baseline. We plan to collect data on the potential benefit of KarXT on negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia as part of the ongoing EMERGENT program and our planned trial to evaluate KarXT in patients who have an inadequate response to current standard of care therapies described below, and will continue to evaluate the timing and design of potential trials specifically directed towards the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.

KarXT for the Treatment of Dementia-Related Psychosis 
 Approximately 8.4 million people in the United States are living with dementia of which approximately 40% are diagnosed with the disease. The prevalence of psychosis in diagnosed dementia patients varies by dementia subtypes between 10% and 75% and in total an estimated 1.2 million dementia patients exhibit psychiatric symptoms. Patients with DRP share many characteristics and often exhibit similar psychiatric symptoms irrespective of their underlying neurodegenerative disease. AD is the most common form of dementia and represents between 60% and 80% of dementia patients. AD is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and cognition and, eventually, the ability to carry out even the simplest of tasks. In the large and growing AD population, up to 50% of patients will experience psychosis and related behavioral symptoms at some point during the course of their disease, which often leads to institutional care in a hospital or nursing home. Based on third-party clinical trials with xanomeline and xanomeline’s mechanisms of action, we believe KarXT has therapeutic potential to treat DRP. To date, the FDA has not approved any drug to treat the psychotic or behavioral symptoms of DRP. As symptoms progress and become more severe, physicians often resort to off-label use of antipsychotic medications to treat these patients. Current antipsychotic drugs are associated with a number of side effects including potentially irreversible movement disorders, weight gain, metabolic dysfunction and sedation, which can be more problematic in elderly patients with DRP. In addition, antipsychotic drugs all have a “boxed warning” for increased mortality in the elderly and may exacerbate the cognitive impairment associated with DRP. Accordingly, there remains a large unmet medical need in psychosis and the associated behavioral symptoms of patients with DRP. 
 21

Our On-Going Phase 1b Healthy Elderly Volunteer Clinical Trial 
 Based on Eli Lilly’s Phase 2 clinical trial of xanomeline in patients with AD, and the improved tolerability profile of KarXT as compared to xanomeline, in December 2019, we initiated a Phase 1b dose-ranging clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of KarXT in healthy elderly volunteers. We are utilizing a flexible dosing protocol titrated over approximately two to three weeks in order to select the doses and titration protocol for future trials of KarXT in elderly patients with DRP. 
 We have completed data collection of the first two cohorts in our ongoing Phase 1b trial in healthy elderly volunteers. Based on our evaluation of the data, we anticipate Cohort 3 to be the final cohort in the Phase 1b trial, with preliminary data expected in the second quarter of 2021.  
 The two completed cohorts consisted of 16 volunteers, randomized 3:1 to receive KarXT or placebo. As part of the flexible dosing protocol, a volunteer’s dose was increased if they were tolerating KarXT well at the time of the potential dose increase, as determined by the clinician. In both cohorts, healthy elderly volunteers achieved mean xanomeline blood levels comparable to, or slightly higher than, the mean xanomeline blood levels reported in our EMERGENT-1 trial, which had demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in total PANSS score in adults with schizophrenia. The majority of healthy elderly volunteers in both cohorts were titrated to xanomeline doses of 150 to 200 mg when dosed with KarXT three times per day. Data from the two completed cohorts suggest that a lower dose ratio of trospium to xanomeline, compared to the ratios used in the previous trials in healthy adult volunteers and in adults with schizophrenia, was better tolerated by healthy elderly volunteers. We believe factors including lower body weight, metabolism rate, and drug excretion rates of the healthy elderly volunteers in these cohorts may allow lower oral doses to achieve target drug exposure levels compared to other populations. 
 Cholinergic and anticholinergic AEs seen in Cohorts 1 and 2 were similar to those observed in prior trials of KarXT. The vast majority of AEs (>80%) were rated as mild and no syncopal events were observed. In Cohort 1, one serious adverse event, or SAE, of urinary retention was reported related to the higher dose of trospium used in Cohort 1. In Cohort 2, which utilized a lower trospium dose, all AEs were rated mild or moderate in severity and there were no SAEs. Cohort 3 will serve to further refine the dose range of xanomeline and trospium and titration protocol. 
 The design of the trial is similar to our previously completed Phase 1 dose-ranging trial in healthy adult volunteers that was used to select doses for EMERGENT-1, our completed Phase 2 trial in adults with schizophrenia. In our previously completed Phase 1 trial of healthy adults, we enrolled four cohorts of volunteers and evaluated a range of xanomeline and trospium doses, including xanomeline doses that exceeded the doses selected for the subsequently completed the Phase 2 EMERGENT-1 trial. Further, our proprietary formulation of KarXT led to an approximate 10% increase in blood levels of xanomeline compared to prior xanomeline only formulations that were evaluated by Eli Lilly and Company. 
 Based on data from Cohorts 1 and 2 from the on-going trial, we believe that potentially therapeutic doses of KarXT can be administered to elderly adults using titration and flexible dosing while maintaining a favorable tolerability profile to provide a path to a Phase 2 trial evaluating KarXT in DRP. We have commenced planning for this Phase 2 DRP trial, and we expect to provide further guidance following the completion of Cohort 3 later this year.
 Planned Additional Formulations of KarXT 
 We believe that additional formulations of KarXT have the potential to further improve the therapeutic window of KarXT and offer patient compliance advantages through decreased dosing frequency. Our ongoing research efforts include the development of advanced oral, long-acting injectable, transdermal and buccal formulations. We plan to have an additional oral formulation of KarXT in Phase 1 clinical trials in 2021.
 Other Research Programs 
 22

We continue to build our early stage pipeline. We currently have a novel series of compounds focused on muscarinic receptor targets. In particular, we have synthesized lead compounds for further development as potential therapeutic agents in several CNS disorders, including schizophrenia and DRP. We have completed in vitro screening for several compounds and advanced these lead compounds for further preclinical development. In vivo evaluation of these compounds in rodents is ongoing for these indications, and we expect to initiate IND-enabling studies in 2021. We believe we can optimize these compounds and advance their development through preclinical studies and into clinical development, given our expertise in this space. In February 2020 we announced a drug discovery partnership with Charles River Laboratories to accommodate continued growth in our muscarinic receptor drug discovery efforts. In July 2020 we announced a drug discovery collaboration with Psychogenics, Inc. to discover novel drug candidates for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. We continue to evaluate other opportunities focused on muscarinic and non-muscarinic targets for CNS disorders. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently source all of our nonclinical and clinical compound supply through third-party contract manufacturing/ organizations, or CMOs. We have established a robust supply chain to enable sufficient supply of the raw materials needed to conduct our EMERGENT program, as well as support NDA application. We continue to expand our manufacturing network to ensure redundant supply of critical input materials. 
 For clinical supply, we use CMOs who act in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLP, and current good manufacturing practices, cGMP, for the manufacture of drug substance and product. Currently, we contract with Neuland Laboratories Limited and Regis Technologies, Inc., for the manufacture of xanomeline and source trospium from Procos, S.p.A. We expect to rely on third parties for our manufacturing processes and the production of all clinical supply drug substance and drug product. We use additional contract manufacturers to fill, label, package, store and distribute investigational drug products. It is our intent to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of a new drug application to the FDA for any product candidates that complete clinical development. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies as well as public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize, including KarXT, may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of KarXT, and any other product candidates that we develop to address CNS disorders, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Psychosis in patients with schizophrenia 
 23

There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the negative or cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. The current standards of care for the psychotic symptoms of patients with schizophrenia are antipsychotic treatments that work primarily by inhibiting D2 dopamine and 5HT2-A serotonin receptors as their primary mechanism of action. These drugs include: Abilify, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Zyprexa, marketed by Eli Lilly, Vraylar, marketed by Allergan, Clozaril, marketed by Mylan Products Ltd., Latuda, marketed by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd., and Caplyta, marketed by Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. Many of these drugs are prescribed for a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder, depression and Tourette syndrome. Additionally, we are aware of several product candidates in clinical development that are designed to modulate dopamine and/or serotonin receptors including product candidates being developed by Alkermes plc, ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Cerevel Therapeutics, LLC. 
Dementia-Related Psychosis 
 There are currently no approved treatments for DRP, including psychosis related to AD. Patients with DRP are commonly treated with antipsychotic medications that are indicated and approved for schizophrenia. Currently, there is one drug, marketed and developed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals, for which the FDA is evaluating an sNDA application for marketing authorization for the treatment of DRP. Available treatments for AD patients are only indicated for enhancing cognition in AD patients, and include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine. These medications are available generically although specific dosage forms and combinations are proprietary and marketed by large pharmaceutical companies such as, Allergan, Janssen Pharmaceuticals NV, Novartis International AG and Pfizer Inc. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover our product candidate and their methods of use, as well as other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that we do not consider appropriate for patent protection. 
 Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, particularly our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. 
 
The patent positions for biotechnology companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our platform technologies and product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 Product Candidates
 With regard to our KarXT product candidate, we exclusively license from PureTech Health LLC, or PureTech Health, a patent family comprising two issued U.S. patents with claims directed to an oral medicament comprising certain doses of xanomeline and/or the salt thereof and certain doses of trospium chloride, three issued U.S. patents with claims directed to methods for treating central nervous system disorders using an oral medicament comprising certain doses of xanomeline and/or salts thereof and certain doses of trospium chloride, issued patents in Canada, Europe, and Hong Kong, and a total of four patent applications pending, one in each of the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong. The patents and the pending 
 24

patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2030 without taking into account a possible Patent Term Extension, or PTE, or any possible patent term adjustments. We also own one issued U.S. patent and three pending U.S. patent applications, one of which is allowed, and a pending PCT application with claims directed towards an oral pharmaceutical composition, comprising a plurality of xanomeline beads having a core comprising xanomeline or a salt thereof, and a plurality of trospium beads having a core comprising a salt of trospium. The patent and the pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2039 without taking into account a possible PTE or any possible patent term adjustments. We also own one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application and one pending PCT application with claims directed to the use of KarXT for treating schizophrenia or a disease related to schizophrenia in a patient in need thereof. The patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2040 without taking into account a possible PTE or any possible patent term adjustments. We also own two pending U.S. provisional patent applications, one pending U.S. patent application, and two PCT applications with claims directed to compounds targeting muscarinic receptors and methods of treatment using such compounds. The patent applications claiming priority to and the benefit of these provisional applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2040 or 2041 without taking into account a possible PTE or any possible patent term adjustments. Our U.S. and foreign patent applications also disclose other muscarinic activators in combination with other muscarinic inhibitors to treat CNS disorders. 
 License Agreements 
 License Agreement with Eli Lilly and Company 
 In May 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the Lilly License Agreement, with Eli Lilly, pursuant to which Eli Lilly assigned to us all of its rights to certain patents (now expired), regulatory documentation, data records and materials related to xanomeline. We are also entitled to sublicense or otherwise transfer the rights granted in connection with the Lilly License Agreement.

 We may terminate the Patent License Agreement for any reason with proper prior notice to PureTech Health. Either party may terminate the Patent License Agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. In addition, an applicant may need to recall a product. 
 
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 
  
• | completion of nonclinical, or preclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated at that site;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 26

 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;

• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before an applicant begins testing a compound in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 The IND and IRB Processes 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of the investigational drug. In an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. 
 27

A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. FDA must also be able to validate the data from the study through an on-site inspection if necessary. 
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review of the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects, or their legal representative, provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial regulatory approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. In addition, within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the applicant must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Combination Rule 
 The FDA’s Combination Rule governing fixed combination drug products provides that two or more drugs may be combined in a single dosage form when each component contributes to the claimed effects and the dosage of each component (amount, frequency, duration) is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy as defined in the labeling for the drug. This rule is meant to ensure that any fixed-dose combination drug provides an advantage to the patient over and above that obtained when one of the individual ingredients is used in the usual safe and effective dose. 
 Review of an NDA by the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a significant application user fee as well as annual prescription drug product program fees. These fees are typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt, before accepting the NDA for filing, to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Applications for drugs containing new molecular entities are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and applications for “priority review” products containing new molecular entities are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 29

During its review of an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. 
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Priority Review 
 The FDA has a number of programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. Three of these programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 30

Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, could result in the FDA’s withdrawal of the approval and require the withdrawal of the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and select clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA to address all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request a hearing. If the applicant resubmits the NDA, only when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction will the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on 
 31

the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety or effectiveness after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. 
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, many changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are annual prescription drug product program fee requirements for certain marketed products. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA holder and any third-party manufacturers that the NDA holder may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 32

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 
Hatch-Waxman Amendments 
 Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product, known as a reference listed drug, or RLD. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. 
 Non-Patent Exclusivity 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE. For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, which states the proposed generic drug will not infringe one or more of the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity for non-NCE drugs if the NDA or a supplement to the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application or supplement. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication, but it generally would not protect the original, unmodified product from generic competition. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product; it only prevents FDA from approving such ANDAs. 
 33

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
 In seeking approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Upon submission of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the RLD in the Orange Book that: 
  
• | no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | such patent has expired;
--+-------------------------


• | the date on which such patent expires; or
--+------------------------------------------


• | such patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a paragraph IV certification the applicant must send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation. If the drug has NCE exclusivity and the ANDA is submitted four years after approval, the 30-month stay is extended so that it expires seven and a half years after approval of the innovator drug, unless the patent expires or there is a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant before then. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent term restoration of up to seven and a half years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question and within 60 days of drug approval. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union. 
 Clinical Trial Approval 
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States (without national implementation) following confirmation of the full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System, the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the new Regulation, through an independent audit. This is currently expected to occur in December 2021. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. 
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
 The United Kingdom has implemented Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations, so the United Kingdom’s regulation of clinical trials is currently aligned with EU regulations. Whether the United Kingdom will amend its legislation to align more closely with the new EU Regulation once that comes into effect is as yet unknown. 
 35

Marketing Authorization 
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU Member States and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of HIV or AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation and whose authorization would be in the interest of public health at EU level, the centralized procedure is optional. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 67 days from the date of the CHMP Opinion, the European Commission will adopt its final decision on the marketing authorization application. 
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. 
 
The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State. 
 36

Under the above described procedures, before granting the marketing authorizations, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area (EEA) make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety, and efficacy.
 Now that the United Kingdom has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized EU authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain’s marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to marketing authorizations approved in EEA Member States through Decentralized or Mutual Recognition Procedures with a view to more quickly granting a marketing authorization in the United Kingdom or Great Britain. 
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union 
 In the European Union, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the European Union market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained 
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the European Union is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 
  
• | Compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 37


 
• | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable European Union laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with European Union cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union notably under Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

European Data Collection Regulation
 In the event we decide to conduct clinical trials in the European Union, we may be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection and use of personal health information in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive (which governs the collection and use of personal health data in the European Union), the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduced new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 In addition, further to the United Kingdom's (UK) exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law (referred to as the 'UK GDPR'). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The UK, however, is now regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR which means that transfers of personal data from the EEA to the UK will be restricted unless an appropriate safeguard, as recognised by the EU’s GDPR, has been put in place. Although, under the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement it is lawful to transfer personal data between the UK and the EEA for a 6 month period following the end of the transition period, with a view to achieving an adequacy decision from the European Commission during that period. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection (this means that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing).
 Healthcare and Privacy Laws and Regulation
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals and patient privacy laws and regulations and other 
 38

healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare and privacy laws and regulations, include the following: 
  
• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. On November 20, 2020, OIG finalized further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. These rule (with exceptions) became effective January 19, 2021. We continue to evaluate what effect, if any, these rules will have on our business;

• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or FCA, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;

• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal civil and criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;

HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;

• | some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, and drug pricing information. Certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from 
 40

the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes contains to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions of importance to our potential product candidates, including among other things, that: 
  
• | created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount, which was increased to 70% by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (as of January 1, 2019), off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 41

 
beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. While some proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on September 25, 2019, the Senate Finance Committee introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Action of 2019, a bill intended to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug prices. The proposed legislation would restructure the Part D benefit, modify payment methodologies for certain drugs, and impose an inflation cap on drug price increases. An even more restrictive bill, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 19, 2019, and would require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. It is unclear whether either of these bills will make it through both chambers and be signed into law, and if either is enacted, what effect it would have on our business. Individual states in the United States have also 
 42

increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
