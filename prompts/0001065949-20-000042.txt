Reports to Security Holders
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and as such, we intend to file all required disclosures.
 
You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC in the SEC’s Public Reference Section, Room 1580, 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Section by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) as we did not have more than $1,000,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of December 31, 2019, our last fiscal year.
 
We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1,000,000,000 or (ii) we issue more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement.
 
As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable to generally reporting companies. These provisions include:
 

- | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statement and only two years of related Management Discussion and Analysis Disclosures: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such sections are provided below:
 
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls.
 
Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.
 
We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act.

CURRENT BUSINESS
 
We intend to be engaged in the real estate and land development business in the United States. We intend to develop a portfolio of development opportunities in various stages along with opportunistic acquisitions and partnerships in our core-markets. We operate under Stratus Capital Corp. We have historical presence and management experience in the mid-west and south-east regions. We plan to organize our business into the following operating segments:

Early
Stage Land Development
In-fill
Development of Single-Family Attached and Multi-Family Product
Opportunistic
Joint-Ventures, Partnerships, and Lending

Organizational Structure
 

Stratus Capital Corporation

Organizational Structure 
LAND DEVELOPMENT | COMMERCIAL, RESIDENTIAL & MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT | JOINT-VENTURES, PARTNERSHIPS AND LENDING 
ENTITLEMENT | SINGLE & MULTI FAMILY PRODUCT | INFILL JOINT-VENTURES 
ASSET REPOSITIONING | SENIOR HOUSING | STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS 
DEVELOPMENT | CONSTRUCTION SERVICES | STRATEGIC LENDING 

Business Strategy
 
Our long-term strategy:
 

• | Pursuing opportunities within our core markets;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Developing high-quality relationships with our asset partners; 


• | Maintaining a cost-efficient culture; and


• | Appropriately balancing risk and opportunity.

 
We are committed to improving the communities we work within and enhancing the lifestyle of our neighborhoods. Delivering on this involves thoughtful planning to accommodate the needs of our various customers, homeowners and the surrounding community. We engage unaffiliated civil and architectural firms to develop and augment existing plans in order to ensure that our developments reflect current market updates to complement our surrounding communities.
 
We intend to acquire our assets in core locations where we can target maximizing long-term shareholder value and operate our business to capitalize on market appreciation and mitigate risks from economic downturns as we recognize the cyclical nature of the national real estate market. We intend to regularly assess our capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder return. We also take advantage of joint venture opportunities, partnerships and lending opportunities as they arise in order to secure asset allocations to share risk and maximize returns.

We intend to execute this strategy by:
 

• | Increasing our existing land supply through expanding market presence; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Combining land acquisition and development expertise with development operations; 


• | Maintaining an efficient capital structure;


• | Selectively investing in joint-ventures, partnerships and lending opportunities; and 


• | Employing and retaining a highly experienced management team with a strong operating track record. 

Land and Development Strategies
 
Community development includes the acquisition and development of communities, which may include obtaining significant planning and entitlement approvals and completing construction of off-site and on-site utilities and infrastructure. We intend to generally operate as small community developers, but in some communities, we operate solely as merchant builders, in which case, we acquire fully planned and entitled lots and may construct on-site improvements or in-fill opportunities.
 
In order to maximize our expected risk-adjusted return, the allocation of capital for land investment is performed in the discretion of our management (2 persons) at the corporate level with a disciplined approach to overall portfolio management. Macro and micro indices, including but not limited to employment, housing starts, new home sales, re-sales and foreclosures, along with market related shifts in competition, land availability and consumer preferences, are carefully analyzed to determine our land and homebuilding strategy. Our long-term plan is compared on an ongoing basis to current conditions in the marketplace as they evolve and is adjusted to the extent necessary.
 
Community Integration
 
We intend to complement each community or neighborhood and governing municipality we interact with, beginning with an overall community master plan and then determining the specific asset opportunity to maximize returns for our shareholders and the stakeholders of the area. After necessary governmental and other approvals have been obtained, we intend to improve the assets as planned.
 
The life cycle of an asset generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition or investment in the asset and continuing through the development phase, concluding with the sale, construction or delivery of product types. The actual life cycle will vary based on the asset type, the development cycle and the general market conditions.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
When we commence our business plan of development, based on local market practices, we either directly, or indirectly through our subcontractors, intend to purchase drywall, cement, steel, lumber, insulation and the other building materials necessary to construct the various residential product asset classes we develop. While these materials are generally widely available from a variety of sources, from time to time we may experience material shortages on a localized basis which can substantially increase the price for such materials and our construction process can be slowed. We have multiple sources for the materials we intend to purchase, which will decrease the likelihood that we would experience significant delays due to unavailability of necessary materials.
Trades and Labor
 
Our construction, land and purchasing teams will coordinate subcontracting services and supervise all aspects of construction work and quality control. We intend to act as a general contractor for residential projects.
 
Subcontractors perform construction and land development scopes of work, generally under fixed-price contracts. The availability of labor, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, at reasonable prices can be challenging

in some markets as the supply chain responds to uneven industry growth and other economic factors that affect the number of people in the workforce.
 
Procurement and Construction
 
We plan to have a comprehensive procurement program that leverages our size and regional presence to achieve efficiencies and cost savings. Our procurement objective is to maximize cost and process efficiencies to ensure consistent utilization of established contractual arrangements.
Sales and Marketing
 
Our marketing program will be built out utilizing a balanced approach of corporate support and local expertise to attract potential lot buyers or homebuyers in a focused, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our sales and marketing teams will provide a generalized marketing framework across our regional operations. We hope to maintain product and price level differentiation through market and customer research to meet the need of our homebuilders and homebuyers.
 
The central element of our marketing platform is our web presence at www.StratusCapCorp.com. The main purpose of this website is to connect with potential customers.
 
Competition
 
The land development and homebuilding business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous national and local competitors of varying sizes, most of which have greater sales and financial resources than us. We compete primarily on the basis of location, lot availability, product design, quality, service, price and reputation.
 
In order to maximize our sales volumes, profitability and product strategy, we strive to understand our competition and their pricing, product and sales volume strategies and results. Competition among residential land developers and homebuilders of all sizes is based on a number of interrelated factors, including location, lot sizes, reputation, amenities, floor plans, design, quality and price.
 
Seasonality
 
We expect to experience variability in our results on a quarterly basis therefore our results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating requirements. Factors expected to contribute to these fluctuations include, but are not limited to:

• | the timing of the introduction and start of construction of new projects; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the timing of sales;


• | the timing of closings of homes, lots and parcels;


• | the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction; 


• | the condition of the real estate market and general economic conditions in the areas in which we operate; 


• | Joint-venture, partnerships and loan and investment opportunities; 


• | construction timetables;


• | the cost and availability of materials and labor; and 


• | weather conditions in the markets in which we develop and build.

Regulation, Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 
Regulatory
 
We are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular property or locality. In a number of our markets, there has been an increase in state and local legislation requiring the dedication of land as open space. In addition, we are subject to various licensing, registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement and sale of homes in our communities. The impact of these laws has been to increase our overall costs and may delay the opening of communities or cause us to conclude that development of particular communities would not be economically feasible, even if any or all necessary governmental approvals are obtained. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums in one or more of the areas in which we operate, including development of building lots for clients. Generally, such moratoriums relate to insufficient water, power, drainage or sewage facilities or inadequate road capacity.
 
In order to secure certain approvals in some areas, we may be required to provide affordable housing at below market sales prices of residential product or price certain percentage of building lots to meet these requirements. In addition, local and state governments have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects under their jurisdictions, as well as requiring concessions or that the developer or builder construct certain improvements to public places such as parks and streets or fund schools. The impact of these requirements on us depends on how the various state and local governments in the areas in which we engage, or intend to engage, in development implement their programs. To date, these restrictions have not had a material impact on us.
 
We are subject to various state and federal statutes, rules and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules and regulations can increase our homebuyers’ cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, as well as restrict our homebuyers’ access to some types of loans. Certain requirements provided for by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act") have not yet been finalized or fully implemented. The effect of such provisions on our financial services business will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted. The title and settlement services provided by Inspired Title are subject to various regulations, including regulation by state banking and insurance regulators.
 
In order for our homebuyers to finance their home purchases with FHA-insured, Veterans Administration-guaranteed or U.S. Department of Agriculture-guaranteed mortgages, we are required to build such homes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of those agencies.
 
Some states have statutory disclosure requirements or other pre-approval requirements or limitations governing the marketing and sale of new homes. These requirements vary widely from state to state.
 
Some states require us to be registered as a licensed contractor, a licensed real estate broker and in some markets our sales agents are additionally required to be registered as licensed real estate agents.
 
Environmental
 
We also are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of public health and the environment (collectively, “environmental laws”). For example, environmental laws may affect: how we manage storm water runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site. Complying with these environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and/or may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to

remediate, permit revocation, and other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments could result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage, or other losses.
 
As part of the land acquisition due diligence process, we intend to utilize environmental assessments to identify environmental conditions that may exist on potential acquisition properties.
 
We intend to manage compliance with environmental laws at the division level with assistance from the local consultants.
 
Health and Safety
 
We are committed to maintaining high standards in health and safety at all of our sites. Key areas of focus are on site conditions meeting exacting health and safety standards, and on subcontractor performance throughout our operating areas meeting or exceeding expectations.
Intellectual Property
 
We own certain logos and trademarks that are important to our overall branding and sales strategy. Our consumer logos are designed to draw on our recognized homebuilding heritage while emphasizing a customer-centric focus.
Employees, Subcontractors and Consultants
 
As of April 14, 2020, we employ no persons except our officers serve on a part-time basis. Of these, all are engaged in land development, administration and construction operations, senior management facilitate joint-ventures, partnerships or loan investments. As of this date we were not subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
 
We will act as a general contractor at times, or as project manager engaging local general contractors with all construction operations. We will use independent consultants and contractors for land planning, civil engineering, architectural, advertising and legal services.
 
Revenue
 
We did not record any revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 or from December 31, 2019 through the date of this filing. 
 
Investment Company Act 1940
 
Although we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the 1934 Act, we believe we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in business combinations that result in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3a-2 of the 1940 Act.
Factors Effecting Future Performance
 
The factors affecting our future performance are listed and explained below under the section “Risk Factors” below.

Trademarks - We own certain logos and trademarks that are important to our overall branding and sales strategy. Our consumer logos are designed to draw on our recognized homebuilding heritage while emphasizing a customer-centric focus.
Plan of Operations
 
Our plan of operations is to raise debt and/or equity to meet our ongoing operating expenses with opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete this series of transactions. In particular, there is no assurance that any stockholder will realize any return on their shares after such a transaction. Any merger or acquisition completed by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our current stockholders. 
 
Our intended general and administrative budget for the next twelve months is as follows:


 | Q1 financial year ended December 31, 2020 | | Q2 financial year ended December 31, 2020 | Q3 financial year ended December 31, 2020 | | Q4 financial year ended December 31, 2020 | Twelve Month Total

Accounting | $ | 4,000 | | $ | 4,000 | | $ | 4,000 | $ | 4,000 | $ | 16,000 
Legal | | 5,000 | | | 5,000 | | | 5,000 | | 5,000 | | 20,000 
Other fees | | 1,000 | | | 1,000 | | | 1,000 | | 1,000 | | 4,000 
General and administrative | | 1,500 | | | 1,500 | | | 1,500 | | 1,500 | | 6,000 
Miscellaneous | | 500 | | | 500 | | | 500 | | 500 | | 2,000 
Salaries | | 18,000 | | | 18,000 | | | 18,000 | | 18,000 | | 72,000 
Total Operating Expenses | $ | 30,000 | | $ | 30,000 | | $ | 30,000 | $ | 30,000 | $ | 120,000

 
At this time, we have minimal cash on hand and no committed resources of debt or equity to fund these losses and will rely, potentially, on advances from our principal shareholder or our directors and officers. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding from these sources. 
 
The Company may change any or all of the budget categories in the execution of its business model. None of the line items are to be considered fixed or unchangeable. The Company may need substantial additional capital to support its budget. We have not recognized revenues from our planned operational activities.
 
Based on our current cash reserves of approximately $244 as of December 31, 2019, we have the cash for an operational budget of less than one month.  We intend to offer a private placement of shares to investors in order to achieve at least $100,000 in funding in the next year. We intend to commence this offering in late April of 2020. If we are unable to generate enough revenue, to cover our operational costs, we will need to seek additional sources of funds. Currently, we have no committed source for any funds as of the date hereof. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the event funds cannot be raised if and when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan and could fail in business as a result of these uncertainties.
 
The independent registered public accounting firm’s report on our financial statements as of December 31, 2019, includes a “going concern” explanatory paragraph that expresses doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Reports to Securities Holders
 
We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing Form 10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly. In addition, we will file Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (“SEC”), at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549.
