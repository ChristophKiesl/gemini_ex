Overview
We provide quality, cost-effective post-acute health care services to our patients. As of December 31, 2022, we have 920 service providers in 37 states within the continental United States and the District of Columbia. Our services are classified into five segments: (1) home health services, (2) hospice services, (3) home and community-based services, (4) facility-based services, primarily offered through our long-term acute care hospitals ("LTACHs"), and (5) healthcare innovations ("HCI"). 
Our home health service locations offer a wide range of services, including skilled nursing, medically-oriented social services and physical, occupational, and speech therapy. The nurses, home health aides, and therapists in our home health agencies work closely with patients and their families to design and implement individualized treatment plans in accordance with a physician-prescribed plan of care. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 527 home health service locations, of which 320 are wholly-owned by us, 203 are majority-owned by us through equity joint ventures, two are under license lease arrangements, and the operations of the remaining two locations are managed by us.
Our hospices provide end-of-life care to patients with terminal illnesses through interdisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses, home health aides, counselors, and volunteers. We offer a wide range of services, including pain and symptom management, emotional and spiritual support, inpatient and respite care, homemaker services, and counseling. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 159 hospice locations, of which 96 are wholly-owned by us, 61 are majority-owned by us through equity joint ventures, and two are under license lease arrangements. 
Our home and community-based locations offer assistance with activities of daily living to elderly, chronically ill, and disabled patients, performed by skilled nursing and paraprofessional personnel. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 128 locations, of which 119 are wholly-owned by us and 9 are majority-owned by us through equity joint ventures. 
Our LTACH locations provide services primarily to patients with complex medical conditions who have transitioned out of a hospital intensive care unit but whose conditions remain too severe for treatment in a non-acute setting. As of December 31, 2022, our LTACHs had 367 licensed beds. We operated 11 LTACHs with 12 locations, of which all but two are located within host hospitals. As part of our facility-based services segment, we also own and operate two skilled nursing facilities, two rural health clinics, one physician practice, one family health center, and 81 physical therapy clinics. Of these 99 facility-based services locations, 88 are wholly-owned by us and 11 are majority-owned by us through equity joint ventures.
Our HCI segment reports on our developmental activities outside its other business segments. The HCI segment includes (a) Imperium Health Management, LLC, an Accountable Care Organization ("ACO") enablement and management company, (b) Long Term Solutions, Inc., an in-home assessment company serving the long-term care insurance industry, and (c) Advance Care House Calls, which provides primary medical care for patients with chronic and acute illnesses who have difficulty traveling to a doctor's office. These activities are intended ultimately, whether directly or indirectly, to benefit our patients and/or payors through the enhanced provision of services in our other segments. The activities all share a common goal of improving patient experiences and quality outcomes, while lowering costs. They include, but are not limited to, items such as: technology, information, population health management, risk-sharing, care-coordination and transitions, clinical advancements, enhanced patient engagement and informed clinical decision and technology enabled in-home clinical assessments. We have seven HCI locations, of which all are wholly-owned by us.
Our net service revenue by segment for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (amounts in thousands):

 | Year Ended December 31,

Business Strategy
Our objective is to become the leading provider of in-home healthcare services in the United States, while also providing a complementary suite of other post-acute healthcare service offerings through our facility-based and HCI segments. To achieve this objective, we intend to:
Drive internal growth in existing markets.  We intend to drive internal growth in our current markets by increasing the number of (health care) providers from whom we receive referrals and by expanding the breadth of our services in each market. We intend to achieve this growth by: (1) continuing to educate health care providers about the benefits of our services, (2) reinforcing the position of our agencies and facilities as community assets, (3) maintaining our emphasis on high-quality medical care for our patients, (4) identifying related products and services needed by our patients and their communities, and (5) providing a superior work environment for our employees.
Achieve margin improvement through the active management of costs.  Net service revenue generated from Medicare is under the Patient Driven Groupings Model ("PDGM"), which is paid at pre-determined rates based upon the patient's clinical condition. Because our profitability in a fixed payment system depends upon our ability to manage the costs of providing care, we will continue to pursue initiatives to improve our margins and net income. 
Expand into new markets.  We intend to continue expanding into new markets by utilizing our point of care technology, developing de novo locations, and acquiring existing Medicare and/or Medicaid-certified agencies in attractive markets throughout the United States. We will also continue our unique strategy of partnering with hospitals and health systems, as these ventures provide significant return on investment. In addition, we plan to continue acquiring freestanding agencies that can serve as growth platforms in markets we do not currently serve in order to support our growth into new markets.
Pursue strategic acquisitions and develop joint ventures.  We will continue to identify and evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions in new and existing markets that will enhance our market position, increase our referral base, and expand the breadth of services we offer. We will aim to continue entering into joint ventures with hospitals to provide our current post-acute care services to their patients upon discharge from the hospital setting.
Services
We provide post-acute care services in the United States by providing quality, cost-effective health care services to patients within the comfort and privacy of their home, place of residence, or long-term acute care hospital facility. Our services can be broadly classified into five principal segments: (1) home health services, (2) hospice services, (3) home and community-based, (4) facility-based services offered through our LTACHs, and (5) HCI.
Home Health Services
Our registered nurses and licensed practical nurses provide a variety of medically necessary services to homebound patients who are suffering from acute or chronic illness, recovering from injury or surgery, or who otherwise require care, teaching or monitoring. These services include, but are not limited to:
•wound care and dressing changes,
•cardiac rehabilitation,
•infusion therapy,
•pain management,
•pharmaceutical administration,
•skilled observation and assessment, and
•patient education.
We have also designed proprietary clinical pathways to treat chronic diseases and conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease, low vision, spinal stenosis, Parkinson’s disease, osteoporosis, complex wounds, and chronic pain. Through our medical social workers, we counsel patients and their families with regard to financial, personal, and social concerns that arise from a patient’s health-related problems. We provide skilled nursing, ventilator and tracheotomy services, extended care specialties, medication administration and management, and patient and family assistance and education. We also provide management services to third-party home nursing agencies, often as an interim solution until proper state and regulatory approvals for an acquisition can be obtained.
Our physical, occupational, and speech therapists provide therapy services to patients in their home. Our therapists coordinate multi-disciplinary treatment plans with physicians, nurses, and social workers to restore basic mobility skills such as getting out of bed and walking safely with crutches or a walker. As part of the treatment and rehabilitation process, a therapist will stretch and strengthen muscles, test balance and coordination abilities, and teach home exercise programs. Our therapists assist patients and their families with improving and maintaining a patient’s ability to perform functional activities of daily living, such as the ability to dress, cook, clean, and manage other activities safely in the home environment. Our speech and language therapists provide corrective and rehabilitative treatment to patients who suffer from physical or cognitive deficits or disorders that create difficulty with verbal communication or swallowing.
Hospice Services 
Our Medicare-certified hospice operations provide a full range of hospice services designed to meet the individual physical, spiritual, and psychosocial needs of terminally ill patients and their families. Our hospice services are primarily provided in a patient’s home, but can also be provided in a nursing home, assisted living facility, or hospital. The key services provided through our hospice agencies include pain and symptom management accompanied by palliative medication, emotional and spiritual support, inpatient and respite care, homemaker services, dietary counseling, and family bereavement counseling and social worker visits for up to 13 months after a patient’s death.
Home and Community-Based Services
Our home and community-based operations offer a wide range of services to patients in their home or in a medical facility. The services range from assistance with grooming, medication reminders, meal preparation, assistance with feeding, light housekeeping, respite care, transportation, and errand services. 
Facility-Based Services
LTACHs is a reporting unit within our Facility-Based services segment. Our LTACHs treat patients with severe medical conditions who require a high-level of care and frequent monitoring by physicians and other clinical personnel. Patients who receive our services in an LTACH have been diagnosed as being too medically unstable for treatment in a non-acute setting. For example, our LTACHs typically serve patients suffering from respiratory failure, neuromuscular disorders, cardiac disorders, non-healing wounds, renal disorders, cancer, head and neck injuries, and mental disorders. We also treat patients diagnosed with musculoskeletal impairments that restrict their ability to perform normal activities of daily living. We also operate two skilled nursing facilities, family health center, rural health clinics, a physician practice, and physical therapy providers that staff both facilities and outpatient clinics.
Healthcare Innovations Services
Our HCI segment reports on our developmental activities outside our other business segments.  The HCI segment includes (a) Imperium Health Management, LLC, an ACO enablement and management company, (b) Long Term Solutions, Inc., an in-home assessment company serving the long-term care insurance industry, and (c) Advanced Care House Calls, which provides primary medical care for patients with chronic and acute illnesses who have difficulty traveling to a doctor’s office. These activities are intended ultimately, whether directly or indirectly, to benefit our patients and/or payors through the 
enhanced provision of services in our other segments.  The activities all share a common goal of improving patient experiences and quality outcomes, while lowering costs.  They include, but are not limited to, items such as: technology, information, population health management, risk-sharing, care-coordination and transitions, clinical advancements, enhanced patient engagement and informed clinical decision and technology enabled in-home clinical assessments. 
Operations
Financial information relating to the home health, hospice, home and community-based, facility-based, and HCI operating segments of our business, including their contributions to our net service revenue, operating income, and total assets for each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, can be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our home health agencies are operated in one segment that is separated into multiple geographical regions and further separated into individual operating markets or clusters. Our hospice agencies are operated in one segment that is separated into multiple geographical regions. Our home and community-based agencies are operated in one segment separated into multiple geographic regions. Each of our home health and hospice agencies are staffed with experienced clinical home health and administrative professionals who provide a wide range of patient care services. Each of our home health agencies, hospice agencies, and home and community-based agencies are licensed and certified by the state and federal governments. 
Our facility-based service locations are operated in one segment separated into multiple geographic regions. Our facility-based services, through our LTACHs, follow a clinical approach under which each patient is discussed in weekly, multidisciplinary team meetings. In these meetings, patient progress is assessed and compared to goals and future goals are set. We believe that this model results in higher quality care and more predictable discharge patterns and avoids unnecessary delays.
Our home health service locations use our Service Value Point system, a proprietary clinical resource allocation model and cost management system. The system is a quantitative tool that assigns a target level of resource units to a group of patients based upon their initial assessment and estimated skilled nursing and therapy needs. The Service Value Point system allows the Director of Nursing or Branch Manager to allocate adequate resources throughout the group of patients assigned to his or her care to allow for them to provide the highest quality care possible.
Patient care is coordinated on-site at the agency level of each home health service, hospice service, and home and community-based location. All coding, medical records, case management, utilization review, and medical staff credentialing are provided on-site at the hospital level of each facility-based service location. Centralized functions such as payroll, accounting, financial reporting, billing, collections, regulatory and legal compliance, risk management, information technology, and general clinical oversight accomplished by periodic on-site surveys are provided from our home offices.
Our HCI business lines primarily provide assessments and related services to the long-term care insurance industry and management services to ACOs with over 400,000 Medicare lives under management.
Equity Joint Ventures
As of December 31, 2022, we had 82 equity joint ventures including 75 with hospital and health systems, which are comprised of over 350 hospitals, four with physicians, and three with other parties. 
Our equity joint ventures are generally structured as limited liability companies in which we own a majority equity interest and our partner(s) own(s) a minority equity interest. At the time of formation, each party contributes capital to the equity joint venture in the form of cash or property. We believe that the amount contributed by each party to the equity joint venture represents their pro-rata portion of the fair market value of the equity joint venture, and we maintain processes to confirm and document those determinations. None of our equity joint venture partners are required to make or influence referrals to our equity joint ventures. In fact, agreements with our hospital joint venture partners require that they follow the same Medicare discharge planning regulations that, among other things, require the hospitals to offer each Medicare patient a list of available Medicare-certified home nursing agency options and to allow the patient to choose his or her own provider.
We structure our equity joint ventures as either manager-managed or board-managed. We control our manager-managed joint ventures, since LHC Group, Inc. is typically designated as the manager to oversee the day-to-day operations of the joint venture. We control our board-managed joint ventures, since we typically hold a majority of the votes required to take board action and/or we control the senior officer positions, although a majority of our joint ventures require super majority board approval for certain actions. Our equity joint venture partners participate in the profits and losses of the joint venture in proportion to their equity interests. Distributions from our equity joint ventures are made pro-rata based on percentage ownership interests and are not based on referrals made to the equity joint venture by any of the partners.
Most of our equity joint ventures include a buy/sell option that grants to us and our equity joint venture partners the right to require the other party to either purchase all of the exercising member’s membership interests or sell to the exercising 
member all of the non-exercising member’s membership interests, at the non-exercising member’s option, within 30 days of the receipt of notice of the exercise of the buy/sell option. In some instances, the purchase price under these buy/sell provisions is based on a multiple of the historical or future earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization of the equity joint venture at the time the buy/sell option is exercised. In other instances, the buy/sell purchase price will be negotiated by the parties but will be subject to a fair market valuation process.
Competition
The markets supporting post-acute care are highly fragmented. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPac”), an independent agency that advises Congress on various Medicare issues, there were approximately 11,356 Medicare-certified home nursing agencies in the United States in 2019. MedPac estimated that in 2019 approximately 18% of Medicare-certified home health agencies provided a majority of their services in rural areas, and 87% of agencies were proprietary. MedPac also disclosed that 4,840 hospice agencies were participating in the Medicare Program in 2018. We believe we are well positioned to build and maintain long-term relationships with local hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers and to become the highest quality post-acute provider in our markets. In our experience, because most rural areas do not have the population size to support more than one or two general acute care hospitals, the local community hospital often plays a significant role in rural market health care delivery systems. Rural patients who require home nursing frequently receive care from a small home care agency or an agency that, while owned and run by the local community hospital, is not an area of focus for that hospital. Similarly, patients in these markets who require services typically offered by LTACHs are more likely to remain in the community hospital because it is often the only local facility equipped to deal with severe and complex medical conditions. We choose to enter these rural markets through affiliations with local hospitals, since we typically experience significantly less competition for the services we provide.
As we expand into new markets, we may encounter competitors that have greater resources or greater access to capital. Generally, competition in our home health service markets comes from local and regional providers. These providers include facility- and hospital-based providers, visiting nurse associations, and nurse registries. We are unaware of any competitor offering our breadth of services and focusing on the needs of rural markets.
We believe our diverse service offerings, collaborative approach to working with health care providers, concentrated house of brands market strategy, our size as one of the nation's largest home care providers, business experience gained from focusing on rural markets, and patient-oriented operating model provide our principal competitive advantages over local providers.
Quality Assurance & Performance Improvement
The LHC Group Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement Department, overseen by our Vice President of Quality and Care Delivery and Chief Medical Officer, is responsible for formulating quality of care indicators, identifying performance improvement priorities, and facilitating best practices for quality care. Company-wide, we have adopted a “Plan, Do, Check, Act” methodology for our quality/performance improvement activities and initiatives. We also set forth a quality platform that reviews:
•performance improvement audits,
•state and regulatory surveys,
•publicly reported quality data, and
•patient perception of care.
The Quality Department is also responsible for ensuring that the infrastructure of the quality initiatives throughout the Company is appropriate, overseeing and evaluating the effectiveness of the quality plans and initiatives, and recommending appropriate quality and performance improvement initiatives.
The Clinical Quality Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for advising our clinical leadership, monitoring the performance of our locations based on internal and external benchmarks, overseeing and evaluating the effectiveness of the performance improvement and quality plans, facilitating best practices based on internal and external comparisons, and fostering enhanced awareness of clinical performance by the Board of Directors.
As part of our ongoing quality control, internal auditing, and monitoring programs, we conduct internal regulatory audits and mock surveys at each of our agencies and facilities at least once a year. If an agency or facility does not achieve a satisfactory rating, we require that it prepare and implement a plan of correction. We then follow-up to verify that all deficiencies identified in the initial audit and survey have been corrected.
As required under the Medicare conditions of participation, we maintain a continuous quality improvement program, which involves:
•ongoing education of staff and quarterly continuous quality improvement meetings at each of our agencies, facilities, and principal home offices,
•monthly comprehensive audits of patient charts performed at each of our agencies and facilities,
•a comprehensive survey readiness assessment on each of our agencies and facilities, annually at a minimum,
•review of Home Health Compare scores,
•employee benchmarking software to track real time patient quality of care
•assessment of patients' and/or family members' perception of care using third party data, and
•assessment of infection control practices and risk events.
We constantly expand and refine our continuous quality improvement programs. Specific written policies, procedures, training, and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities, have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business. Our programs also address specific areas identified for improvement through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities. We believe our consistent focus on continuous quality improvement programs provide us with a competitive advantage in the markets we serve.
With the January 2023 Home Health Compare update, 90% of our providers were 4 Stars or above for the quality of care rating and 64% of our providers are at or above 4 stars for the HHCAPS (Home Health Care Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) star rating.
Compliance 
We have established and continually maintain a comprehensive compliance and ethics program that is designed to assist all of our employees to exceed applicable standards established by federal and state laws and regulations and industry practice. Our goal is to foster and maintain the highest standards of compliance, ethics, integrity, and professionalism in every aspect of our business dealings, and we utilize our compliance and ethics program to assist our employees toward achieving that goal.
The purpose of our compliance and ethics program is to promote and foster compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government healthcare programs, industry standards, our Code of Conduct and Ethics, and our other policies and procedures that support and enhance overall compliance within our Company. Our compliance and ethics program focuses on regulations related to the federal False Claims Act, the Stark Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Law, billing and overall adherence to health care regulations.
To ensure the independence of our compliance department staff, we have implemented the following:
•our Chief Compliance Officer reports to and has direct oversight by the Audit Committee and Quality Committee of the Board of Directors,
•our compliance department has its own operating budget, and
•our compliance department has the authority to independently investigate any compliance or ethical concerns, including, when deemed necessary, the authority to interview any company personnel, access any company property, including electronic communications, and engage counsel to assist in any investigation.
Among other activities, our compliance department staff is responsible for the following activities:
•drafting and revising the Company’s policies and procedures related to compliance and ethics issues,
•reviewing, making recommended revisions, disseminating and tracking attestations to our Code of Conduct and Ethics,
•measuring compliance with our policies and procedures, Code of Conduct and Ethics and legal and regulatory requirements related to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government healthcare programs, laws and regulations,
•developing and providing compliance-related training and education to all of our employees and, as appropriate, directors, contractors and other representatives and agents, including new-hire compliance training for all new employees, annual compliance training for all employees, sales compliance training to all members of our sales team, billing compliance training to all members of our billing and revenue cycle team and other job-specific and role-based compliance training of certain employees,
•performing a bi-annual company-wide risk assessment, with ongoing review and revision,
•implementing an annual compliance auditing and monitoring work plan and performing and following up on various risk-based auditing and monitoring activities, including both clinical and non-clinical auditing and monitoring activities at the corporate level and at the local agency/facility level,
•developing, implementing and overseeing our Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) privacy and security compliance program,
•monitoring, responding to and overseeing the resolution of issues and concerns raised through our anonymous compliance hotline,
•monitoring, responding to and resolving all compliance and ethics-related issues and concerns raised through any other form of communication, and
•ensuring that we take appropriate corrective and disciplinary action when noncompliant or improper conduct is identified.
All employees are required to report incidents, issues or other concerns that they believe in good faith may be in violation of our Code of Conduct and Ethics, our policies and procedures, applicable legal and regulatory requirements or the requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government health care programs. All employees are encouraged to either contact our Chief Compliance Officer directly or to contact our 24-hour toll-free or web-based compliance hotline when they have questions or concerns about any compliance or ethics issues. All reports to our compliance hotline are kept confidential to the extent allowed by law, and employees have the option to remain anonymous. When cases reported to our compliance hotline involve a compliance or ethics issue or any possible violation of law or regulation, the matter is referred to the compliance department for investigation. Retaliation against employees in connection with reporting compliance or ethical concerns is considered a serious violation of our Code of Conduct and Ethics, and, if it occurs, will result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
We continually expand and refine our compliance and ethics programs. We promote a culture of compliance, ethics, integrity and professionalism within the Company through persistent messages from our senior leadership concerning the necessity of strict compliance with legal requirements and company policies and procedures. We believe our consistent focus on our compliance and ethics program provides us with a competitive advantage in the markets we serve.
Technology and Intellectual Property 
Technology plays a key role in the day-to-day operation of our business, our ability to grow our business organically and through acquisitions, and in maintaining effective managerial oversight and controls. The technology solutions we use are highly scalable. We believe that our ability to implement, maintain, and leverage our technology solutions provides us with a competitive advantage that allows us to grow our business in a cost-efficient manner and provide better patient care.
Our Service Value Point system is a proprietary information system that assists us in, among other things, monitoring clinical utilization and other cost factors, supporting our health care management techniques, internal benchmarking, clinical analysis, outcomes monitoring and claims generation, revenue cycle management, and revenue reporting at our home nursing agencies. We were issued a patent for our Service Value Point system during 2009 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This proprietary home nursing clinical resource and cost management system is a quantitative tool that assigns a target level of resource units to each patient based upon our staff's initial assessment of the patient's estimated skilled nursing and therapy needs. We designed this system to empower our direct care employees to make appropriate day-to-day clinical care decisions while also allowing us to monitor and manage the quality and delivery of care across our system, including the cost of providing that care, on both a patient-specific and agency-specific basis. In 2019, we updated our Service Value Point system for the new PDGM payment system adopted by CMS and other payors.
All of our home nursing and hospice locations utilize our point of care ("POC") system. Our POC system allows a visiting clinician to access records and other information from the patient’s home or at the POC, complete required documentation at the POC and submit it electronically into our patient record system. HomeCare HomeBase is our solution of choice for home health and hospice operations. Currently, all of our home health and hospice locations are using HomeCare HomeBase. All of our home and community-based locations are using Continulink. Our advance practice services utilize eMD’s Aprima solution and our long-term acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facility services utilize WellSky’s HCS solution.
Each of these applications support their respective lines of business and locations with administrative, office, clinical, and operating information system needs, including assisting with the compliance of our operating systems with HIPAA requirements. Each application also assists our staff in gathering information to improve the quality of patient care, optimizing financial performance, promoting regulatory compliance, and enhancing staff efficiency. Each application (with the exception of WellSky’s HCS solution) is hosted by the vendor in a secure data center, with multiple redundancies for storage, power, bandwidth, and security. WellSky’s HCS solution is hosted at a co-located data center that is managed by the Company.
We have built an enterprise data warehouse that aggregates data from our ERP solution, and various health record/billing systems in use. We use various third-party solutions and several LHC-developed applications to provide historical, current, and forward-looking operational performance analysis. Our dashboards and reports provide high-level and detailed, historical and current, views to measure performance against budget and deliver insights into factors that drive our execution against our financial, operational, and compliance goals. These dashboards and reports are available in summary and detailed views to accommodate user needs from senior management down to the operators in the field.
We utilize a variety of third-party solutions for human resource management and use their services and products to manage our payroll processing, leave of absence (“LOA”) processes, flexible spending account (“FSA”) administration, time, and attendance. We also utilize third-party solutions for financial management, including budgeting, forecasting, and financial reporting, including but not limited to general ledger, accounts payable, and fixed assets.
We are also deploying solutions across all of our home health, hospice, and home and community-based locations to comply with the requirements for electronic visit verification (“EVV”). In order to comply with current and future state and federal regulations for EVV, we utilize several different solutions. In states with an “open” model, we are able to choose our EVV vendor, and we use Continulink, or HomeCare HomeBase (in partnership with CellTrak) as our preferred EVV solution provider. In “closed” systems where states mandate the EVV vendor, we utilize the state-mandated EVV solution provider. In all cases, we have built interfaces between the EVV solution providers and our electronic health record and billing systems.
Reimbursement 
The following describes the payment models in effect during the year ended December 31, 2022. Such payment models have been subject to temporary adjustments made by CMS in response COVID-19 pandemic as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Medicare
The federal government’s Medicare program, governed by the Social Security Act of 1965 (the “Social Security Act”), reimburses health care providers for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. These beneficiaries generally include persons age 65 and older and those who are chronically disabled. The program is primarily administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and CMS. Medicare services accounted for 59.6%, 59.8% and 62.1%, of our net service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Medicare reimburses us based upon the setting in which we provide our services or the Medicare category in which those services fall.
In 2011, sequestration was implemented in the Budget Control Act of 2011(BCA, P.L. 112-25) as a tool in federal budget control. The sequestration cut to Medicare payments began on April 1, 2013, and reduced Medicare payments for patients whose service dates ended on or after April 1, 2013 by 2%. In response to COVID-19, the U.S. Government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES Act") on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act suspended the 2% sequestration payment adjustments on Medicare patient claims with periods that ended on May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. On April 14, 2021, Congress passed legislation to continue the suspension of the 2% sequestration payment adjustments on Medicare patient claims with dates of service through December 31, 2021. On December 10, 2021, the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act legislation passed, which will continue the suspension of the sequestration payment adjustments for Medicare patient claims with dates of service through March 31, 2022. Medicare patient claims with dates of services between April 1 through June 30, 2022 had a 1% sequestration adjustment and Medicare patient claims with dates of services beginning July 1, 2022 returned to a 2% sequestration adjustment.

The Medicare home nursing benefit is available to patients who need care following discharge from a hospital, as well as patients who suffer from chronic conditions that require skilled intermittent care. While the services received need not be rehabilitative or of a finite duration, patients who require full-time skilled nursing for an extended period of time generally do not qualify for Medicare home nursing benefits. As a condition of coverage under Medicare, beneficiaries must: (1) be homebound, meaning they are unable to leave their home without a considerable and taxing effort; (2) require intermittent skilled nursing, physical therapy, or speech therapy services that are covered by Medicare; and (3) receive treatment under a plan of care that is established and periodically reviewed by a physician. Qualifying patients also may receive reimbursement for occupational therapy, medical social services, and home health aide services if these additional services are part of a plan of care prescribed by a physician.
We record revenue as services are provided under PDGM. For each 30-day period, the patient is classified into one of 432 home health resource groups prior to receiving services. Each 30-day period is placed into a subgroup falling under the following categories: (i) timing being early or late, (ii) admission source being community or institutional, (iii) one of 12 clinical groupings based on the patient's principal diagnosis, (iv) functional impairment level of low, medium, or high, and (v) a co-morbidity adjustment of none, low, or high based on the patient's secondary diagnoses. 
Each 30-day period payment from Medicare reflects base payment adjustments for case-mix and geographic wage differences. In addition, payments may reflect one of three retroactive adjustments to the total reimbursement: (a) an outlier payment if the patient’s care was unusually costly; (b) a low utilization adjustment whereby the number of visits is dependent on the clinical grouping; and/or (c) a partial payment if the patient transferred to another provider or from another provider before completing the episode. The retroactive adjustments outlined above are recognized in net service revenue when the event causing the adjustment occurs and during the period in which the services are provided to the patient. We review these adjustments to ensure that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the retroactive adjustments is subsequently resolved. Net service revenue and related patient accounts receivable are recorded at amounts estimated to be realized from Medicare for services rendered. 
Under PDGM, the initial certification of Medicare patient eligibility, plan of care, and comprehensive assessment remains valid for 60-day episodes of care but payments for Medicare home health services are made based upon 30-day payment periods. The national, standardized 30-day Medicare payment amount was $2,031.64, resulting in a 3.2% increase in payments over fiscal year 2021. The rule reflected the 2.6% payment update, 0.7% increase due to the reduction of the fixed-dollar loss ratio for outliers, and a 0.1% reduction due to the rural add-on percentages mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The final rule expanded the Home Health Value-Based Purchasing ("HHVBP") model nationally, with the first performance year of January 1, 2023. Starting in 2025, fee-for-service payments to home health agencies will be adjusted based on the quality of care provided to beneficiaries during the calendar year 2023 performance year. 
On October 31, 2022, CMS released the final rule for fiscal year 2023. The final rule states the Medicare base payments will increase by 0.7%. The increase reflects the effects of the 4.0% home health payment update, a 3.5% decrease from the effects of the prospective permanent behavioral assumption adjustment of -3.925% that is being phased-in, and 0.2% increase from the effects of an update to the fixed-dollar ratio used in determining outlier payments. The impact of the -3.925% permanent behavioral assumption adjustment is -3.5%, as the permanent adjustment is only made to the 30-day payment rate and not the Low Utilization Payment Adjustment per visit payment rates. CMS also finalized a permanent 5% cap on negative wage index changes regardless of the underlying reason for the decrease.
We verify a patient’s eligibility for home health benefits at the time of admission. 
Home health payment rates are updated annually by the home health market basket percentage as adjusted by Congress. CMS establishes the home health market basket index, which measures inflation in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services included in home health services.
Hospice
In order for a Medicare beneficiary to qualify for the Medicare hospice benefit, two physicians must certify that, in their clinical judgment, the beneficiary has less than six months to live, assuming the beneficiary’s disease runs its normal course. In addition, the Medicare beneficiary must affirmatively elect hospice care and waive any rights to other Medicare curative benefits related to his or her terminal illness. At the end of each benefit period (described below), a physician must recertify that the Medicare beneficiary’s life expectancy is six months or less in order for the beneficiary to continue to qualify for and to receive the Medicare hospice benefit. The first two benefit periods are 90 days and subsequent benefit periods are 60 days. A Medicare beneficiary may revoke his or her election at any time and resume receiving traditional Medicare benefits. There is no limit on how long a Medicare beneficiary can receive hospice benefits and services, provided that the beneficiary continues to meet Medicare hospice eligibility criteria.
Medicare reimburses for hospice care using one of four predetermined daily rates based upon the level of care we furnish to a beneficiary. These rates are subject to annual adjustments based on inflation and geographic wage considerations. The base Medicare rate for services that we provide to a beneficiary depends upon which of the following four levels of care we provide to that beneficiary:
•Routine Care. Care that is not classified under any of the other levels of care, such as the work of nurses, social workers or home health aides.
•General Inpatient Care. Pain control or acute or chronic symptom management that cannot be managed in a setting other than an inpatient Medicare certified facility, such as a hospital, skilled nursing facility or hospice inpatient facility.
•Continuous Home Care. Care for patients experiencing a medical crisis that requires nursing services to achieve palliation and symptom control, if the agency provides a minimum of eight hours of care within a 24-hour period.
•Respite Care. Short-term, inpatient care to give temporary relief to the caregiver who regularly provides care to the patient.
Medicare limits the reimbursement we may receive for inpatient care services (both respite and general care) for hospice patients. Under the “80-20 rule,” if the number of inpatient care days of hospice care furnished by us to Medicare hospice beneficiaries under a unique provider number exceeds 20% of the total days of hospice care furnished by us to all Medicare hospice beneficiaries for both inpatient and in-home care, Medicare payments to us for inpatient care days exceeding the inpatient cap will be reduced to the routine home care rate, with excess amounts due back to Medicare. This determination is made annually based on the twelve-month period beginning on October 1 each year. Our Medicare hospice reimbursement is also subject to a cap amount calculated at the end of the hospice cap period, based on the twelve-month period beginning on October 1 each year, which determines the maximum allowable payments per provider. 
On July 29, 2021, CMS released the final rule for fiscal year 2022. The final hospice payment update was a 2.0% increase of payment rates, which applied a 2.7% market basket update and a 0.7% decrease for productivity. The final rule also increased the aggregate cap value of $31,297.61 for fiscal year 2022. 
On July 27, 2022, CMS released the final rule for fiscal year 2023 to update payment rates and the wage index. The final hospice payment update is an increase of 3.8%, which applies a 4.1% market basket update and a 0.3 percentage point reduction for productivity. Hospice agencies that fail to meet quality reporting requirements will receive a two percentage point reduction to the annual market basket update. The final rule increased the aggregate cap value of $32,486.92, as compared to $31,297.61 for the fiscal year 2022. 
Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals 
All Medicare payments to our LTACHs are made in accordance with a PPS specifically applicable to LTACHs, referred to as “LTACH-PPS.” The LTACH-PPS was established by CMS final regulations published in 2002, that require each patient discharged from an LTACH to be assigned a distinct long-term care diagnosis-related group (“MS-LTC-DRG”), which take into account (among other things) the severity of a patient's condition. Our LTACHs are paid a predetermined fixed amount based upon the assigned MS-LTC-DRG (adjusted for area wage differences), which includes adjustments for short stay and high cost outlier patients (described in further detail below). The payment amount for each MS-LTC-DRG classification is intended to reflect the average cost of treating a Medicare patient assigned to that MS-LTC-DRG in an LTACH.
Adjustments to MS-LTC-DRG payments might include:
•Short Stay Outlier Policy. CMS has established a modified payment methodology for Medicare patients with a length-of-stay less than or equal to five-sixths of the geometric average length-of-stay for that particular MS-LTC-DRG, referred to as a short stay outlier, or “SSO.” When LTACH-PPS was established, SSO cases were paid based on the lesser of (1) 120% of the average cost of the case; (2) 120% of the LTC-DRG specific per diem amount multiplied by the patient’s length-of-stay; or (3) the full LTC-DRG payment. CMS modified the payment methodology for discharges occurring on or after July 1, 2006, which changed the limitation in clause (1) above to reduce payment for SSO cases to 100% (rather than 120%) of the average cost of the case, and also added a fourth limitation, potentially further limiting payment for SSO cases at a per diem rate derived from blending 120% of the MS-LTC-DRG specific per diem amount with a per diem rate based on the general acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system, or “IPPS”. Under this methodology, as a patient’s length-of-stay increases, the percentage of the per diem amount based upon the IPPS component will decrease and the percentage based on the MS-LTC-DRG component will increase.
•High Cost Outliers. Some cases are extraordinarily costly, producing losses that may be too large for healthcare providers to offset. Cases with unusually high costs, referred to as “high cost outliers,” receive a payment adjustment to reflect the additional resources utilized. CMS provides an additional payment if the estimated costs for the patient exceed the adjusted MS-LTC-DRG payment plus a fixed-loss amount that is established in the annual payment rate update.
•Interrupted Stays. An interrupted stay occurs when an LTACH patient is admitted upon discharge to a general acute care hospital, inpatient rehab facility, skilled nursing facility or a swing-bed hospital and returns to the same LTACH within a specified period of time. If the length-of-stay at the receiving provider is equal to or less than the applicable fixed period of time, it is considered to be an interrupted stay case and is treated as a single discharge for the purposes of payment to the LTACH.
Freestanding, HwH and Satellite LTACHs
LTACHs may be organized and operated as freestanding facilities or as a hospital within a hospital, or “HwH”. A HwH is an LTACH that is located on the "campus" of another hospital, meaning the physical area immediately adjacent to a hospital’s main buildings, other areas and structures that are not strictly contiguous to a hospital’s main buildings but are located within 250 yards of its main buildings, and any other area determined, on an individual case basis by the applicable CMS regional office, to be part of a hospital's campus. An LTACH that uses the same Medicare provider number of an affiliated “primary site” LTACH is known as a “satellite”. Under Medicare policy, a satellite LTACH must be located within 35 miles of its primary site LTACH and be administered by such primary site LTACH. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 12 LTACH facilities, with 367 licensed beds. Ten of our LTACH facilities were classified as HwHs and two were classified as freestanding. Of the 12 facilities, eight were located in Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”) or urban areas and four were located in non-MSA or rural areas. One of our HwH facilities was a satellite location of a parent hospital located in an MSA. Both of our freestanding locations are in MSAs, with one being located adjacent to a tertiary care facility.
An LTACH must have an average inpatient length-of-stay for Medicare patients (including both Medicare covered and non-covered days) of greater than 25 days during each annual cost reporting period. LTACHs that fail to exceed an average length-of-stay of 25 days during any cost reporting period may be paid under the general acute care hospital IPPS. 
Fiscal Year Rates 
On August 2, 2021, CMS issued a final rule for the fiscal year 2022. LTACH-PPS payments increased by 1.1% for fiscal year 2022. LTACH-PPS payments for fiscal year 2022 for discharges paid using the standard LTACH payment rate increased by 0.9% due primarily to the annual standard Federal rate update for fiscal year 2022 of 1.9% and 0.8% decrease in high cost outlier payments. LTACH-PPS payments for fiscal year 2022 for discharges paid using the site neutral payment rate increased by 3%. 
On August 1, 2022, CMS issued the final rule for the fiscal year 2023 stating LTACH-PPS payments will increase 2.3% due primarily to the annual standard federal rate update (the productivity-adjusted market basket increase) of 3.8% and a decrease in high cost outlier payments. 
In response to COVID-19, the CARES Act suspended the application of site-neutral payments for LTACH admissions that were admitted during the Public Health Emergency ("PHE"). On February 9, 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services extended the PHE until May 11, 2023. 
Medicaid 
Medicaid is a joint federal and state funded health insurance program for certain low-income individuals administered by the states. Medicaid reimburses health care providers using a number of different systems, including cost-based, prospective payment and negotiated rate systems. Rates are also subject to adjustment based on statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, government funding limitations and interpretations of policy by individual state agencies.
Non-Governmental Payors
Payments from non-governmental payor sources are based on episodic-based rates or per visit based rates depending upon the terms and conditions of the payor. This reimbursement category includes payors such as insurance companies, workers’ compensation programs, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, other managed care companies and employers, as well as payments received directly from patients.
Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary charges for our services and amounts paid by Medicare and Medicaid programs and the non-governmental payors, but are responsible for services not covered by these programs or plans, as well as co-payments for deductibles and co-insurance obligations of their coverage. Patient out-of-pocket costs for the payment of deductibles and co-insurance have increased in recent years. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from government or business payors. Because the majority of our billed services are paid in full by Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance, co-payments from patients do not represent a material portion of our billed revenue and corresponding accounts receivable. To further reduce their health care costs, most commercial payors such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and other managed care companies have negotiated discounted fee structures or fixed amounts for services performed, rather than paying health care providers the amounts normally billed.
In response to the challenges associated with collecting from commercial payors, we began negotiating higher reimbursement rates with a majority of our commercial payors. As of December 31, 2022, our managed care contracts included over 325 different payors between all of our divisions. If we are unable to continue negotiating higher reimbursement rates with commercial payors, if commercial payor continues to outpace traditional governmental payor growth, or if commercial payors reduce health care costs through reduction in home health reimbursement, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
Human Capital Resources
Our culture and values, along with approximately 30,000 employees in 37 states and the District of Columbia, are our most valuable assets. In pursuit of our Company’s purpose - It’s All About Helping People - we strive to provide exceptional care and unparalleled service to patients and families who have placed their trust in us. We are led in this pursuit by our operating philosophy, rooted in the principles of service excellence, and our actions are guided by our Six Pillars of Excellence:
People: Ours is a business of people helping people.
Service: We are here to serve patients, families and communities.
Quality: In all we do, our focus is quality above all else.
Efficiency: We operate with discipline and efficiency to remain strong.
Growth: It is our obligation to care for as many as we can.
Ethics: We conduct ourselves with the highest standards of ethics, integrity and professionalism.
In order to ensure we live our values and our culture stays unique and strong, our Board of Directors and executive team have committed substantial efforts to focus on our human capital resources. These are some of the key aspects of our human capital strategy:
Employee Recruitment & Retention
We work diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our businesses. We have established relationships with over 350 hospitals and hospital systems, world-class universities, trade schools, professional associations, and industry groups to proactively attract talent.
We provide a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique culture, collaborative working environment, shared sense of purpose, and desire to do the right thing to attract talent to our Company. 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 30,000 employees, which includes 13,900 in our home health operations, 3,500 in our hospice operations, 7,500 in our home and community-based services operations, and 1,000 in our LTACHs.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We aspire to be a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace, where people feel empowered and free to make the most of their talents. As we invest in our employees, diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DE&I") are major priorities. Women make up more than 87% of our workforce, and approximately 36% identify as a minority. Our senior management team is 62% women, and approximately 20% identify as a minority. In addition, our Board of Directors is 22% women and 11% minority, and women serve as the chairs of our Nominating and Governance Committee and Audit Committee. 
The success of our Company has been, and will continue to be, highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a culture where we value, respect, and provide fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees. By recognizing and celebrating our differences, we cultivate an environment that welcomes a diverse group of talented individuals. 
In the interest of furthering these goals, the Company established the role of Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer in 2021. This individual serves as the chair for our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, which was established in 2020 to formulate and implement actionable diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives for the Company in pursuit of our DE&I objectives:
•Provide opportunities to increase DE&I awareness and education.
•Increase diversity through hiring, retention, and promotion of employees.
•Demonstrate commitment to a diverse, inclusive work environment.
•Identify and reduce barriers impeding the employment, opportunity, or inclusion of individuals.
Compensation Programs and Employee Benefits
The main objective of our compensation and benefits programs is to provide a compensation and benefits package that will attract, retain, motivate, and reward employees who succeed in operating in a highly competitive and challenging environment. We seek to do this by linking annual changes in compensation to our overall performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on our overall performance is intended to align the employee’s interests with the provision of quality patient care and our success. We also seek fairness in total compensation that is competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, knowledge, and geographic locations with reference to external comparisons, internal comparisons, and the relationship between management and non-management remuneration.
We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of our wide-ranging benefits offered are: medical insurance, participation in our 401 (k) plan, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, and identity theft insurance.
Training and Education
All new employees and contractors, and all existing employees and contractors on an annual basis, must complete a one-hour program on our corporate compliance and ethics program. We also require annual distribution of the Code of Conduct and Ethics, and require each employee, including contractors, to acknowledge their receipt, review, and attestation to abide by the terms of the Code.
To empower employees to unleash their potential, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources that our employees need and desire to be successful. For example, our iTrain platform provides additional specialized training in areas such as eligibility for home health and hospice, HIPAA, privacy, and security, clinical and quality, coding, billing and reimbursement, and sales and marketing through webcasts, online courses and instructor-led sessions. Additionally, our Excellence by Design program provides a robust and formal curriculum for employees to obtain a deeper understanding of all facets of the Company, including accounting and finance, employee recruitment and retention, 
regulatory and licensure compliance, and supervisory management training, to support the development of the next generation of our management and leaders. Participants in our training programs are able to develop more advanced skills leading to higher contribution and satisfaction within their roles, while helping us to identify top performers, improve employee performance and retention, increase our organizational learning, and support the promotion of our current employees within our Company.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, a total of 42,462 employees and contract workers received education and training through company-provided programs, with an average of 30 courses being completed by each participant with an average of 21 training hours.
We also maintain a full suite of compliance policies and procedures. We perform a routine review and revision of our policies and procedures to stay abreast of both internal and external developments. All employees receive updated policies and procedures for review, specifically those that are directly related to job function. Our compliance policies include a Code of Conduct related to sales, marketing, education, and entertainment activities with referral sources. These policies establish rules and procedures governing our employees’ interactions with current and potential referral sources as well as those with the ability to influence or recommend a referral to one of our providers, helping ensure current regulations and laws are followed.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Our values, rooted in trust, integrity, and service, lay the foundation for our commitment to corporate social responsibility. Beyond providing quality healthcare to some of the most vulnerable members of our society, we believe that to be truly successful, it's crucial that we do our part to improve healthcare in the United States. For us, that means we are contributing our time, talent, and resources to strengthen the communities where we do business, and we are engaging in ethical practices. We are committed to the principle that when our local communities thrive, we succeed.
Across the country, our agencies and employees contribute to worthy causes both locally and nationally, including United Way, Boys & Girls Clubs, Toys for Tots, and the American Heart Association, among countless other worthy social organizations. In 2022, we made approximately $2.0 million in charitable contributions. From a national perspective, we are proud to be among a handful of global companies and brands that sponsor the American Red Cross at its highest sponsorship level – the Annual Disaster Giving Program, including monetary donations, volunteering, sponsorships, regular shared communications, shared trainings, and co-branded initiatives.
Compliance and Business Ethics
We are firmly committed to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, professionalism, and compliance. Our compliance and ethics program includes auditing and monitoring, enhanced lines of communication between the Chief Compliance Officer and employees, consistency in the standards we set for ethics, and compliance and increased awareness of these standards through a robust training and education program. We also operate an independent third-party “Integrity Line” that encourages employees to report any concerns about unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, harassment, discrimination, abuse, or workplace safety violations.
Our code of conduct and ethics provides guidance to all of our employees, contractors and board members on carrying out daily activities within appropriate ethical and legal standards. The code of conduct and ethics was developed to help ensure we meet our ethical standards and comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations. It is a critical component of our overall compliance and ethics program and is an important resource — especially in situations where questions may arise about determining the right thing to do.
Safety, Health, & Wellness
The health and safety of our clinicians and other employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. We continue to undertake numerous tangible measures to promote the safety of our clinicians and other employees. For example, we continue to provide our clinicians across the country with personal protective equipment and other supplies needed to properly treat our patients based on the patient's clinical diagnosis. In addition to offering health insurance benefits options to all full-time employees, we also offer numerous other health and wellness benefit options including dental insurance, optical insurance, company-paid time off, company-paid holidays, tuition reimbursement, an employee hardship financial-assistance program, employee discount programs for health and wellness service memberships, company-paid short term disability insurance, and preferred rates on life, disability, and other insurance programs.
Government Regulations 
General
The health care industry is highly regulated and we are required to comply with federal, state and local laws which significantly affect our business. These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation. Regulations and policies frequently change, and 
we monitor these changes through trade and governmental publications and associations. The significant areas of federal and state regulation that could affect our ability to conduct our business include the following:
•Medicare and Medicaid participation and reimbursement regulations;
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws;
•the federal Stark Law and similar state laws;
•false claims laws and regulations;
•HIPAA;
•laws and regulations imposing civil monetary penalties;
•environmental health and safety laws;
•licensing laws and regulations; and
•laws and regulations governing certificates of need and permits of approval. 
If we fail to comply with these applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, these are complex matters and a review of our practices by a court or law enforcement or regulatory authority could result in an adverse determination that could harm our business. Furthermore, the laws applicable to us are subject to change, interpretation, and amendment; which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.
Medicare Participation
To participate in the Medicare program and receive Medicare payments, our agencies and facilities must comply with regulations promulgated by CMS. Among other things, these requirements, known as “conditions of participation,” relate to the type of facility, its personnel, and its standards of medical care. While we intend to continue to participate in the Medicare reimbursement programs, we cannot guarantee that our agencies, facilities, and programs will continue to qualify for Medicare participation.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
Certain provisions of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit the payment or receipt of anything of value in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease, or order of items or services that are covered by a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony and sanctions include imprisonment of up to five years, criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 per act plus three times the amount claimed or three times the remuneration offered and exclusion from federal health care programs (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs). Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against payments intended to induce referrals of Medicaid and other third-party payor patients.
The OIG has published numerous “safe harbors” that exempt some practices from enforcement action under the Anti-Kickback Statute. These safe harbors exempt specified activities, including bona-fide employment relationships, contracts for the rental of space or equipment, personal service arrangements, and management contracts, so long as all of the requirements of the safe harbor are met. The OIG has recognized that the failure of an arrangement to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, each arrangement is analyzed on a case-by-case basis, which is very fact specific. While we operate our business to comply with the prohibitions of the Anti-Kickback Statute, we cannot guarantee that all our arrangements will satisfy a safe harbor or will ultimately be viewed as being compliant with the Anti-Kickback Statute.
We endeavor to conduct our operations in compliance with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. However, our practices may be challenged in the future and the fraud and abuse laws may be interpreted in a way that finds us in violation of these laws. If we are found to be in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, and we could be excluded from participating in federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial condition and results of operations.
Stark Law
Congress has passed significant prohibitions against physician self-referrals of patients for certain designated health care services, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits a physician from making referrals for particular health care services (called designated health services) to entities with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship.
The term “financial relationship” is defined very broadly to include most types of ownership or compensation relationships. The Stark Law defines a financial relationship to include: (1) a physician’s ownership or investment interest in an entity and (2) a compensation relationship between a physician and an entity. Under the Stark Law, financial relationships include both direct and indirect relationships. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from seeking payment under the Medicare or Medicaid programs for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. If an entity is paid for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral, it may incur civil penalties and could be excluded from participating in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. If an arrangement is covered by the Stark Law, the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met for the physician to be able to make referrals to the entity for designated health services and for the entity to be able to bill for these services.
“Designated health services” under the Stark Law is defined to include home health services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services, physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, radiology services (including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scans and ultrasound services), radiation therapy services and supplies, and the provision of durable medical equipment and supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment and supplies, prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies, and outpatient prescription drugs. 
Physicians refer patients to us for several Stark Law designated health services, including home health services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physical therapy services. We have compensation arrangements with some of these physicians or their professional practices in the form of medical director and consulting agreements. We also have operations owned by joint ventures in which physicians have an investment interest. In addition, other physicians who refer patients to our agencies and facilities may own shares of our stock. As a result of these relationships, we could be deemed to have a financial relationship with physicians who refer patients to our facilities and agencies for designated health services. If so, the Stark Law would prohibit the physicians from making those referrals and would prohibit us from billing for the services unless a Stark Law exception applies.
The Stark Law contains exceptions for certain physician ownership or investment interests and physician compensation arrangements. If an investment relationship or compensation agreement between a physician, or a physician’s immediate family member, and the subject entity satisfies all requirements for a Stark Law exception, the Stark Law will not prohibit the physician from referring patients to the entity for designated health services. The exceptions for a physician investment relationship include ownership in an entire hospital and ownership in rural providers. The exceptions for compensation arrangements cover employment relationships, personal services contracts and space and equipment leases, among others. We believe our physician investment relationships and compensation arrangements with referring physicians meet the requirements as exceptions under the Stark Law and that our operations comply with the Stark Law.
The Stark Law also includes an exception for a physician’s ownership or investment interest in certain entities through the ownership of stock that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. If the ownership meets certain other requirements, the Stark Law will not apply to prohibit the physician from referring to the entity for designated health services. For example, this Stark Law exception requires that the entity issuing the stock have at least $75.0 million in stockholders’ equity at the end of its most recent fiscal year or on average during the previous three fiscal years. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we have in excess of $75.0 million in stockholders’ equity.
If an entity violates the Stark Law, it could be subject to civil penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited claim and up to $100,000 for knowingly entering into certain prohibited referral schemes. The entity also may be excluded from participating in federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). There are no criminal penalties for violations of Stark Law. If the Stark Law was found to apply to our relationships with referring physicians and those relationships did not meet the requirement of an exception under the Stark Law, we would be required to restructure these relationships or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from these physicians. If we were found to have submitted claims to Medicare or Medicaid for services provided pursuant to a referral prohibited by the Stark Law, we would be required to repay any amounts we received from Medicare for those services and could be subject to civil monetary penalties. Further, we could be excluded from participating in Medicare and Medicaid. If we were required to repay any amounts to Medicare, subjected to fines, or excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, our business and financial condition would be harmed significantly.
Many states have physician relationship and referral statutes that are similar to the Stark Law. Some of these laws generally apply without regard to whether the payor is a governmental body (such as Medicare) or a commercial party (such as an insurance company). While we believe that our operations are structured to comply with applicable state laws with respect to physician relationships and referrals, any finding that we are not in compliance with these state laws could require us to change our operations or could subject us to penalties. This, in turn, could have a significantly negative impact on our operations.
False Claims
The submission of claims to a federal or state health care program for items and services that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to the imposition of civil monetary penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in state and federally funded health care programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, under false claims statutes such as the federal False Claims Act. Under the federal False Claims Act, actions against a provider can be initiated by the federal government or by a private party on behalf of the federal government. These private parties are often referred to as qui tam relators, and relators are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government. Both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, increasing the risk that a health care company like us will have to defend a false claims action, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid programs as a result of an investigation. Many states have enacted similar laws providing for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties for the filing of fraudulent claims. While we operate our business to avoid exposure under the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws, because of the complexity of the government regulations applicable to our industry, we cannot guarantee that we will not be the subject of an action under the federal False Claims Act or similar state law.
Anti-fraud Provisions of the HIPAA
In an effort to combat health care fraud, Congress included several anti-fraud measures in HIPAA. Among other things, HIPAA broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws, extended criminal penalties for Medicare and Medicaid fraud to other federal health care programs and expanded the authority of the OIG to exclude persons and entities from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. HIPAA also extended the Medicare and Medicaid civil monetary penalty provisions to other federal health care programs, increased the amounts of civil monetary penalties and established a criminal health care fraud statute.
Federal health care offenses under HIPAA include health care fraud and making false statements relating to health care matters. Under HIPAA, among other things, any person or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds or attempts to defraud a health care benefit program is subject to a fine, imprisonment or both. Also under HIPAA, any person or entity that knowingly and willfully falsifies or conceals or covers up a material fact or makes any materially false or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment of health care services by a health care benefit plan is subject to a fine, imprisonment or both. HIPAA applies not only to governmental plans but also to private payors.
Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA
HHS’s final regulations governing electronic transactions involving health information are part of the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, commonly referred to as the Transaction Standards rule. The rule establishes standards for eight of the most common health care transactions by reference to technical standards promulgated by recognized standards publishing organizations. Under the rule, any party transmitting or receiving health transactions electronically must send and receive data in a single format, rather than the large number of different data formats currently used. This rule applies to us in connection with submitting and processing health claims, and also applies to many of our payors and to our relationships with those payors. We believe that our operations materially comply with the Transaction Standards rule.
These regulatory requirements impose significant administrative and financial obligations on companies like us that use or disclose electronic health information. We have modified our existing HIPAA privacy and security policies and procedures to comply with the HIPAA regulations.
Civil Monetary Penalties
The Secretary of HHS may impose civil monetary penalties on any person or entity that presents, or causes to be presented, certain ineligible claims for medical items or services. The severity of penalties varies depending on the offense, from $2,000 to $50,000 per violation, plus treble damages for the amount at issue and may include exclusion from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
HHS can also impose penalties on a person or entity who offers inducements to beneficiaries for program services, who violates rules regarding the assignment of payments, or who knowingly gives false or misleading information that could reasonably influence the discharge of patients from a hospital. Persons who have been excluded from a federal health care program and who retain ownership in a participating entity, as well as persons who contract with excluded persons may be penalized.
HHS can also impose penalties for false or fraudulent claims and those that include services not provided as claimed. In addition, HHS may impose penalties on claims:
•for physician services that the person or entity knew or should have known were rendered by a person who was unlicensed, or by a person who misrepresented either their qualifications in obtaining their license or their certification in a medical specialty;
•for services furnished by a person who was, at the time the claim was made, excluded from the program to which the claim was made; or
•that show a pattern of medically unnecessary items or services.
Penalties also are applicable in certain other cases, including violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, payments to limit certain patient services and improper execution of statements of medical necessity.
Governmental Review, Audits, and Investigations
DHHS, CMS, DOJ, and other federal and state agencies continue to impose intensive enforcement policies and conduct random and directed audits, reviews, and investigations designed to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare program participation and payment laws and regulations. As a result, we are routinely the subject of such audits, reviews, and investigations. 
In addition, CMS engages third party contractors to conduct Additional Documentation Requests ("ADR") and other third party firms, including Unified Program Integrity Contractors ("UPICs"), Zone Program Integrity Contractors (“ZPICs”) and Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”), to conduct extensive reviews of claims data and state and Federal Government health care program laws and regulations applicable to healthcare providers. These audits evaluate the appropriateness of billings submitted for payment. Audit contractors identify overpayments resulting from incorrect payment amounts, non-covered services, medically unnecessary services, incorrectly coded services, and duplicate services, and are paid on a contingency basis. In addition to identifying overpayments, audit contractors can refer suspected violations of law to government enforcement authorities. 
The Department of Justice, CMS, or other federal and state enforcement and regulatory agencies may conduct additional investigations related to the Company's businesses in the future. These audits and investigations have caused and could potentially continue to cause delays in collections, recoupments, retroactive adjustment to amounts previously paid from governmental payors. Currently, the Company has recorded $12.0 million in other assets, which are from government payors related to the disputed finding of pending ZPIC audits. Additionally, these audits and investigations may subject the Company to sanctions, damages, extrapolation of damage findings, additional recoupments, fines, and other penalties (some of which may not be covered by insurance), termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, any of which may, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition and results of operations. 
We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any regulatory and other governmental audits and investigations. While such audits and investigations are the subject of administrative appeals, the appeals process, even if successful, may take several years to resolve. The Company’s costs to respond to and defend any such audits, reviews and investigations could be significant and are likely to increase in the current enforcement environment. 
Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws
We are subject to federal, state, and local regulations governing the storage, use, and disposal of materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling, and disposing of these hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from those hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all. We could incur significant costs and the diversion of our management’s attention to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. We are not aware of any violations related to compliance with environmental, health and safety laws through 2022.
Licensing
Our agencies and facilities are subject to state and local licensing regulations ranging from the adequacy of medical care to compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. To assure continued compliance with these various regulations, governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our agencies and facilities. Additionally, health care professionals at our agencies and facilities are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state law. We operate our business to ensure that our employees and agents possess all necessary licenses and certifications.
The institutional pharmacy operations within our facility-based services segment are also subject to regulation by the various states in which we conduct the pharmacy business, as well as by the federal government. The pharmacies are regulated under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, which are administered by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, administered by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, as a dispenser of controlled substances, our pharmacy operations must register with the Drug Enforcement Administration, file reports of inventories and transactions and provide adequate security 
measures. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties. We are not aware of any violations of applicable laws relating to our institutional pharmacy operations through December 31, 2022.
Certificate of Need and Permit of Approval Laws
In addition to state licensing laws, some states require a provider to obtain a certificate of need or permit of approval prior to establishing, constructing, acquiring, or expanding certain health services, operations, or facilities. In these states, approvals are required for capital expenditures exceeding certain amounts that involve certain facilities or services, including home nursing agencies. The certificate of need or permit of approval issued by the state determines the service areas for the applicable agency or program. The following U.S. jurisdictions require certificates of need or permits of approval for home nursing agencies: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. In addition, the states of Louisiana and Mississippi continue to have state issued moratorium on the issuance of new licenses for home nursing agencies that we expect to remain in effect for 2023.  As of December 31, 2022, we operated 376 home health and hospice locations in certificates of need or moratorium states, with the majority of locations being in Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, respectively. 
State certificate of need and permit of approval laws generally provide that, prior to the addition of new capacity, the construction of new facilities or the introduction of new services, a designated state health planning agency must determine that a need exists for those beds, facilities, or services. The process is intended to promote comprehensive health care planning, assist in providing high quality health care at the lowest possible cost and avoid unnecessary duplication by ensuring that only needed health care facilities and operations are built and opened.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 30,000 employees, of which 16,000 were full-time. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees and independent contractors to be good.
Insurance
We are subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. To cover claims that may arise, we maintain commercial insurance for healthcare professional liability, general liability, automobile liability, employed lawyers liability, fiduciary liability, crime liability, information security and privacy liabilities, and workers’ compensation/employer’s liability in amounts that we believe are appropriate and sufficient for our operations. We maintain claims-made healthcare professional liability and occurrence based general liability insurance that provides primary limits of $1.0 million per incident/ occurrence and $3.0 million in annual aggregate amounts. We maintain workers’ compensation insurance that meets state statutory requirements and provides a primary employer liability limit of $1.0 million to cover claims that may arise in the states in which we operate, excluding Washington. Coverage for workers' compensation matters within the State of Washington is procured from the State's respective mandated program. Under our workers’ compensation insurance policies, the Company maintains a deductible of the first $1.0 million in workers' compensation liability. We maintain automobile liability insurance for all owned, hired and non-owned autos with a primary limit of $1.0 million. In addition, we currently maintain multiple layers of umbrella coverage in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million that provides excess coverage for healthcare professional liability, general liability, automobile liability and employer’s liability. We also maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance in the aggregate amount of $80.0 million. The cost and availability of insurance coverage has varied widely in recent years. While we believe that our insurance policies and coverage are adequate for a business enterprise of our type, we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover all future claims or that it will continue to be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.
