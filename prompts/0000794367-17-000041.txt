General
The Company is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1985. The Company and its predecessors have been operating department stores since 1830. The Company operates 829 stores in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. As of January 28, 2017, the Company's operations were conducted through Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Bloomingdale’s The Outlet, Macy’s Backstage, Bluemercury and Macy’s China Limited. In addition, Bloomingdale's in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Al Zahra, Kuwait are operated under license agreements with Al Tayer Insignia, a company of Al Tayer Group, LLC.
The Company sells a wide range of merchandise, including apparel and accessories (men’s, women’s and children’s), cosmetics, home furnishings and other consumer goods. The specific assortments vary by size of store, merchandising assortments and character of customers in the trade areas. Most stores are located at urban or suburban sites, principally in densely populated areas across the United States.
For 2016, 2015 and 2014, the following merchandise constituted the following percentages of sales:


 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Women’s Accessories, Intimate Apparel, Shoes, Cosmetics and Fragrances | 38 | % | | 38 | % | 38 | %

Home/Miscellaneous | 16 | | | 16 | | 16 | 
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

In 2016, the Company’s subsidiaries provided various support functions to the Company’s retail operations on an integrated, company-wide basis.

• | The Company’s bank subsidiary, FDS Bank, provides credit processing, certain collections, customer service and credit marketing services in respect of all credit card accounts that are owned either by Department Stores National Bank (“DSNB”), a subsidiary of Citibank, N.A., or FDS Bank and that constitute a part of the credit programs of the Company’s retail operations.


• | Macy’s Systems and Technology, Inc. (“MST”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, provides operational electronic data processing and management information services to all of the Company’s operations other than Bluemercury and Macy's China Limited.


• | Macy’s Merchandising Group, Inc. (“MMG”), a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company, and its subsidiary Macy's Merchandising Group International, LLC, are responsible for the design, development and marketing of Macy’s private label brands and certain licensed brands. Bloomingdale’s uses MMG for a small portion of its private label merchandise. The Company believes that its private label merchandise differentiates its merchandise assortments from those of its competitors and delivers exceptional value to its customers. MMG also offers its services, either directly or indirectly, to unrelated third parties.


• | Macy’s Logistics and Operations (“Macy’s Logistics”), a division of a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, provides warehousing and merchandise distribution services for the Company’s operations and digital customer fulfillment.

Employees
As of January 28, 2017, the Company had approximately 148,300 regular full-time and part-time employees. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the number of employees peaks in the holiday season. Approximately 10% of the Company’s employees as of January 28, 2017 were represented by unions. 
2

Seasonality
The retail business is seasonal in nature with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in the months of November and December. Working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, increasing in mid-summer in anticipation of the fall merchandising season and increasing substantially prior to the holiday season when the Company carries significantly higher inventory levels.
Purchasing
The Company purchases merchandise from many suppliers, no one of which accounted for more than 5% of the Company’s net purchases during 2016. The Company has no material long-term purchase commitments with any of its suppliers, and believes that it is not dependent on any one supplier. The Company considers its relations with its suppliers to be good.
Private Label Brands and Related Trademarks
The principal private label brands currently offered by the Company include Alfani, American Rag, Aqua, Bar III, Belgique, Charter Club, Club Room, Epic Threads, first impressions, Giani Bernini, Greg Norman for Tasso Elba, Holiday Lane, Home Design, Hotel Collection, Hudson Park, Ideology, I-N-C, jenni, JM Collection, John Ashford, Karen Scott, lune+aster, M-61, Maison Jules, Martha Stewart Collection, Material Girl, Morgan Taylor, Oake, Sky, Style & Co., Sutton Studio, Tasso Elba, Thalia Sodi, the cellar, and Tools of the Trade.

Competition
The retailing industry is intensely competitive. The Company’s operations compete with many retailing formats, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, off-price and discount stores, manufacturers’ outlets, online retailers, catalogs and television shopping, among others. The Company seeks to attract customers by offering most wanted selections, obvious value, and distinctive marketing in stores that are located in premier locations, and by providing an exciting shopping environment and superior service through an omnichannel experience. Other retailers may compete for customers on some or all of these bases, or on other bases, and may be perceived by some potential customers as being better aligned with their particular preferences.
