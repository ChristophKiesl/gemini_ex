Unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise, references in this annual report on Form 10-K to “Hypersolar”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our” refer to Hypersolar, Inc.
 
Overview
 
At HyperSolar, Inc., our goal is to replace all forms of energy on earth with renewable energy.
 
Inspired by the photosynthetic process that plants use to harness the power of the sun to create energy molecules, we are developing a novel solar-powered particle system that mimics photosynthesis to separate hydrogen from water.
 
Hydrogen is the lightest and abundant chemical element, constituting roughly 75% of the universe’s chemical elemental mass (Palmer, D. (13 September 1997). “Hydrogen in the Universe.” NASA). In its purest form, hydrogen is a non-toxic colorless and odorless gas. However, naturally occurring elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on earth and hydrogen gas is most often produced using fossil fuels. Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas and is usually employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being crude oil processing (hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. We are developing what we believe is a cleaner and greener way to produce this high value product.
 
Hydrogen (when used as a fuel), like electricity, is an energy carrier rather than an energy resource. If hydrogen was easily accessed from the earth and the world could depend on it for fuel, eliminating our reliance on fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas, our carbon footprint and global climate change issues would be erased.
 
Today, over 50 million metric tons of molecular hydrogen is produced globally for use as a chemical intermediate for critical industrial processes and as a fuel for power equipment and transportation. Over 99% of hydrogen produced today is produced using a fossil fuel, methane (natural gas) in a method called steam reforming, SMR. Although commercially optimized over decades, the SMR process is capital intensive and will remain so due to the fundamental nature of the process which includes: (1) three separate reactors with different catalysts operating at different temperatures, (2) large amounts of heat transfer needed for the endothermic reforming and exothermic water gas shift, and (3) the need to remove all carbon oxides using capital and energy intensive methods. (source: Nikolaidis, P.; Poullikkas, A., A comparative overview of hydrogen production processes. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 2017, 67, 597-611.)
 
Besides being capital intensive, the SMR method releases harmful levels of carbon dioxide into the air further contributing to our global climate crisis.
 
Despite the current method of production, the benefits of hydrogen for transportation emissions are far better than other fossil fuel alternatives of oil and gas, as the only emission of hydrogen is pure water. This fact dictates that we look for another method of making hydrogen to make it the world’s premier fuel by producing it in a more sustainable green way.
 
Market Opportunity
 
HyperSolar believes we are still in the early stages of the hydrogen fuel market development, and yet, this market continues to grow exponentially. One of the reasons for this growth is adoption of hydrogen fuel technologies within an increased number of major industries and spanning many applications.

Overall Growth 
 
A recent report cites the hydrogen generation market to be valued at $115 Billion in 2017 to reaching $154 Billion by 2022, a significant set of figures. However, it is important to note that the vast majority of hydrogen fuel is developed for refineries, as well as ammonia and methanol production. Fuel cell technologies including energy storage, auto manufacturing, material handling and others, represent a smaller but rapidly growing portion of the hydrogen generation market.
 
It is within these industries that HyperSolar believes its renewable hydrogen producing technology possesses significant market opportunity, especially as innovation and infrastructure continue to develop. This is further evidenced by studies that specifically address the fuel cell market, which was valued at $3.21 billion in 2015, but expected to reach nearly $25 billion by 2025. According to the report, the “transportation segment is expected to emerge as the fastest growing segment owing to increasing demand for this type of hydrogen powered forklifts and also increasing research and development activities in regions such as Europe to develop hybrid vehicles powered by hydrogen.”
 
Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles
 
One of the most recognized applications for hydrogen fuel technologies falls within the auto manufacturing and vehicles industries. The three leading manufacturers of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are in order, Toyota, Hyundai, and Honda – three internationally recognized companies. Industry reports cite the need for increased infrastructure, such as fueling stations, for the industry to garner even greater market acceptance. However, the same report indicates there will be 22.2 million hydrogen fuel cell vehicles sold or leased by 2032, driving revenues upwards of $1.1 trillion.
 
General Motors, who entered into an agreement with Honda to build a $85 million hydrogen fuel facility, has worked in collaboration with the United States Army to produce a hydrogen fuel cell truck for military use. The first versions of the prototype have been promising, according to the two parties.
 
Lastly, hydrogen fuel cell buses have continued to become more prevalent, with more than 370 fuel cell systems delivered or on order. This report also cites Ballard Power Systems signing several large supply agreements with Chinese companies, and also delivered, or received orders for, fuel cell buses in for deployment in cities in the U.S. and Europe.
 
Blending Hydrogen into Natural Gas Networks and Hydrogen Storage
 
One of the areas of greatest potential for hydrogen fuel is its ability to be successfully integrated into existing natural gas pipelines. It is well documented that hydrogen storage maintains energy for longer periods of time. Were it to be produced cost effectively, utilities could use hydrogen to store and deploy energy produced via solar and wind through existing natural gas plants and pipelines, without having such strong dependency on fossil fuels as a backup. 
 
In September 2017, an analyst from Bloomberg New Energy Finance referenced hydrogen’s potential for moving to a renewable economy, citing the World Economic Forum Hydrogen Council’s efforts to integrate hydrogen using cleaner infrastructure. Doing so by using existing natural gas pipelines would be a tremendous step in this direction, as connecting hydrogen producers with end users using this method would require limited investment in infrastructure. In fact, a report distributed by the US Department of Energy states:
 
“Blending hydrogen into natural gas pipeline networks at low concentrations has the potential to increase output from renewable energy production facilities in the near term. In the longer term, blending may provide an economic means of hydrogen delivery when the hydrogen is injected upstream and then extracted downstream for use in fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) or stationary fuel cells.”

Our Technology
 
Technology for Making Renewable Hydrogen from Sunlight
 
Hydrogen (H2) is the third most abundant element on earth and cleanest fuel in the universe, (Dresselhaus, Mildred et al. (May 15, 2003). “Basic Research Needs for the Hydrogen Economy”). Unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used, hydrogen fuel usage produces only pure water (H2O) as the byproduct. Unfortunately, pure hydrogen does not exist naturally on earth and therefore must be manufactured. Historically, the cost of manufacturing hydrogen as an alternative fuel has been higher than the cost of the energy used to make it. This is the dilemma of the hydrogen economy, and one that we aim to address.
 
For over a century, splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis has been well known. This technology can be used to produce an unlimited amount of clean and renewable hydrogen fuel to power a carbon-free world. However, in practice, current commercial electrolysis technologies require (a) expensive electricity and (b) highly purified water to prevent fouling of system components. We believe these are the major barriers to affordable production of renewable hydrogen.
 
The Perfect and Sustainable Energy Cycle
 
As it turns out, Mother Nature has been making hydrogen using sunlight since the beginning of time by splitting water molecules (H2O) into its basic elements - hydrogen and oxygen. This is exactly what plant leaves do every day using photosynthesis. Since the produced hydrogen is immediately consumed inside the plant, we cannot simply grow trees to make hydrogen.
 
If technology can be developed to mimic photosynthesis to split water into hydrogen, then a truly sustainable, low cost, and renewable energy cycle can be created to power the earth. However, cost has been the biggest barrier to realizing this vision.
 
Water Splitting
 
In the process of splitting a water molecule, input energy is transferred into the chemical bonds of the resulting hydrogen molecule. So in essence, manufactured hydrogen is simply a carrier or battery-like storage of the input energy. If the input energy is from fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, then dirty carbon fossil fuel energy is simply transferred into hydrogen. If the input energy is renewable such as solar and wind, then new and clean energy is stored in hydrogen.
 
While the concept of water splitting is very appealing, the following challenges must be addressed for renewable hydrogen to be commercially viable:
 

● | Energy Inefficiency — Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, the most energy it can store is 100% of the input energy. However, conventional systems approach to electrolysis lose so much of the input energy in system components, wires and electrodes resulting in only a small portion of electricity making it into the hydrogen molecules. This translates to high production cost and is the fundamental problem with water splitting for hydrogen production. We intend to address this problem with our low cost and energy efficient particle technology. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Need for Clean Water — Conventional electrolysis requires highly purified clean water to prevent fouling of system components. This prevents current technology from using large quantities of available water from oceans, rivers, industrial waste and municipal waste as feedstock. Our technology is being designed to use any natural water or waste water for the unlimited production of renewable hydrogen. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology
 
Electrolysis water-splitting in its simplest form is the transfer of “input electrons” in the following chemical reactions:
 

● | Cathode (reduction): 2 H2O + 2e- -> H2 + 2 OH- 
--+---------------------------------------------------
● | Anode (oxidation): 4 OH- -> O2 + 2 H2O + 4 e- 

 
From these equations it can be deduced that if every input electron (e-) is put to work and not lost, then a maximum amount of input electrons (i.e. energy) is transferred and stored in the hydrogen molecules (H2). Additionally, if there were a very high number of cathode and anode reaction areas within a given volume of water, then a very high number of these reactions could happen simultaneously throughout the medium to split each water molecule into hydrogen wherever electrons are available.


HyperSolar H2Generator™
 
Since our particles are intended to mimic the natural room temperature conditions of photosynthesis, they can be housed in very low cost reactors such as glass vessels or clear plastic bags. To facilitate the commercial use of our self-contained particle technology we are developing a modular system that will enable the daily production and storage of hydrogen for any time use in electricity generation, oil and gas refining, fertilizer manufacturing or any other current and future applications of hydrogen.

We refer to our technology as the HyperSolar H2Generator which is comprised of the following components:



1. | The Generator Housing - Novel (patent pending) is the first of its type to safely separate oxygen and hydrogen in the water splitting process without sacrificing efficiency. This device houses the water, the solar particles/cells and is designed with inlets and outlets for water and gasses. Utilizing a special membrane for separating the oxygen side from the hydrogen side, proton transport is increased which is the key to safely increasing solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Our design can be scaled up and is easily manufactured for commercial use. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The NanoParticle or Solar Cell - Our patented nanoparticle consist of thousands of tiny solar cells that are electrodeposited into one tiny structure to provide the charge that splits the water molecule when the sun excites the electron. In the process of optimizing our nanoparticles to be efficient and only use earth abundant materials, (an ongoing process), we experimented with commercially available triple junction silicon solar cells to perform tests with our generator housing and other components. Through this experimentation, our discovery makes us believe we can bring a system to market utilizing these readily available cells while our nanoparticles are still being optimized. These solar cells also absorb the sunlight and produce the necessary charge for splitting the water molecule to produce the hydrogen and oxygen.

3. | Oxygen Evolution Catalyst - This proprietary catalyst developed in the University of Iowa lab is uniformly applied onto the solar cell or nanoparticle efficiently collects holes to oxidize water molecule to generate oxygen gas. The oxygen evolution catalyst must be transparent to absorb the sun’s energy or light. It must be stable in alkaline, neutral and acidic environments. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst - Necessary for collecting electrons to reduce protons for generating hydrogen gas, we recently announced the successful integration of a low-cost hydrogen catalyst into our generator system successfully coating a triple junction solar cell with a catalyst comprised primarily of ruthenium (10 weight %), carbon and nitrogen that can function as well as platinum, the current catalyst used for hydrogen production, but at a 20x reduced cost. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Transparent Conductive Coating - A patent pending coating to protect our nanoparticles and solar cells from photocorrosion and efficiently transfer charges to catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | A concentrator equal to two suns - This inexpensive Fresnel lens concentrator to increase sunlight to equal two suns reduces our necessary footprint for a 1000 KG per day system by 40%. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In the next twelve months, we hope to complete our optimization of these primary components and prove the sustainability of the system for hydrogen production over long periods of time. During this process, we are seeking the following strategic partners:
 

1. | A manufacturing design and build partner to build housings that can be implemented on land or roof top applications. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Cement a strategic partnership with Xunlight or another triple junction solar cell manufacturer. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | A strategic financial and utilization partner to deploy our systems on their own warehouse rooftops or adjacent land for hydrogen production necessary as required for their fuel cell power equipment.

We anticipate that the HyperSolar H2Generator will be a self-contained renewable hydrogen production system that requires only sunlight and any source of water. As a result, it can be installed almost anywhere to produce hydrogen fuel at or near the point of distribution, for local use. This model of hydrogen production addresses one of the biggest challenges of using clean hydrogen fuel on a large scale which is the transportation of hydrogen.
 
Each stage of the HyperSolar H2Generator can be scaled independently according to the hydrogen demands and length of storage required for a specific application. A small-scale system can be used to produce continuous renewable electricity for a small house, or a large scale system can be used to produce hydrogen to power a community.


Intellectual Property
 
On November 15, 2011 we filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect the intellectual property rights for “Photoelectrochemically Active Heterostructures, Methods For Their Manufacture, And Methods And Systems For Producing Desired Products.” On March 14, 2017, this patent was granted as United States Patent No. 9,593,053. The patent protects the Company’s proprietary design of a self-contained solar-to-hydrogen device made up of millions of solar powered water-splitting nanoparticles, per square centimeter. These nanoparticles are coated with a separate patent-pending protective coating that prevents corrosion during extended periods of hydrogen production. The aim of these nanoparticles is high conversion efficiency and low cost.
 
An important aspect of the patented technology is the integrated structures of high-density arrays of nano-sized solar cells as part of hydrogen production nanoparticles. The technology enables manufacturing of ultra-thin sheets for solar-to-hydrogen production, requiring substantially less material as compared to conventional solar cells used in rooftop power applications. 

In September of 2012, we jointly filed with the University of California, Santa Barbara (“UCSB”) an additional patent application to protect the intellectual property rights of our proprietary coating for protecting our semiconductor devices from corrosion in various types of water. This patent is titled: “Process And Systems For Stable Operation of Electroactive Devices”. The invention is directed towards processes and systems for stable operation of electrical, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and photosynthetic devices with increased efficiency, stability, and low cost. In particular, what is disclosed are new functional coating materials and applications of those coatings that are optically transparent, electronically conducting, electrocatalytically active, thermally stable, and which can be applied conform ally and easily on an electroactive unit for stable and efficient operation. We believe this patent will be valuable beyond our specific utilization in developing hydrogen from water using the power of the sun. In February of 2013 we filed the utility patent application for the above and the examination and prosecution of this patent are ongoing.

In March of 2015, we jointly filed a full utility patent application with UCSB for the “method of manufacture of multi-junction artificial photosynthetic cells.” The patent’s full coverage excludes others from making, using, or selling the technology process, and creates licensing opportunities. We believe licensing opportunities can be created through various industry applications, such as for car charging stations, retail distribution centers, and facilities that would benefit from cost-efficient hydrogen developed at or near the point of distribution. Examination and prosecution of this patent are ongoing.
 
On December 21, 2016, we filed jointly with the University of Iowa a patent for “Integrated Membrane Solar Fuel Assembly” to protect the intellectual property for our generator housing system that safely separates oxygen and hydrogen in the water splitting process without sacrificing efficiency. This device houses the water, the solar particles/cells and is designed with inlets and outlets for water and gasses. Utilizing a special membrane for separating the oxygen side from the hydrogen side, proton transport is increased which is the key to safely increasing solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. We are currently working on the Utility application to protect the IP for this device in the US and multiple countries.


Strategic Partners
 
Effective June 1, 2017 we entered into a one-year extension of our agreement with the University of Iowa to help accelerate our research and development efforts to reach our goal of producing commercially viable renewable hydrogen. As consideration under the sponsorship research agreement (“Iowa SRA”), the University of Iowa will receive $142,243 from the Company. When expenditures reach that amount, we will no longer be obligated to fund any additional research activities, and the University of Iowa will not be obligated to perform any additional research activities pursuant to the SRA, unless mutually agreed upon. This agreement expires on May 31, 2018.
 
In June of 2017, we extended our sponsorship research agreement (“UCSB SRA”) with UCSB through June 30, 2018. The UCSB SRA is intended to help achieve important milestones in the company’s development plan.
 
Due to credit on our account and other funds available, the UCSB extension is at no cost to the Company. U.S. Patent Law and university policy will govern any patentable developments or discoveries throughout the course of the SRA. If such an invention is determined to be jointly owned by us and UCSB, we will prepare and file, at our cost, patent applications for such invention and claim it as a joint invention in the name of both the Company and UCSB, and shall prosecute and maintain such joint patent rights. Neither party may assign its joint ownership in such patents without the consent of the other party. We have a time-limited first right to negotiate a license to UCSB’s interest in any joint invention.
 
We believe the partnership with UCSB will enable us to refine our solar-powered particle technology for generating zero carbon hydrogen and renewable natural gas using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide (CO2). The research project is led by Professor Eric McFarland in the Department of Chemical Engineering at UCSB.


Competition
 
Currently, most hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of natural gas or methane. This production technology dominates due to easy availability and low prices of natural gas. Partial oxidation of petroleum oil is second in production capacity after steam reforming of natural gas. The third largest production technology in terms of production capacity is steam gasification of coal. The current industry is heavily dominated by large players such as Air Products and Chemicals Inc. and Air Liquide.

The energy source and feedstock used in these existing production technologies are fossil fuels. Therefore, the hydrogen produced is not considered renewable. We are developing a new low cost technology to use sunlight as the energy source to split water into hydrogen in a truly renewable fashion. To our knowledge, there are no commercially available technologies for producing large quantities of renewable hydrogen that are cost competitive with fossil fuel based hydrogen. Niche market electrolysis systems that split water for hydrogen production have existed for a long time but their capital and operating costs are much higher than conventional hydrogen. Various academic and research institutions around the world are attempting to develop renewable hydrogen production technologies as well. To our knowledge, none have reached commercial success.
 
If we are able to complete the commercial development of our technology, we do not intend to manufacture hydrogen and compete with companies such as Air Liquide. We intend to license our technology to companies like Air Products and Air Liquide for the production of renewable hydrogen used in applications such as hydrogen vehicle fueling stations and hydrogen power plants.
