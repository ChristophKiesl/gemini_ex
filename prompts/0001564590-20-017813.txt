Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 We are a Delaware corporation formerly known as GigCapital, Inc., and as a result of our business combination with Kaleyra S.p.A. on November 25, 2019, we changed our name to Kaleyra, Inc. (which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our “Business Combination”). 
Business Overview
 Our Vision
 Kaleyra provides its customers and business partners with a trusted cloud communications platform (the “Platform”) that seamlessly integrates software services and applications for business-to-consumer communications between Kaleyra’s customers and their end-user customers and partners on a global basis. The demand for cloud communications is increasingly driven by the growing, and often mandated, need for enterprises to undertake a digital transformation that includes omni-channel, mobile first interactive end-user customer communications. This complements new workflows that Kaleyra’s customers have developed which are driven by software and artificial intelligence to automate certain end-user customer-facing processes before, during and after transactions. These communications are increasingly managed through mobile network operators as the gateway to reach end-user consumers’ mobile devices. Kaleyra’s Platform enables these communications by integrating mobile alert notifications and interactive capabilities to reach and engage end user customers. Kaleyra’s Platform couples a “Software as a Service” or SaaS business model, creating what is generally referred to as a “cloud communications platform as a service”, or simply CPaaS.
 Kaleyra’s vision is to be the CPaaS provider which best aligns with its customers’ and business partners’ communication requirements, or the most trusted provider, in the world. This requires a combination of security, compliance and integration capabilities that protects the integrity and privacy of Kaleyra’s customers’ transactions and includes other key features such as ease of provisioning, reliable network connectivity, high availability for scaling, redundancy, embedded regulatory compliance, configurable monitoring and reporting. Kaleyra believes the percentage of CPaaS customers that will require security, compliance and integration will represent an increasingly larger portion of the market, particularly with expected exponential growth of transactional-by-nature cloud communications applications, better enabling Kaleyra to set itself apart from its competition.
 Kaleyra Today
 Kaleyra is a result of the expansion of the former Ubiquity, which was founded in Milan, Italy in 1999. Ubiquity secured a leading market position in mobile messaging on behalf of the Italian financial services industry and then sought to expand its products and geographic offerings. Ubiquity acquired Solutions Infini of Bangalore, India beginning in 2017 and Buc Mobile of Vienna, Virginia in 2018. It was rebranded as Kaleyra S.p.A. in February 2018. Following the integration of the acquired entities, the combined company is collectively engaged in the operation of the Platform on behalf of Kaleyra’s customers.
 Kaleyra has more than 3,000 customers and business partners worldwide across industry verticals such as financial services, ecommerce and transportation, with no single customer representing more than 15% of revenues. Kaleyra’s customers are located in regions throughout the world including in Europe, Asia Pacific and North America. Kaleyra’s revenue by country for the year ended December 31, 2019 is as follows: Italy (46.4%), India (27.1%) and the United States (7.3%). The remainder of revenue is primarily generated in Europe and Asia in countries other than Italy and India (19.2%).
 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, 86% of revenues came from customers of Kaleyra which have been on the Platform for at least one year. Although Kaleyra continues to expand by introducing new customers to the Platform, the breadth and stability of its existing customers provide it with a solid base of revenue upon which it can continue to innovate and make investment to strengthen its product portfolio, expand its global presence, and in particular into the Americas and Asia-Pacific markets following the acquisitions of Buc Mobile and Solutions Infini, recruit world-class talent and target accretive acquisitions to capitalize on its growing market penetration opportunities and value creation.

Kaleyra’s underlying technology used in the Platform is the same across all of its communication services which can generally be described as “omni-channel mobile first interactive notifications via a public or private cloud implementation.” These services include programmable voice/Interactive Voice Response (IVR) configurations, inbound/outbound short message service (SMS) capabilities, hosted telephone numbers, and other types of IP communications services such as e-mail and WhatsApp®.
 Customers
 Kaleyra’s customers are enterprises which use digital mobile communications in the conduct of their business. Kaleyra’s Platform enables these communications by integrating mobile alert notifications and interactive capabilities to reach and engage end user customers. Kaleyra enables its customers and business partners to connect enterprise software and applications to mobile network operators by providing a single simple interface by which Kaleyra can undertake as necessary to make upgrades in its service offerings to account for new end-user consumer behavior changes and progress (such as adding WhatsApp integration). In most cases, Kaleyra provides multiple levels of customer support 24x7 to ensure service levels and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of Kaleyra’s customers. Customers and business partners which use the Platform value the Platform’s network reliability, and Kaleyra’s responsive customer support, competitive pricing, and collaborative approach.
 Kaleyra services a broad base of customers and business partners throughout the world operating in diverse businesses and regions. Kaleyra’s business is generated by providing data to the telecommunications provider and transmitting message data from its customers and business partners. Kaleyra has a concentration of business within the financial services industry that serve their major European banking end-user customers. With each relationship Kaleyra is the link between the financial institutions and their unique, end-user customers. In linking these two parties, Kaleyra’s Platform leverages the end-user telecommunications provider to transmit critical message data to these end-user customers.
 For example, banks and financial institutions deploy Kaleyra’s services that include omni-channel mobile first password reset, account access, two-factor authentications (2FA), transaction notification, and anti-fraud alerts, among other services, via a cloud implementation that meets their strict requirements for security and compliance. Kaleyra’s Platform has facilitated compliant communications for its existing financial institution customer base in Europe. European Central Bank (ECB) regulations have begun to mandate additional customer protection regulations, such as those requiring strong customer authentications for all payment transactions over 30 euros, causing both traditional banks and new entrants to undergo a digital transformation. In the financial sector, security and compliance are generally top of mind and the sales process relies on a dedicated local sales team focused on strong integration capabilities with the full suite of services needed to satisfy customer requirements.
 Other enterprise customers of Kaleyra use Kaleyra’s cloud communications services as packaged offerings that are easy to configure and manage around key end-user customer touchpoints. Although these enterprise customers require a lesser level of system integration than do financial institution customers, they still demand a sufficiently flexible system such as that which a cloud solution can provide in order to facilitate rapid communications system modification to accommodate changes in end-user customer behaviors. Furthermore, there are other enterprise customers for which connectivity to their end user customers is their primary requirement, and these customers are using the Platform to gain access to mobile network operators worldwide. This additional volume, which is expected to continue to grow as the transformation from e-mail-based communications to messaging-based communications is being enhanced, allows Kaleyra to leverage relationships to sell and resell network connectivity on a more cost-effective basis.
 In both 2019 and 2018, Kaleyra had one customer, Telecom Italia S.p.A. which accounted for more than 10% of Kaleyra’s revenues.
 Kaleyra has multiple, large European commercial banks as business partners, with one of these partners, Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., accounting for more than 10% of Kaleyra’s volumes in 2019 and 2018.

Seasonality
 Historically, Kaleyra has experienced clear seasonality in its revenue generation, with slower traction in the first calendar quarter, and increasing revenues as the year progresses toward the higher revenues in messaging and notification services during the fourth calendar quarter. This patterned revenue generation behavior takes place due to Kaleyra’s customers sending more messages to their end-user customers who are engaged in consumer transactions at the end of the calendar year, resulting in an increase in notifications of electronic payments, credit card transactions and e-commerce.
The Market for Kaleyra’s Products
 The CPaaS market is evolving and is expanding in several directions as enterprise adoption of cloud-based communications occurs. The need for enterprises to provide enhanced end-user customer experiences is driving adoption by enterprises of embedded, real-time messaging communications for enhanced end-user customer-interfacing interactions. According to 451 Research, in 2019 the total CPaaS market was approximately $2.2 billion and forecasted to increase to approximately $6.2 billion by the end of 20221. Furthermore, according to GSMA, the SMS business messaging revenue market was approximately $60.0 billion in 2018 and will increase to approximately $90.0 billion by the end of 2022.2 Kaleyra’s products and services available through the Platform address both of these markets.
 Kaleyra’s Key Products
 The Platform
 Kaleyra operates its core technology, the Platform, in the public cloud and as private clouds, and in hybrid situations. The Platform has a high-volume infrastructure that has been designed to easily scale and support large volumes of data. The Platform consists of two separate types of interfaces; one for connectivity to mobile network operators and the other, a set of Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) that provide convenient and user-friendly tools that enable Kaleyra’s customers to engage in communications with their end-user customers. The Platform’s underlying software code base contains communication protocols that allow connectivity with mobile network operators around the globe.
 In addition, the Platform’s APIs, which sit on top of the underlying connectivity stack, enable the creation of specific applications (messaging or voice-over-IP calls) or workflows (2FA or password resets). These applications can be designed by Kaleyra, Kaleyra’s customers’ information technologies personnel or third-party developers. The open Platform’s architecture enables Kaleyra’s customers and business partners to accomplish all of their communication needs from one simple interface that connects into a broad range of their systems. The relationship with Kaleyra’s customers is strengthened by providing its customers with a broad and flexible platform. Retention of Kaleyra’s customers is also enhanced as a result of the switching costs that Kaleyra’s customers would incur to transition to alternate platforms.

Communications Services
 The following graphic summarizes the capabilities of Kaleyra’s suite of communications services:
 

This suite of services is further described below. During the year ended December 31, 2019 Kaleyra processed nearly 27 billion billable SMS messages and 3 billion voice calls on behalf of Kaleyra’s customers. In 2020, this is expected to exceed 30 billion billable SMS messages and 4 billion voice calls.
Messaging
 The Platform’s APIs include software and infrastructure that process and manage SMS, Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Rich Communications Service (RCS), with network connectivity to mobile network operators around the world. The Platform is currently designed to process five thousand messages per second, with the capability to increase the throughput with additional server power and speed. The Platform supports 87 languages and is capable of stitching together concatenated messages of up to 4,000 characters. The Platform is also designed to manage automated opt-in and opt-out procedures per mobile network operator requirements and best practices. As noted above, in 2019 the Platform processed nearly 27 billion SMS messages.
Voice
 The Platform’s APIs includes software and infrastructure that process and manage voice calls, including IVR and conferencing bridge capabilities. The Platform offers features such as call masking, visual configurations of call routing, click to call, and allows Nature Language Processing (NLP) integrations. In 2019, the Platform processed nearly 3 billion voice calls.
 FinTech
 The Platform’s APIs also include software and infrastructure to process and manage financial transactions that has been enabled by the open banking initiative and was regulated in September 2019. However the European Banking Authority has granted a 15-month extension to banks to adopt the new law, until December 2020. The driving force behind open banking is the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), an European Union (“EU”) directive designed to expand end-user consumer choice of products in banking, credit cards, and payment services. The Platform includes features and capabilities to perform PSD2 compliant banking or payment transactions.
 Numbers
 Finally, the Platform’s APIs include software and infrastructure that process and manage telephone numbers and short code services. Short codes are often used to send or receive a large volume of broadcast or bulk SMS messages. The Platform currently supports provisioning and configuration of telephone numbers or short codes in 50 countries. Other Numbers services include telephone number lookup query and local number portability.

Operations
 Kaleyra generates revenue from usage-based fees earned from the sale of communications services utilizing the Platform. These services are offered through software solutions to large enterprises, as well as small and medium-sized customers. Revenue can be billed in advance or in arrears depending on the term of the agreement; for the majority of customers, revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis in arrears.
 Kaleyra’s CPaaS contracts do not provide customers and business partners with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications.
 As a part of the arrangement with its customers, Kaleyra offers customer advanced support services, to guarantee the continuity and promptly delivery of the services. Revenue for these services is recognized ratably over the term of the service period.
 Kaleyra utilizes a cloud infrastructure and its Platform to deliver its communication services. The services are also provided using a private cloud as required by the customers and business partners. The costs of the Platform and communication services purchased from mobile network operators is considered to be a cost of revenue.
 Products in Development
 Kaleyra has a number of new communications services in its organic development pipeline. For example, Kaleyra is developing a visual “drag-and-drop” builder user interface for use by both developers and non-developers that reduces the complexity of implementing cloud communications services. Kaleyra has a growing team of software developers in Bangalore, India engaged in research and development of additional product features based on customer feedback and market research. In addition, Kaleyra is looking at possible acquisitions that can enhance its product portfolio.
Research and Development
 As of December 31, 2019, 130 employees serve in Kaleyra’s research and development and engineering departments representing about 49% of its workforce, focused on maintaining and enhancing the Platform and the communications service offerings, as well as developing new communications services and engaging with Kaleyra’s customers in this development.
Sales and Marketing
 Kaleyra has multiple methods for engaging with its customers, depending upon the specific service offerings that a customer uses on the Platform, 35% of Kaleyra’s employee base are dedicated to sales of communications services to Kaleyra’s customers or business partners. The go-to-market strategy utilizes a mixture of direct sales and channel development such as using third party developers which are developing communications solutions for multiple customers. Kaleyra also actively participates in trade shows and other general industry marketing efforts on a global basis for the purpose of lead generation and building of brand awareness.
Competitive Strengths
 Over Kaleyra’s 20-year history, Kaleyra has developed a powerful CPaaS solution that it believes represents a unique, high growth opportunity in the CPaaS market. The Platform is accessible everywhere in the world, has a high-volume infrastructure that has been designed to be easily scalable, and allows for communications services that have been designed having security, compliance and integration capabilities that can meet the needs of Kaleyra’s customers and their customers and regulators. Furthermore, Kaleyra continues to develop organically and strategically new communications services to meet the evolving needs of its customers and business partners. In addition, Kaleyra has identified the following competitive strengths:

Experienced Management Team
 Kaleyra has a proven management team with many decades of combined experience at industry relevant companies. Along with the existing management team, it is anticipated that additional senior management personnel will be added to supplement the current management team.
Existing Customers and Relationships
 Kaleyra believes its deep customer relationships provide it with the opportunity to expand deployment of the Platform and the opportunity to quickly deploy new communications service offerings.
Growth Strategy
 Kaleyra’s organic growth focuses on three core areas:
  
• | Exploiting cross-sale opportunities among Kaleyra’s recent acquisitions—in this area, Kaleyra focuses on growing existing product teams, accelerating joint product management and growing key technology integrations with industry leading independent software vendors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product evolution—in this area, Kaleyra works to enhance and expand features such as RCS and PSD2; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Geographic expansion—in this area, Kaleyra focuses on entering new markets such as South East Asia and Latin America.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Furthermore, mergers and acquisitions remain a key component of Kaleyra’s growth strategy. As it has in the past with its acquisitions of Solutions Infini and Buc Mobile, Kaleyra has continuously explored the global market with the intention to evaluate and acquire additional companies that are adding significant value from technology and product perspectives, and are accretive in terms of revenue, net income and capitalization. Kaleyra intends to execute acquisitions in the least dilutive and most cost-effective manner, using cash from its balance sheet or other sources, equity or a combination of both.
 Competition
 The CPaaS market is highly competitive and characterized by continuous technological change. The principal competitive factors in this market include: completeness of offering, credibility with developers, global reach, ease of integration, product features, platform scalability, brand reputation and awareness, customer support, and the cost of deployment of product offerings. Kaleyra believes that it competes favorably within each of these categories.
 Kaleyra competes with several vendors across its various product lines, including:
  
• | Legacy on-premises vendors, such as Avaya Holdings Corp., Cisco Systems, Inc., and SAP SE;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct competitors, such as CLX Communications AB (d/b/a Sinch), Twilio Inc., and Vonage Holdings Corp.;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Smaller software companies that compete with certain portions of Kaleyra’s communications services offerings; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SaaS companies that offer prepackaged applications for a narrow set of use cases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name and brand recognition, larger sales and marketing efforts and larger portfolios of intellectual property. As a result, certain competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing technologies, opportunities, standards or customer needs and requests. With the introduction of new products and services and new market entrants, Kaleyra expects competition to intensify in the future. Furthermore, as Kaleyra continues to expand the scope of its platform, it may face additional competition. Kaleyra is also addressing enterprises that have developed over the years “in-house” products for which Kaleyra can offer a more cost-effective, robust and richer set of products to enhance the total cost of ownership and return on investment for such customers.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, Kaleyra has 267 employees, of which 130 were in research and development, 93 were in sales, marketing and business development and 44 were in general and administrative. None of Kaleyra’s employees are currently covered under any collective bargaining agreements. Kaleyra believes its relations with its employees are good and it has never experienced a material work stoppage.
Facilities
 Kaleyra leases 14 properties, with its headquarters in Milan, Italy. Kaleyra maintains a global footprint with additional leased facilities located in Vienna, Virginia; New York, New York; Palo Alto, California, Bengaluru, India; Chennai, India; Cochin, India; Delhi, India; Hyderabad, India; Kolkata, India; Mumbai, India; Singapore; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and Manno, Switzerland. Kaleyra believes that its current facilities are adequate to meet its ongoing needs and that, if it requires adjusted or additional space, it will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms, or further consolidate facilities. Going forward, Kaleyra will continue to assess its facilities requirements and make appropriate adjustments as needed and dictated by the business.
 Kaleyra operates 31 data centers, including cloud platforms operated by Amazon Web Services, and Kaleyra maintains private clouds on behalf of its customers. The Kaleyra private cloud devices are custom-built hardware running the Kaleyra platform and, thus, can be deployed virtually anywhere. Kaleyra currently runs these private cloud devices out of its headquarters in Milan, Italy.
 Intellectual Property
 Kaleyra relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U. S. and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect Kaleyra’s proprietary technology. In addition, Kaleyra protects intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires its employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on its behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on its behalf are Kaleyra’s property, and assigning to Kaleyra any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.

• | Kaleyra, as of December 31, 2019, has been issued 2 patents in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Kaleyra’s trademark and certain variations thereof are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications in the U.S. In addition to the Kaleyra trademark, Kaleyra has 18 additional trademark registrations or pending registrations in three different classes with the following authorities/countries: EU, India, South Africa, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, and the International Bureau (WIPO) China, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Kaleyra owns an Internet domain registration for kaleyra.com and certain other domains.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Kaleyra generally controls access and the use of its proprietary software and other confidential information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. Unauthorized parties may, nonetheless, still copy or otherwise obtain and use Kaleyra’s software and technology despite Kaleyra’s efforts to protect its trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory
 Kaleyra is subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to its business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which Kaleyra is subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm its business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which Kaleyra operates. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that it or its communications services or the Platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.

In addition, as Kaleyra expands internationally, it will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which it offers services. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU member states, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) obtained from individuals located in the EU or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction, which are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of PII that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, telephone numbers, message addresses and, in some jurisdictions, IP addresses and other online identifiers.
 For example, in April 2016 the EU adopted General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which took full effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR enhances data protection obligations for businesses and requires service providers (data processors) processing personal data on behalf of customers to cooperate with European data protection authorities, implement security measures and keep records of personal data processing activities. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines equal to or greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual revenues. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, preparing to meet the requirements of GDPR has required significant time and resources, including a review of Kaleyra’s technology and systems currently in use against the requirements of GDPR. There are also additional EU laws and regulations (and member states’ implementations thereof) which govern the protection of consumers and of electronic communications.
 Furthermore, outside of the EU, Kaleyra continues to see increased regulation of data privacy and security, including the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific state laws in the U.S. For example, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation.
 Kaleyra is subject to individual or joint jurisdiction of the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general with respect to privacy and data security obligations. If Kaleyra was to suffer or if one of Kaleyra’s customers were to suffer a breach, Kaleyra may be subject to the jurisdiction of a variety of federal agencies’ jurisdictions as well as state attorneys general. Kaleyra may have to comply with a variety of data breach laws at the federal and state levels, comply with any resulting investigations, as well as offer mitigation to customers and potential end users of certain customers to which Kaleyra provides services. Kaleyra could also be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties that may adversely impact Kaleyra’s business.
 As Kaleyra continues to expand internationally, Kaleyra has become subject to telecommunications laws and regulations in the foreign countries where Kaleyra offers its products. Kaleyra’s international operations are subject to country-specific governmental regulation and related actions that have increased and may continue to increase Kaleyra’s costs or impact its products and platform or prevent Kaleyra from offering or providing Kaleyra’s products in certain countries.
 For example, in Italy, Kaleyra holds a license to be a fixed line operator and is subject to the Electronic Communications Code, or the ECC, which has been enacted with Legislative Decree no. 259/2003, as amended, which transposed a package of European Directives adopted in 2002 and amended in 2009; the National Numbering Plan, issued with AGCom’s resolution no. 8/15/CIR as amended, which governs the usage of national numbers for the provision of electronic communications services as a whole; resolutions on the use of alphanumeric indications for the identification of the calling subject in SMS (so-called Alias), that are periodically issued by AGCom, starting from AGCom’s resolution no. 42/13/CIR; and the GDPR (UE Decree 2016/679).
 In addition, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) restricts telemarketing and the use of automatic text messages without proper consent. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If Kaleyra does not comply with these laws, or regulations or if Kaleyra becomes liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of its customers to comply with these laws by obtaining proper consent, Kaleyra could face direct liability.

The Federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM Act) establishes certain requirements for commercial messages and transactional messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. Among other things, the CAN-SPAM Act, obligates the sender of commercial messages to provide recipients with the ability to “opt-out” of receiving future commercial communications from the sender. In addition, some states have passed laws regulating commercial communication practices that are significantly more restrictive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act. For example, Utah and Michigan prohibit the sending of communication messages that advertise products or services that minors are prohibited by law from purchasing (e.g., alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, illegal drugs) or that contain content harmful to minors (e.g., pornography) to message addresses listed on specified child protection registries. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act. In addition, certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada, and the EU, have enacted laws that regulate sending messages, and some of these laws are more restrictive than U.S. laws. For example, some foreign laws prohibit sending broad categories of messages unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such messages, or in other words has “opted-in” to receiving such communication. If Kaleyra were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws governing messages not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act or foreign laws regulating the distribution of messages, whether as a result of violations by Kaleyra’s customers or its own acts or omissions, Kaleyra could be required to pay large penalties, which would adversely affect its financial condition, significantly harm Kaleyra’s business, injure Kaleyra’s reputation and erode customer trust. The terms of any injunctions, judgments, consent decrees or settlement agreements entered into in connection with enforcement actions or investigations against Kaleyra in connection with any of the foregoing laws may also require Kaleyra to change one or more aspects of the way Kaleyra operates its business, which could impair Kaleyra’s ability to attract and retain customers or could increase its operating costs.
 In addition, in order to procure, distribute and retain telephone numbers from the EU or certain other regions, Kaleyra may be required to register with the local telecommunications regulatory authorities, some of which have been increasingly monitoring and regulating the categories of phone numbers that are eligible for provisioning to Kaleyra’s customers. Kaleyra has registered and is in the process of registering in various countries in which Kaleyra does business, but in some countries, the regulatory regime around provisioning of phone numbers is unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Furthermore, these regulations and governments’ approach to their enforcement, as well as Kaleyra’s products and services, are still evolving and Kaleyra may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, or enforce compliance by Kaleyra’s customers, on a timely basis or without significant cost. Also, compliance with these types of regulation may require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue.
 Additionally, certain of Kaleyra’s products and services may be subject to export control and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of Kaleyra’s products and the provision of Kaleyra’s services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations.
