ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Capstead Mortgage Corporation operates as a self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes and is based in Dallas, Texas.  Unless the context otherwise indicates, Capstead Mortgage Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as “Capstead” or the “Company.”  Capstead was incorporated in the state of Maryland in 1985 and its common and Series E preferred stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “CMO” and “CMOPRE,” respectively.
 Capstead’s investment strategy involves managing and earning a financing spread on a leveraged portfolio of residential mortgage pass-through securities currently consisting primarily of adjustable-rate mortgage (“ARM”) securities issued and guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or by an agency of the federal government, Ginnie Mae.  Together, these securities are referred to as “Agency Securities,” and are considered to have limited, if any, credit risk.  This strategy differentiates Capstead from its peers because ARM loans underlying its investment portfolio can reset to more current interest rates within a relatively short period of time.  This positions the Company to benefit from a potential recovery in financing spreads that typically contract during periods of rising interest rates and can result in smaller fluctuations in portfolio values compared to portfolios containing a significant amount of fixed-rate mortgage securities.  
 For further discussion of the Company’s business and financial condition, see Item 7 of this report, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is incorporated herein by reference.
 Competition
 As a residential mortgage REIT that focuses primarily on investing in ARM Agency Securities, Capstead competes for the acquisition of suitable investments with other mortgage REITs, commercial banks, insurance companies, and institutional investors such as private equity funds, mutual funds, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.  Many of these entities have lower yield requirements as well as greater financial resources and access to capital than the Company.  Increased competition for the acquisition of Agency Securities can result in higher pricing levels for such assets.  In addition, the availability of ARM Agency Securities for purchase in the secondary markets varies substantially with changes in market conditions and ARM origination levels, which have not kept pace with related runoff in recent years.  Although higher pricing levels generally correspond to a higher book value per common share for the Company, higher prices paid for acquisitions can adversely affect portfolio yields and future profitability.

Regulation and Related Matters
 Operating as an internally-managed REIT investing in Agency Securities subjects Capstead to various federal tax and regulatory requirements.

The Company’s basis for hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement at the Company is qualifications, skills, performance and experience. The Company’s compensation program is designed to attract and retain talent and the Company continually assesses and strives to enhance employee satisfaction and engagement.

In particular, the impact of COVID-19 on fluctuations in interest rates and levels of mortgage prepayments, liquidity of secondary markets and credit markets, including the availability of financing at reasonable levels and terms to support investing on a leveraged basis, and changes in general economic conditions, are especially unclear at this time. Given this unprecedented uncertainty, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements included herein. In addition to the above considerations, actual results and liquidity are affected by other risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to be significantly different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements included herein.  It is not possible to identify all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results.  In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed herein may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.
