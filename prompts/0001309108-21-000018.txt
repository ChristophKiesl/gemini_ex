ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
    WEX Inc. is a leading financial technology service provider having simplified the complexities of payment systems across continents and industries. We currently operate in three reportable segments: Fleet Solutions, Travel and Corporate Solutions, and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions, which are described in more detail below. The Company’s U.S. operations include WEX Inc., the majority-owned U.S. Health business (currently consisting of WEX Health and Discovery Benefits), and our wholly-owned subsidiaries WEX Bank, WEX FleetOne, Noventis and EFS. Our international operations include our wholly-owned operations including, WEX Fuel Cards Australia, WEX Prepaid Cards Australia, WEX Canada, WEX Asia, WEX Europe Limited, WEX Fleet Europe, and eNett and Optal and their respective operating subsidiaries, and a controlling interest in WEX Europe Services Limited and its subsidiaries.
    WEX Bank, a Utah industrial bank incorporated in 1998, is an FDIC insured depository institution. The functions performed at WEX Bank contribute to the U.S. and Canadian operations of Fleet Solutions and the majority of operations of Travel and Corporate Solutions by providing a funding mechanism, among other services. With our ownership of WEX Bank, we have access to low-cost sources of capital. WEX Bank raises capital primarily through the issuance of brokered deposit accounts and provides the financing and makes credit decisions that enable the Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments to extend credit to customers. WEX Bank approves customer applications, maintains appropriate credit lines for each customer, is the account issuer, and is the counterparty for the customer relationships for most of our programs in the U.S. Operations such as sales, marketing, merchant relations, customer service, software development and IT are performed as a service within our organization but outside of WEX Bank. WEX Bank’s primary regulators are Utah DFI and the FDIC. The activities performed by WEX Bank are integrated into the operations of our Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments. The relationship between WEX Inc. and WEX Bank is governed under a master service agreement, which establishes the parameters of the services described above.
Recent Developments
Acquisition of eNett and Optal
On January 24, 2020, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to purchase eNett, a leading provider of B2B payments solutions to the travel industry, and Optal, a company that specializes in optimizing B2B transactions, for an aggregate purchase price comprised of $1.3 billion in cash and 2.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to customary closing conditions, including the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the purchase agreement between WEX, eNett and Optal, among others). The Company concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic and conditions arising in connection with it had a Material Adverse Effect on the eNett and Optal businesses, disproportionate to the effect on others 
in the relevant industry. Because of this Material Adverse Effect, WEX formally advised eNett and Optal on May 4, 2020 that it was not required to close the transaction pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement. On May 11, 2020, the shareholders of eNett and Optal each initiated separate legal proceedings in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in the United Kingdom against the Company seeking a declaration that no Material Adverse Effect had occurred and an order for specific performance of WEX's obligations under the purchase agreement. From September 21, 2020 through September 29, 2020, a London court held a trial of certain preliminary issues. On October 12, 2020, the Court handed down its judgment, which concluded, among other things, that the Optal and eNett Groups operate in the payments industry and the B2B payments industry and that, for the purpose of the definition of the Material Adverse Effect clause, the relevant industry is the B2B payments industry. The Court found that there was no travel payments industry, as argued for by eNett and Optal. This finding meant that when determining whether eNett or Optal have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, a comparison would be made against other B2B payments companies. The Company and the claimants each sought permission to appeal certain portions of the Court’s judgment. 
On December 15, 2020, the Company entered into a Deed of Settlement (the “Settlement Deed”) with eNett, Optal and the other parties thereto providing for, among other things, (i) the dismissal with prejudice of the legal proceedings and appeals described above, (ii) the amendment of original purchase agreement and (iii) the release of all claims capable of arising out of, or in any way connected with or relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, but excluding any claims arising under the amended purchase agreement. The closing of the acquisition occurred concurrent with the execution of the Settlement Deed on December 15, 2020. The amended purchase agreement provided for, among other things, a reduction of the aggregate purchase price for the acquisition to $577.5 million (subject to certain adjustments) consisting entirely of cash, which the company paid with cash on hand, and the closing of the acquisition occurring concurrent with the execution of the Settlement Deed on December 15, 2020. The Company determined the aggregate purchase price represents consideration paid for the businesses acquired and for the settlement of legal proceedings described above. The preliminary fair value of the businesses acquired was estimated to be $415.0 million using a discounted cash flow analysis and guideline transaction method. Since the Company was not able to reliably estimate the fair value of the legal settlement, the residual value of $162.5 million has been allocated to the legal proceedings settlement, which has been included in legal settlement expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Sale of Subsidiary
On September 30, 2020, the Company sold its wholly-owned subsidiary UNIK S.A, (the "WEX Latin America" business). The operations of WEX Latin America were primarily included in the Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment through the date of sale. A pre-tax loss on sale of subsidiary of $46.4 million, has been reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company decided to sell UNIK S.A. because it no longer aligned with the strategic direction of the Company.
FLEET SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
    Our Fleet Solutions segment is a leader in fleet vehicle payment processing services specifically designed for the needs of large fleets, government fleets, over-the-road carriers and small businesses. As of December 31, 2020, 15.8 million vehicles use our payment solutions for fleet management.
Sales 
    Payment processing transactions are the primary revenue source in Fleet Solutions and are based on a percentage of the aggregate dollar amount of the customer’s purchase, a fixed amount per transaction or a combination of both. Normally, in a domestic payment processing transaction, we extend short-term credit to the fleet cardholder and pay the merchant within ten days, on average, for the purchase price, less the fees we retain and record as revenue. Revenue from our WEX Europe Services and Go Fuel Card operations is primarily derived from the difference between the negotiated price of the fuel from the supplier and the price charged to the fleet customer. In both types of transactions, we collect the total purchase price from the fleet customer, normally within 25 days from the billing date. In 2020, we processed approximately 464 million payment processing transactions, compared to approximately 505 million payment processing transactions in 2019.    

The following illustration depicts our business process for a typical closed-loop domestic fuel payment processing transaction and a breakdown of the related Fleet Solutions revenue streams:
    At the point-of-sale, we capture an array of information including the amount of the expenditure, the driver, the vehicle, the odometer reading, the fuel or vehicle maintenance provider and the items purchased. We provide standard and customized information to customers through monthly vehicle analysis reports, custom reports and our websites. We also alert customers of unusual transactions or transactions that fall outside of pre-established parameters. Customers can access their account information through our website including account history and recent transactions and download the related details. In addition, fleet managers can elect to be notified by email when limits are exceeded in specified purchase categories, including limits on transactions within a time range and gallons per day. 
    In the over-the-road space, we offer customizable payment solutions including real-time interactive and seamless interfaces delivering data integrity, alternative payment and money transfer options, comprehensive settlement solutions, real-time reports and analytics for compliance and cost-optimization and fuel reconciliation and mobile optimization tools.
    In addition to revenue derived from payment processing transactions, we recognize account servicing revenue, finance fee revenue and other revenue through the following products and services: 
•Customer service, account activation and account retention: We offer customer service, account activation and account retention services to fleets, fleet management companies and the fuel and vehicle maintenance providers on our network. Our services include promoting the adoption and use of our products and programs and account retention programs on behalf of our customers and partners. 
•Authorization and billing inquiries and account maintenance: We handle authorization and billing questions, account changes and other issues for fleets through our dedicated customer contact centers, which are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Fleet customers also have self-service options available to them through our websites. 
•Premium fleet services: We assign designated account managers to businesses and government agencies with large fleets. These representatives have in-depth knowledge of both our programs and the operations and objectives of the fleets they service. 
•Credit and collections services: We have developed proprietary account approval, credit management and fraud detection programs. Our underwriting model produces a proprietary score, which we use to predict the likelihood of an account becoming delinquent at application and on an ongoing basis. We have developed a collections scoring model that we use to rank and prioritize past due accounts for collection activities. We also employ fraud specialists who monitor accounts, alert customers and provide case management expertise to minimize losses and reduce program abuse. 
•Merchant services: Our representatives work with fuel and vehicle maintenance providers to enroll these providers in our network, test all network and terminal software and hardware, and to provide training on our sale, transaction authorization and settlement processes. 
•Analytics solutions: We provide customers with access to web-based data analytics platforms and custom reporting tools that offer insights to fleet managers, including integrating and analyzing business fleet fuel purchases to uncover fraud, manage product type controls and identify cost saving opportunities. 
•Ancillary services and offerings: We provide a variety of ancillary services and tools to fleets to help them better manage expenses and capital requirements including tracking driver performance, location and speed; mobile account maintenance and payment tools; tax reporting and permitting services.
Marketing Channels 
    We market our fleet products and services both directly and indirectly to commercial and government vehicle fleet customers with small, medium and large fleets, and over-the-road, long haul fleets. Our direct product suite includes payment processing and transaction processing services, WEX branded fleet cards in North America and Motorpass/Motorcharge-branded fleet cards in Australia. Additionally, our over-the-road line of business is marketed under the EFS, EFS Transportation Services, T-Chek and Fleet One brands. 
    We also market our products and services indirectly through co-branded and private label relationships. With a co-branded relationship product, we market our products and services for, and in collaboration with, both fuel providers and fleet management companies using their brand names and our logo on a co-branded fleet card. These companies seek to offer our payment processing and information management services as a component of their total offering to their fleet customers. 
    Our private label programs market our products and services for, and in collaboration with, fuel retailers, using only their brand names. The fuel retailers with which we have formed strategic relationships offer our payment processing and information management products and services to their fleet customers in order to establish and enhance customer loyalty. These fleets use these products and services to purchase fuel at locations of the fuel retailer with whom we have the private label relationship. 
TRAVEL AND CORPORATE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
    Our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment provides innovative corporate purchasing and payment capabilities that can be integrated with our customers’ internal systems to streamline their corporate payments, accounts payable and reconciliation processes. 
Sales
    The Travel and Corporate Solutions segment allows businesses to centralize purchasing, simplify complex supply chain processes and eliminate the paper check writing associated with traditional purchase order programs. Our product suite includes electronic payments and corporate cards offered across travel, insurance & warranty and other industries. 
    Our electronic payments product includes virtual payments and integrated payables. Our virtual payments program is used for transactions where no physical card is presented, including transactions conducted over the telephone, by mail, by fax or on the Internet or for transactions that require pre-authorization, such as hotel reservations. Under our virtual payments program, each transaction is assigned a unique account number with a customized credit limit and expiration date. These controls are in place to limit fraud and unauthorized spending. The unique account number limits purchase amounts and tracks, settles and reconciles purchases more easily, creating efficiencies and cost savings for our customers. Our electronic accounts payable solution is a cloud-based web platform that manages and optimizes all accounts payable disbursements, regardless of type. Automated clearing house, virtual cards, electronic funds transfer and check payments are streamlined and automated through our centralized application.
    We offer a variety of corporate cards, designed to combine all of a customer’s purchasing needs into a single integrated card, streamline the procure-to-pay process with a single card and control travel and entertainment spending and provide employees with greater flexibility.
    Additionally, WEX Prepaid Card Australia offers prepaid and gift card products, which provide secure payment and financial management solutions with single card options, access to open or closed loop redemption, load limits and variable expirations.

The following illustration depicts our business process for a typical travel virtual card product transaction:
 1  Guest books a hotel through a travel website owned by an online travel company
 2  Online travel company reserves room at hotel through reservation system using a WEX VCN to reserve the room 
 3  Upon checkout, hotel authorizes payment using the WEX VPN
 4  The WEX virtual card restricts charge to predetermined cost of room and incidental expenses are paid for by guest
 5  Online travel company pays WEX. WEX earns fee by retaining percentage of the online travel company reimbursement payment
Marketing Channels 
    We market our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment products and services both directly and indirectly to new and existing customers. Our products are marketed to commercial and government organizations and we use existing open-loop networks. 
HEALTH AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
    Our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment is comprised of our healthcare payment products and SaaS platforms with which we provide simplified payment capabilities in a complex healthcare market.
Sales
    Our healthcare payment products provide consumer-directed payments in the complex healthcare market. We partner with employers, health plans, third-party administrators, financial institutions, payroll companies and the public sector to provide a SaaS product to support healthcare benefit programs and administer COBRA, flexible spending, health saving and reimbursement accounts, and other healthcare related employee and dependent benefits. 
    We currently have relationships with approximately 408,000 employers, reaching approximately 33.1 million consumers. Revenue is generated primarily from SasS licensing fees charged to partners and interchange fees from spending on customer debit cards issued under flexible spending, health savings and reimbursement accounts. Cards are branded with either Visa or MasterCard and operate on a restricted open loop network.
    Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment revenues are generated primarily from subscription fees and interchange fees from spending on the WEX Health payment cards.

The following illustration depicts our business process and parties involved in our healthcare benefits solution:
BPO: Business Process Outsourcing
Marketing Channels 
    We market our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions products and services to consumers through an extensive partner network, which includes health plans, third-party administrators, financial institutions, payroll companies and software providers, as well as individual employer groups.
OTHER ITEMS 
Markets 
    We face competition in all of our segments. Our competitors vie with us for prospective customers as well as for companies with which to form strategic relationships. The most significant competitive factors include the breadth of features offered, functionality, servicing capability and price. We compete with companies that perform payment and transaction processing or similar services. Financial institutions that issue Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit and specialized proprietary cards currently compete primarily with our Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments. Our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment also competes with other healthcare payment service providers. For more information regarding risks related to competition, see the information in Item 1A, under the heading “Our industry continues to become increasingly competitive, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain profit margins at historical levels.”
The demand for our payment processing, account servicing and transaction processing services combined with significant operating scale has historically driven strong revenue growth and earnings potential. We have an extensive history of organic revenue growth driven by our various marketing channels, our extensive network of fuel and service providers, and our growth in transaction volume. Further, we have completed a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our product and service offerings, which have contributed to our revenue growth and diversification of our products and services. We have an experienced and committed management team that has substantial industry knowledge and a proven track record of financial success. The team has been successful in driving strong growth with consistent operating performance. We believe that our management team positions us well to continue successfully implementing our growth strategy and capturing operating efficiencies. In addition, we believe that the following factors, by reportable segment, distinguish us from our competitors and place us in a strong competitive position.
Fleet Solutions
•Our proprietary closed-loop fuel networks in the U.S. and Australia are among the largest in each country. We describe our fleet payment processing networks as “closed-loop” because we have a direct contractual relationship with both the merchant and the fleet, and only WEX transactions can be processed on these networks. We have built networks that management estimates provide coverage to over 90 percent of fuel locations in the U.S. and Australia, as well as wide acceptance in Europe. This provides our customers with the convenience of broad acceptance.
•Our proprietary closed-loop fuel networks provide us with access to a higher level of fleet-specific information and control as compared to what is typically available on an open-loop network. This provides high-level purchase controls at the point-of-sale, including the flexibility of allowing fleets to restrict purchases and receive automated alerts. Additionally, we have the ability to refine the reporting provided to our fleet customers and customers of our strategic relationships.
•We offer a differentiated set of products and services, including security and purchase controls, to allow our customers and the customers of our strategic relationships to better manage their vehicle fleets. We provide customized analysis and reporting on the efficiency of fleet vehicles and the purchasing behavior of fleet vehicle drivers. We make this data available to fleet customers through both traditional reporting services and sophisticated web-based data analytics tools. 
•Our long-standing strategic relationships, multi-year contracts and high contract renewal rates have contributed to the stability and recurring nature of our revenue base. We believe that we offer a compelling value to our customers relative to our competitors given the breadth and quality of our products and services and our deep understanding of our customers’ operational needs. We have a large installed customer base and co-branded strategic relationships with some of the largest U.S. fleet management providers and with various oil companies and convenience store operators that use our private label solutions. Our wide site acceptance, together with our private-label portfolios and value-added product and service offerings, drive high customer satisfaction levels, as evidence by high customer retention rates. 
•Our capabilities in the over-the-road market space enhance our ability to serve fleet customers who operate both heavy duty trucks and cars or light duty vehicles in the U.S. and Canada as well as to blend the small fleet and private label businesses for greater scale.
•Our European commercial fuel card programs, which use a closed-loop network, combined with long term supply agreements to serve the current and future European Fleet business, provides us with a strong foundation in the large European fleet market.
Travel and Corporate Solutions
•Our travel and corporate payment products offer customers enhanced security and control for complex payment needs and the accounts payable segment of the market. Our strategic relationships include many of the largest online travel agencies in the world. We continue to expand our online travel payment solution capabilities and geographies, which currently include North America, South America, the United Kingdom, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia/New Zealand. As of December 31, 2020, we settle transactions in over 20 currencies. 
Health and Employee Benefit Solutions
•The U.S. Health business uses an industry leading proprietary cloud-based platform to simplify healthcare benefits administration for employers and consumers. We provide a comprehensive suite of products and services that can be customized to fit the needs of the complex healthcare space. As a result of this complete solution, which distinguishes us from competitors, we have high customer retention rates. Our large partner network expands our opportunities in the healthcare financial technology market and solidifies our strong competitive position.
Another factor that places us in a strong competitive position is that we have an enterprise-wide risk management program that helps us identify and manage inherent risks related to our liquidity, extension of credit and interest rates. Our ownership of WEX Bank provides us with access to low cost sources of capital, which provide liquidity to fund our short-term card receivables. We have maintained a long record of low credit losses due to the short-term, non-revolving credit issued to our customer base. Our credit risk management program is enhanced by our proprietary scoring models, managing credit lines and early suspension policy. Interest rate risk is managed through diversified funding sources at WEX Bank including interest bearing money market deposits and certificates of deposit with varying maturities. Some of our merchant contracts provide the ability to raise rates if interest rates rise.
Strategy
The Company’s performance during the year ended December 31, 2020, was shaped by a newly updated corporate strategy and the global COVID pandemic. While we continue to prioritize customers, technology, talent, and execution, we refined our strategy to more specifically focus on how we will meet the needs of an evolving landscape. 
•Continue to Win & Expand Using Customer Relationships. We seek to drive organic growth across our segments by nurturing our customer relationships and ensuring we are a trusted strategic partner. We have successfully integrated the two major oil wins and those portfolios are continuing to perform well. Our industry-leading support and service will enable us to grow with existing customers and win new customers.
•Deliver Modular Solutions on Integrated Platforms. We will focus on differentiating ourselves by anticipating our customers’ technology needs and providing innovative offerings. We will do this through integrating and continuously improving our payment platforms and by embedding intelligence, agility, and resiliency everywhere across the organization.
•Continuously Reinvent Through Diversification. As global markets continue to evolve, we will minimize our exposure to macro forces and customer concentration. We will accomplish this by identifying new verticals, business models, and geographies for expansion. Along with our organic growth, we will achieve this with our acquisition strategy, which brings further scale and diversification to our offerings. In December, we closed the acquisition of eNett and Optal, which complements our existing travel business by expanding our presence in Europe and entering into new markets in Asia.
•Transform to Mitigate Risk & Maximize Scale. To drive efficiency, we will optimize operations by improving technological capabilities and risk management. To accomplish this, we will maximize the value of shared services, streamline and standardize our technologies, and automate wherever possible. This year we built out a new data team and platform to optimize our operations and identify new ways to drive growth. We will expand our use of AI, machine learning, and other innovative tools to ensure we can scale with our growth and further mature our risk management.
•Leverage Our Culture & Grow Our Talent. Through leveraging our winning, inclusive, and values-based culture, we will mine, grow, and maximize talent that adapts to our future business. During the pandemic, the safety and health of our employees have taken on even more importance. We have made significant technology investments to rapidly support our remote workforce, we gave all US employees an additional two weeks of paid time off to allow for personal time away from “the office”, and we leveraged our Compassion Fund to help both furloughed and active employees. We have also invested in our Diversity and Inclusion efforts including the launch of various employee resource groups to support our current employees and develop a culture of inclusion to attract new talent. One of the benefits of supporting the remote workforce is that we can now recruit from more diverse geographies.
Human Capital
We believe that maintaining our continued growth and position as a leading provider of financial technology solutions requires a strategy focused on attracting, developing and retaining exceptional talent, as well as fostering a culture that supports innovation and collaboration globally. Each of our employees contributes to our growth and success. As of December 31, 2020, WEX Inc. and its subsidiaries had approximately 5,300 employees, of which approximately 4,300 were located in the United States. None of our U.S.-based employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Certain non U.S.-based employees are members of trade unions or works councils. 
Values
We believe our core values of Community, Execution, Innovation, Integrity and Relationships differentiate us from our competitors and meaningfully contribute to our growth and business success.
Operating with transparency and authenticity is of the utmost importance, internally and externally. Collaboration across the organization, a culture of curiosity and respectful communication support the development and retention of superior talent and the growth of our business. For WEX, it’s all about the people.
Along with being a growth-focused company, we take pride in prioritizing and maintaining a positive corporate environment where WEX employees enjoy their work, respect and support their colleagues and are encouraged to innovate and collaborate. We strive to foster a culture where our employees recognize the value of their contributions—and of our business—to support the growth and development of the communities in which we operate.
Talent Management Focused on Recruitment, Development and Retention
We believe that attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team are of paramount importance to the success of our organization, including meeting or exceeding our business and growth goals. The skills, experience, institutional and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance.
There are several ways in which we attract, develop, and retain highly qualified talent. Here is an overview on key programs at WEX that support each of these pillars: 
•In line with our values, we encourage creativity and innovation and regularly reinforce the importance of integrity and respectful communication. 
•We strategically recruit diverse, qualified candidates to help support our culture of innovation and fostering creativity. We support our talent pipeline through internships, co-ops, and partnerships with universities. 
•In addition, we collaborate with a broad range of organizations to introduce us to qualified diverse candidates.
•We provide competitive and valuable Total Rewards benefits that help our employees thrive while protecting what is most important: health, families and overall well-being. Our Total Rewards program consists of five elements: social; health; community; financial; and career, and is designed to support employees in reaching their personal and professional goals. We offer market-competitive compensation packages as well as a variety of benefits through our Total Rewards program, including a 401(k) employer match, incentive-based cash and/or equity based compensation awards, company-subsidized medical insurance coverage, recognition programs, paid volunteer time off, and paid time off, among other benefits. 
•We provide employees with comprehensive training programs, tools and education throughout their employment with us, including online self-service learning platforms, professional development, leadership and mentoring programs, wellness challenges, incentives to foster community and engagement, dedicated well-being campaigns and personal financial counseling.
•Through our Great Leader Behaviors, employees are provided a baseline of behaviors and qualities to embody in their daily interactions with colleagues, customers and partners. We believe it’s not just what we do, but how we do it that matters, and our Great Leader pillars lay the foundation for clear and consistent behavior at all levels. In turn, we are better able to maintain an inclusive, innovative and collaborative environment for all employees to work, live and thrive.
•We do not limit equity awards to our senior leadership; employees at different levels throughout our organization are eligible to receive equity awards as part of their annual compensation, including a number of individual contributors. Equity compensation supports retention of key employees and further aligns the interests of those individuals with those of our stockholders. We operate in a highly competitive talent marketplace, and our approach to equity compensation supports WEX having the right people in the right roles at the right time to achieve our short- and long-term goals.
•Our leadership recognizes that small tweaks in processes or in the way we engage with employees or customers can lead to big successes. We believe in continuous improvement and regularly evaluate, and consider potential enhancements to, our internal processes and technologies to support and increase employee engagement, productivity and efficiency.
•One way we capture employee feedback is employee surveys, which measures cultural and engagement indicators.
•We regularly review talent retention at different levels of our organization relative to expectation, over-time trends and market norms.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At WEX, we strive to achieve a fully inclusive global workplace that unifies and celebrates the diversity of our people, and this is embedded in our core values. We believe that to fully realize our potential as a company, we must continue to foster a workplace that ignites a sense of belonging and provides equal opportunities and treatment for our employees. We embed diversity and inclusion as a business imperative because we believe the best solutions happen when all individuals are treated fairly and respectfully, have equal access to opportunities and resources and can contribute fully to our organization’s success.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is shown in many ways, including:
•Our blend of managers comes from both homegrown talent and from outside the company, and leveraging talent internally and from companies we have acquired. Our leaders hail from businesses large and small, and bring a diversity of thought and approach to WEX.
•We furthered our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion during 2020 by expanding the responsibilities section of the charter for the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to specifically include providing direction and perspective to management on key diversity initiatives, among other strategies, policies and practices with significant human resource implications. 
•As part of WEX’s commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace, we proudly sponsor employee resource groups (ERGs) that focus on, among other employee groups: early career professionals; parents; the LGBTQIA+ community; women; employees of color, employees with differing abilities; and multicultural employee interests. ERGs are part of our larger commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and our long-term strategy of commitment to maintain an inclusive community. They serve as a key diversity tool in facilitating the recruitment of minority staff, raising diversity awareness across the company and driving strategic discussions about the advancement of employees and a more inclusive workplace. We continue to sponsor newly formed groups and employees are encouraged to form groups to satisfy their individual needs.
•Including our chair and CEO, nearly one-third of the members of our board are women, and 40 percent of our executive leadership team are women. Women, who are a key part of WEX’s business at all levels, represent nearly half of our global workforce. 
Employee Health and Safety
We are committed to protecting the safety, health and well-being of our employees, contractors and visitors to our office locations and to ensuring compliance with local health and safety regulations. The health and safety of our employees has been—and continues to be—of vital importance amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. In early 2020, we implemented a COVID-19 global task force to prioritize our pandemic response. Operating on the task force’s recommendation, we pivoted to a remote work environment in March 2020 and instituted a series of employee-focused initiatives, such as increasing flexibility on when and where we work, adding an additional 10 days of emergency time off and expanding child- and elder-care benefits. As the pandemic continues, we remain committed to developing a staged plan for global office reentry when safe to do so. In 2020, we also expanded the criteria of the WEX Cares Foundation, funded by employees and the WEX Board of Directors, to include support for employees severely impacted by COVID-19 hardships.
We continue to provide frequent communications and information to our employees through a dedicated Chief Human Resource Officer COVID-19 newsletter series, town hall meetings, an internal COVID-19 Google Site and external website page, all with the goal of keeping our employees, customers, partners, and communities healthy, safe and informed.
Technology
    We believe that investment in technology is crucial in maintaining and enhancing our competitive position in the marketplace. Our technology infrastructure is supported by secure and redundant data centers and cloud services distributed globally, including locations in the United States, Europe, Australia and Singapore. 
    Our fleet fuel-based closed-loop proprietary platforms capture detailed information from the fuel and maintenance locations within our network. Operating a proprietary network not only enhances our value proposition, it also enables us to limit dependence on third-party processors and to respond rapidly to changing customer needs with system upgrades, while maintaining a more secure environment than an open-loop network typically allows. The majority of payments processed on our virtual card open-loop network are through the Company's internally developed software, while a smaller portion are processed using third-party processors. Our infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to minimize downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. At WEX Health, we maintain an integrated multi-account payment platform, including a mobile application. In Australia, Asia Pacific and the United Kingdom, we use standalone platforms to support operations. 
    Our secure networks are designed to isolate our data from unauthorized access. We use secure protocols among all applications, and our employees access critical components on a need-to-know basis. We are not aware of any material data breaches experienced by the Company during 2020. We are continually improving our technology to enhance customer experience and to increase efficiency and security. We also review technologies and services provided by others in order to maintain the high level of service expected by our customers and continue to invest in our technology infrastructure. 
    For information regarding technology related risks, see the information in Item 1A under the headings “Our business is regularly subject to cyberattacks and attempted security and privacy breaches and we may not be able to adequately protect our information systems, including the data we collect about our customers, which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation”, “Our failure to effectively implement new technology could jeopardize our position as a leader in our industry,” “We are dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks managed by third parties, which could result in our inability to prevent service disruptions” and “If the technologies we use in operating our business and interacting with our customers fail, are unavailable, or do not operate to expectations, or we fail to successfully implement technology strategies and capabilities in connection with our outsourcing arrangements, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.”
Seasonality
    Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. For example, in a typical year, fuel prices are typically higher during the summer and online travel sales are typically higher during the third quarter. In addition, we experience seasonality in our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment as consumer spend is correlated with insurance deductibles, typically resulting in higher spend in the early part of the year until employees meet their deductibles.
Resources
    We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect the proprietary information and technology used in our business. We generally enter into agreements with clients, consultants, service providers and other partners, whether current or prospective, that contain provisions restricting use and disclosure of our proprietary information and technology. Operationally, we have implemented certain safeguards designed to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information and technology. Despite these efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to access or use our proprietary information and technology, and third parties may develop similar and/or competing technology independently. We pursue registration and protection of certain trademarks in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate or plan to operate. We market our products and services using the WEX brand name globally, as well as other brand names such as Fleet One, EFS, WEX Health Cloud and Discovery Benefits in the U.S., and Motorpass in Australia. 
Regulation 
    The Company and its affiliates are subject to a substantial number of laws and regulations, both in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, which apply to businesses offering financial technology services and payment cards to customers or processing or servicing for payment cards and related accounts. In addition, a substantial number of laws and regulations govern insured depository institutions and their affiliates, such as WEX Bank, and our operations in the healthcare market. 
    The laws and regulations that apply to the Company and its affiliates are often evolving and sometimes ambiguous or inconsistent, and the extent to which they apply to us is at times unclear. Failure to comply with regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. The following, while not exhaustive, is a description of certain federal and state laws and regulations in the United States, as well as foreign laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business, and therefore can materially affect our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. In addition, the legal and regulatory framework governing our business is subject to ongoing revision, and changes in that framework could have a significant effect on us. 
Regulation - United States
Exemption from Certain Requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act 
    As an industrial bank organized under the laws of Utah that does not accept demand deposits that may be withdrawn by check or similar means, WEX Bank currently meets the criteria for exemption as an industrial bank from the definition of “bank” under the Bank Holding Company Act. As a result, the Company is generally, except as stated above, not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. 
Restrictions on Intercompany Borrowings and Transactions 
    Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and the implementing regulations limit the extent to which the Company can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other “covered transactions” with WEX Bank. “Covered transactions” include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a 
guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright ban on engaging in “covered transactions,” they do limit the amount of covered transactions WEX Bank may have with any one affiliate and with all affiliates in the aggregate. The applicable rules also require that the Company engage in such transactions with WEX Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to WEX Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by WEX Bank to the Company or its other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100 percent to 130 percent of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral. 
The Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
    The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to regulate the offering of consumer financial products or services under the federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB assumed rulemaking authority under the existing federal consumer financial protection laws, and enforces those laws against and examines certain non-depository institutions and insured depository institutions with total assets greater than $10 billion and their affiliates. In addition, the CFPB was granted general authority to prevent covered persons or service providers from committing or engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB is also engaged in regulating the payments industry, including with respect to prepaid cards. The CFPB amended several aspects of its prepaid accounts rule, which became effective on April 1, 2019. Among other things, the rule established requirements for the treatment of funds on lost or stolen cards, error resolution and investigation, upfront fee disclosures, access to account information, and overdraft features if offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts. The extensive nature of these types of regulations and the implementation dates for any such additional rulemaking may result in additional compliance obligations and expense for our business and our customers. From an enforcement perspective, the legislation also gives the state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws, expanding the sources of regulatory oversight. Relatedly, the Utah DFI is responsible for examining and supervising WEX Bank's compliance with state consumer protection laws and regulations.
    In addition, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. Payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions. In July 2011, the Federal Reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees. Effective in October 2011, with certain exemptions, debit interchange rates were capped at $0.21 per transaction with an additional component of five basis points of the transaction’s value to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuing financial institutions, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs.
The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. Compliance with derivatives regulations have added costs to our business, and any additional requirements, such as future registration requirements or increased regulation of derivative contracts, may add additional costs or may require us to change any fuel price, currency and interest rate hedging practices we may then use to comply with new regulatory requirements. Potential changes could also include clearing and execution methodology of our derivatives transactions. 
Brokered Deposits 
    As of December 31, 2020, the most recent FDIC exam report categorized WEX Bank as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Under applicable regulations, however, if WEX Bank were to be no longer categorized as "well capitalized" under such framework, it would not be able to finance its operations through the acceptance of brokered deposits without the approval of the FDIC. Moreover, in December 2020, the FDIC amended its brokered deposits regulations, effective April 1, 2021, and may in the future change the definition of brokered deposits or extend the classification to deposits not currently classified as brokered deposits.
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Regulations 
    The applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate impose significant anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence obligations on its local entities. We must verify the identity of customers, monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity, as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits, and refrain from transacting with designated persons or in designated regions, in each case as required by the applicable laws and regulations (such as the Bank Secrecy Act and regulations of the United States Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service in the United States). Financial regulators have issued various implementing regulations and have made enforcement a high priority. 
The U.S. federal government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the OFAC, take many different forms but generally include one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. We have implemented measures designed to ensure compliance with these sanctions and failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 
Privacy and Information Security Regulations
    Under the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also referred to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or GLBA, and certain state laws, we and WEX Bank are required to maintain a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to consumer information. This requirement generally does not extend to information about companies or about individuals who obtain financial products or services for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes.
 The GLBA also requires us and WEX Bank to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers that describe in general terms our information sharing practices. If we or WEX Bank intend to share nonpublic personal information about consumers with affiliates and/or nonaffiliated third parties, we and WEX Bank must provide customers with a notice and a reasonable period of time for each customer to “opt out” of any such disclosure. In addition to U.S. federal privacy laws with which we must comply, states also have adopted statutes, regulations and other measures, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), governing the collection and distribution of nonpublic personal information about customers. In some cases, these state measures are preempted by federal law, but if not, we and WEX Bank must monitor and seek to comply with individual state privacy laws in the conduct of our businesses.
FACT Act
The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act and requires creditors to adopt identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with covered accounts, which can include business accounts for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft.
Truth in Lending Act
The Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, was enacted as a consumer protection measure to increase consumer awareness of the cost of credit and to protect consumers from unauthorized charges or billing errors, and is implemented by the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Z. Most provisions of TILA and Regulation Z apply only to the extension of consumer credit, but a limited number of provisions apply to commercial cards as well. One example where TILA and Regulation Z are generally applicable is a limitation on liability for unauthorized use, although a business that acquires 10 or more credit cards for its personnel can agree to more expansive liability.
Money Transmission and Payment Instrument Licensing Regulations
We are subject to various U.S. laws and regulations governing money transmission and the issuance and sale of payment instruments relating to certain aspects of our business. In the United States, most states license money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments. Through our subsidiaries, we are licensed in all states where required for business. Many states exercise authority over the operations of our services related to money transmission and payment instruments and, as part of this authority, subject us to periodic examinations, which may include a review of our compliance practices, policies and procedures, financial position and related records, privacy and data security policies and procedures, and other matters related to our business. 
As a licensee, we are subject to certain restrictions and requirements, including net worth and surety bond requirements, record keeping and reporting requirements, requirements for regulatory approval of controlling stockholders or direct and indirect changes of control of the licensee and certain other corporate events, and requirements to maintain certain levels of permissible investments in an amount equal to our outstanding payment obligations. Many states also require money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments to comply with federal and state anti-money laundering laws and regulations. 
In addition, non-banks that provide certain financial services are required to register with FinCEN as “money services businesses” (“MSBs”). Through a subsidiary we are registered as a MSB. As a result, we have established anti-money laundering compliance programs that include: (i) internal policies and controls; (ii) designation of a compliance officer; (iii) 
ongoing employee training; and (iv) an independent review function. We have developed and implemented compliance programs comprised of policies, procedures, systems and internal controls to monitor and address various legal requirements and developments.
Government agencies may impose new or additional requirements on money transmission and sales of payment instruments, and we expect that compliance costs will increase in the future for our regulated subsidiaries.
Escheat Laws
    We are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property state laws in the United States and in certain foreign countries that require us to transfer to certain government authorities the unclaimed property of others that we hold when that property has been unclaimed for a certain period of time. Moreover, we are subject to audit by state and foreign regulatory authorities with regard to our escheatment practices.
Restrictions on Dividends 
    WEX Bank is subject to various regulatory requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. A banking regulator may determine that the payment of dividends would be inappropriate and could prohibit payment. Further, WEX Bank may not pay a dividend if it is undercapitalized or would become undercapitalized as a result of paying the dividend. Utah law permits WEX Bank to pay dividends out of the net profits of the industrial bank after providing for all expenses, losses, interest, and taxes accrued or due, but if WEX Bank’s surplus account is less than 100 percent of its capital stock, WEX Bank must transfer up to 10 percent of its net profits to the surplus account prior to the payment of any dividends. 
 Company Obligations to WEX Bank 
    Any non-deposit obligation of WEX Bank to the Company is subordinate, in right of payment, to deposits and other indebtedness of WEX Bank. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of WEX Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 
Restrictions on Ownership of WEX Inc. Common Stock 
    WEX Bank, and therefore the Company, is subject to banking regulations that impose requirements on entities that might control WEX Bank through control of the Company. These requirements are discussed in Item 1A under the heading “Provisions in our charter documents, Delaware law, applicable banking law and the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.” 
Healthcare Regulation
    The federal and state governments in the U.S. continue to enact and consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact various aspects of our health-related business. The plans that our partners administer feature consumer accounts that pay for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by employees and qualified dependents. These accounts include CDH accounts such as HSAs, FSAs and HRAs, as well as wellness incentives, commuter benefits, and other account-based arrangements. Most of these accounts are tax-advantaged under the appropriate law. 
Employers are continuing to use CDH approaches to manage the rate of increase in healthcare expenditures and to enable employees to make decisions about the use of their healthcare savings. CDH programs provide consumers with visibility into and control over payment for healthcare expenses.
The products that WEX Health’s software and payment solutions support are subject to various state and federal laws, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as “Health Care Reform”), and regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and similar state laws and regulatory authorities. As such, changes in the status of tax-advantaged CDH accounts could affect the attractiveness of these products.
    In addition to tax-related regulation, the Health Care Reform law imposes coverage standards affecting insured and self-insured health benefit plans that impact our current business model, including our relationships with current and future customers, producers and health care providers, products, services, processes and technology. Health Care Reform left many details to be established through regulations. The 2017 Tax Act repealed certain provisions of Health Care Reform, including reducing to zero the tax penalty for individuals who decline to obtain Health Care Reform-compliant healthcare coverage. Since 
the enactment of Health Care Reform, there has been persistent political pressure to significantly modify or completely repeal Health Care Reform and the associated implementing regulations, while the incoming Biden Administration has committed to pursuing significant expansion of the Health Care Reform and is likely to reverse actions taken by the previous U.S. Administration to reduce enrollment and coverage requirements under Health Care Reform. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of Health Care Reform, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. In addition, portions of Health Care Reform were ruled unconstitutional by a federal appeals court in 2019. This ruling is under review by the United States Supreme Court, which is expected to rule on the validity of Health Care Reform during the Court term that ends in June 2021. It is unclear what, if any, additional legislative or regulatory actions may be taken in this regard. Accordingly, there may be an extended period of uncertainty and unpredictability in the U.S. health care market, which may materially affect the availability and cost of health coverage, the viability of health care providers and health benefit plans, the proportion of persons in the U.S. who have health insurance; the distribution between privately funded and government funded health insurance; and the future demand for, and profitability of, the offerings of our health-related business under our current business model.
    In connection with the processing of data, we frequently undertake or are subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, GLBA, and similar state and federal laws governing the collection, use, protection and disclosure of nonpublic personally identifiable information, including individually identifiable health information.
    HIPAA and its implementing regulations, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, subjects us to regulations and contractual obligations that impose privacy and security standards and breach notification and reporting requirements. An amendment to the HITECH Act enacted in January 2021 will require consideration of a company’s implementation of recognized security standards in assessing administrative fines and penalties under the HIPAA security standards. 
    In addition to tax, federal data privacy, security laws and regulations, we are subject to state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, governing confidentiality and security of personally identifiable information and additional state-imposed breach notification and reporting requirements. 
Anti-Bribery Regulations
The FCPA prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign government officials and political figures and includes anti-bribery provisions enforced by the Department of Justice and accounting provisions enforced by the SEC. The statute has a broad reach, covering all U.S. companies and citizens doing business abroad, among others, and defining a foreign official to include not only those holding public office but also local citizens affiliated with foreign government-run or -owned organizations. The statute also requires maintenance of appropriate books and records and maintenance of adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations.
Regulation - Foreign Jurisdictions
Australia
    The Company’s Australian operations are subject to laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of Australia governing banking and payment systems, financial services, credit products and money laundering. Because none of WEX Australia, WEX Fuel Cards Australia or WEX Prepaid Cards Australia holds an Australian Financial Services License or credit license or is an authorized deposit-taking institution, they operate within a framework of regulatory relief and exemptions afforded them on the basis that they satisfy the requisite conditions. The Company’s Australian operations are also subject to the Privacy Act (1988) and the Australian Privacy Principles.
Asia, including Singapore
    The Company’s operations in Asia are subject to the operation of the laws and regulation of the countries in which we operate, including laws with regards to banking and payment systems, financial services, money laundering and data protection.
Europe and the United Kingdom
    The Company’s European and United Kingdom operations are subject to laws and regulations of the European Union and United Kingdom and the countries in which we operate including, among others, those governing payment services, data protection, including General Data Protection Regulation (commonly referred to as “GDPR”), anti-money laundering and 
counter terrorist regulations, including the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Regulations 2019 in the UK and the Act on Financial Supervision in the Netherlands, and information security, and consumer credit.
