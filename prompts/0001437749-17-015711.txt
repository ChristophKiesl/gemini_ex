ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
Bio-Techne and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Bio-Techne (Bio-Techne, we, our, us or the Company) develop, manufacture and sell biotechnology reagents and instruments for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide. With our deep product portfolio and application expertise, we strive to provide the life sciences community with innovative, high-quality scientific tools to better understand biological processes and drive discovery.
 
We currently operate with three reporting segments – our Biotechnology, Protein Platforms and Diagnostics Divisions. Our Biotechnology Division is a leader in providing high quality proteins and antibodies, and related immunoassays, as well as biologically active small molecules and other reagents for the research and clinical diagnostics markets, all under the primary brands of R&D Systems, Novus Biologicals and Tocris Bioscience. Through our most recent acquisition, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, we also sell products for RNA in situ hybridization. Our Protein Platforms Division focuses on developing and supplying instrumentation and related consumables designed to simplify protein analysis processes along with single cell protein analysis, all under the ProteinSimple brand. Through our Diagnostics Division, we serve the clinical markets with regulated products such as controls, calibrators, reagents and immunoassays intended for diagnostic uses.
 
We are a Minnesota corporation with our global headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We originally were founded over forty years ago, in 1976, as Research and Diagnostic Systems, Inc. We became a publicly traded company in 1985 through a merger with Techne Corporation, now Bio-Techne Corporation. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “TECH.” We operate globally, with offices in multiple locations in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Today, our product line extends to over 300,000 manufactured products in state of the art facilities to accommodate many of our manufacturing needs.
 
Our historical focus was on providing high quality proteins, antibodies and immunoassays to the life science research market and hematology controls for the diagnostics market. Beginning in 2012, and accelerating over the last three years, we implemented a strategy to accelerate growth in part by acquiring businesses and product portfolios that leveraged and diversified our existing product lines, filled portfolio gaps with differentiated high growth businesses, and expanded our geographic scope.

OUR PRODUCTS AND MARKETS
 
In fiscal 2017, net sales from Bio-Techne’s Biotechnology, Protein Platforms and Diagnostics segments represented 65%, 16%, and 19% of consolidated net sales, respectively. Financial information relating to Bio-Techne’s segments is incorporated herein by reference to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Biotechnology Segment
 
Biotechnology Segment Products
 
Through our Biotechnology segment, we are one of the world's leading suppliers of specialized proteins, such as cytokines and growth factors, immunoassays, antibodies and related reagents, to the biotechnology research community. Our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides high quality tools which customers can use in solving the complexity of important biological pathways and glean knowledge that may lead to a more complete understanding of biological processes, and ultimately to the development of novel strategies to address different pathologies. 
 
The portfolio in this segment includes five main product lines: native and recombinant proteins, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, immunoassays, biologically active chemical compounds and, through our most recent acquisition, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, in situ genomic hybridization. As mentioned above, all are useful in a wide variety of important biomedical research activities. In addition, a number of our products have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of human diseases and conditions including cancer, autoimmunity, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, inflammation, neurological disorders, and kidney failure. Immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics. In fact, we have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing clearance for a few of our immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices. In addition to being useful research tools, our RNA in situ hybridization assays have diagnostics applications as well, and several are currently being cleared with the FDA in partnership with diagnostics instrument manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies.

Biotechnology Segment Customers and Distribution Methods
 
We sell our Biotechnology products directly to customers who are primarily located in North America, western Europe and China. We have a sales and marketing partnership agreement with Fisher Scientific in order to bolster our market presence in North America and leverage the transactional efficiencies offered by the large Fisher organization. We also sell through third party distributors in China, Japan, eastern Europe and the rest of the world. Our sales are widely distributed, and no single end-user customer accounted for more than 10% of Biotechnology's net sales during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
Biotechnology Segment Competitors
 
A number of companies supply the worldwide market for protein-related and chemically-based research and diagnostic reagents, including GE Healthcare Life Sciences, BD Biosciences, Merck KGaA/EMD Chemicals, Inc., PeproTech, Inc., Abcam plc., and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. Market success is primarily dependent upon product quality, selection, price and reputation. We believe we are one of the leading world-wide suppliers of cytokine related products in the research market. We further believe that the expansion of our product offering, their recognized quality, and the continued demand for protein-related and chemically-based research reagents will allow us to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic markets. 
Biotechnology Manufacturing
 
We are not dependent on key or sole source suppliers for most of our products in the Biotechnology segment. We develop and manufacture the majority of our proteins using recombinant DNA technology, thus significantly reducing our reliance on outside resources. Our antibodies are produced using a variety of technologies including traditional animal immunization and hybridoma technology as well as recombinant antibody techniques. Our chemical-based small molecule products are synthesized from widely available products. We typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products. 
 
The majority of our Biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers' orders. Consequently, we had no significant backlog of orders for our Biotechnology segment products as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2016.
 
Protein Platforms Segment
 
Proteins are important for understanding disease because they are the functional units that carry out specific tasks in every cell. Altered levels of certain proteins can prevent the cell from performing its intended function, produce the energy it requires, maintain its morphology or survive within the tissue. However, protein analysis is complex given the varied and unique three-dimensional structure of the many proteins of interest. Our Protein Platforms segment develops, manufactures and sells tools to simplify protein analysis while at the same time achieving more quantitative and reproducible results.
Protein Platforms Segment Products
 
Biologics Platform. Biologics are complex protein-based therapeutics, and are transforming the pharmaceutical industry and treatment of many diseases. Biologic drugs are very effective targeted therapeutics for diseases such as arthritis, cancer and diabetes, and their number in development is increasing because of a variety of advances in biochemistry, immunology and biotechnology. Developers of biologics are required by regulatory agencies, such as FDA, to develop robust processes to ensure that the specific biologic of interest can be identified and characterized accurately and then consistently and reliably produced. Our Biologics tools help researchers interrogate protein purity and identify contaminants during the development and production of biologics. Our Maurice, iCE3 and MFI platforms all measure some elements of protein identity, purity and heterogeneity.

The Simple Western Platform. The Western blot, or Western, is one of the most widely-used assays for protein analysis and identification today. Unchanged since its invention in 1979, the Western assay is used by molecular biologists, biochemists and clinicians to determine if a specific protein is present in a sample. Our Simple Western platform is a fully-automated Western blot analytical technique that can identify and quantify a protein of interest in a more sensitive, automated and less time intensive manner. 
 
SimplePlex Platform. A common assay used in research and clinical diagnostics is the ELISA, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The SimplePlex platform is a transformative immunoassay technology which integrates an innovatively designed microfluidic cartridge with a state-of-the-art analyzer to deliver a bench-top immunoassay system that is more sensitive than ELISA with none of the traditional challenges of assay design or repeatability. SimplePlex assays are fully automated, multi-analyte immunoassays that permit the customer to run multiple samples while interrogating multiple analytes in approximately one hour while leveraging the large biological content menu that has been developed over 30 years. We believe the SimplePlex technology, along with other immunoassay platforms offered by Bio-Techne, represents the most comprehensive line of immunoassay products to meet customers' complete workflow in their research and clinical protein applications.
 
Single Cell Western Platform. The Milo platform and related reagents perform western blot assays on individual cells versus an entire cell population. With this tool, customers can elucidate the properties of individual cells to better understand cell behavior that can shape the overall cell population response in a disease or normal state.
 
Protein Platforms Segment Customers and Distribution Methods
 
Our customers for this segment include researchers in academia as well as commercial researchers. Our biologics line of products is used primarily by production and quality control departments at biotech and pharmaceutical companies. We sell our Protein Platforms products directly to customers who are primarily located in North America, western Europe and Japan. We also sell through third party distributors in China, southern Europe and the rest of the world. Our sales are widely distributed, and no single end-user customer accounted for more than 10% of Protein Platforms' net sales during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
Protein Platforms Segment Competitors
 
Our Simple Western platform is a complete replacement for the traditional Western blot. As a result, we face competition from the vendors that supply instruments and reagents to traditional Western blot users. These competitors include Bio-Rad Laboratories, GE Healthcare, Merck KGaA, PerkinElmer and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Similarly, our SimplePlex platform replaces the traditional ELISA assay as well as some flow-based multiplex assays; competitors include those who supply instruments and reagents for ELISAs, including Meso Scale Discovery, PerkinElmer, Thermo Fisher, Luminex, Millipore, Quanterix, and Bio-Rad Laboratories. The primary competitors for our Biologics instrumentation are Agilent Technologies, Danaher and PerkinElmer, as well as GE Healthcare, Shimadzu, Thermo Fisher and Waters. We believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of our products and our product quality.
Protein Platforms Segment Manufacturing
 
We manufacture our products for this division at various locations in the United States and Canada. We manufacture our own components where we believe it adds significant value, but we rely on suppliers for the manufacture of some of the consumables, components, subassemblies and autosamplers used with, or included in, our systems, which are manufactured to our specifications. We are not dependent on any one supplier and are not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to assure ourselves of a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers. We conduct all final testing and inspection of our products. We have established a quality control program, including a set of standard manufacturing and documentation procedures.
 
There was no significant backlog of orders for our Protein Platforms products as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2016.

Diagnostics Segment (formerly Clinical Controls)
 
Diagnostics Segment Products
 
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Clinical Controls segment has been renamed Diagnostics. Our original business in this segment was focused primarily on controls and calibrators for hematology clinical instruments. With the acquisition of Bionostics in fiscal 2014 and Cliniqa in fiscal 2016, we expanded this segment to include blood chemistry and blood gas quality controls, diagnostic immunoassays, and other bulk and custom reagents for the in vitro diagnostic market. We renamed the operating segment to reflect this expanded portfolio of products.
 
Our hematology controls and calibrators ensure that hematology instruments are performing accurately and reliably. We believe our products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than most of those of our competitors. We also offer controls for blood glucose and blood gas devices, as well as coagulation device control products.
 
We also develop and supply bulk purified proteins, enzymes, disease-state plasmas, infectious disease antigens and processed serums to the clinical diagnostic industry worldwide. Often we manufacture these reagents on a custom basis to optimize their use in a customer's diagnostic assay. We supply these reagents in various formats including liquid, lyophilized and powder form. In fiscal 2017, we launched the Paratest® product, a novel and convenient stool collection and test device for the veterinary market, utilizing our expertise in packaging and reagents from our Devens, Massachusetts site. 
 
Diagnostics Segment Customers and Distribution Methods
 
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) agreements represent the largest market for our diagnostics products. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, OEM agreements accounted for $60.7 million, $54.2 million, and $41.1 million, or 57%, 52%, and 53% of division net sales in each fiscal year, respectively. We sell some of our diagnostics products directly to customers and, in Europe and Asia, also through distributors. One OEM customer accounted for approximately 12% and 13% of the Diagnostics Division's net sales during fiscal 2017 and 2015, respectively. This customer did not amount to 10% or more of the Company's consolidated revenue during these years. No customers accounted for more than 10% of the Diagnostics Division’s net sales during fiscal year 2016.
Diagnostics Segment Competitors
 
We believe we are the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind Beckman Coulter, Inc. and Streck, Inc. For our other control and calibrator products, the principal competitors are Abbott Diagnostics, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. and Sysmex Corporation. We compete based primarily on product performance, quality, and price. SeraCare, HyTest Ltd and Thermo Fisher Scientific are additional competitors in the clinical diagnostic manufacturing and reagents markets.
Diagnostics Segment Manufacturing
 
The primary raw material for our hematology controls products is whole blood. We purchase human blood from commercial blood banks, and porcine and bovine blood from nearby meat processing plants. Although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens prior to use, the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on our business thus far. Other controls are derived from various bodily fluids or cells from difference animal species, which are then processed in-house to isolate the product of interest or from other bulk reagent suppliers that specialize in certain products. Our other reagent products are manufactured using a variety of suppliers, with no supplier representing a material portion of our business. 
 
Most of the hematology controls products are shipped based on a preset, recurring schedule. However, the majority of our business in this segment are large orders shipped based on our customers' needs; we are highly dependent on our customers’ demand and inventory controls. Consequently, our revenues can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. There was no significant backlog of orders for our Diagnostics products as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2016.

PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT
 
Bio-Techne is engaged in continuous ongoing research and development in all of our major product lines. We believe that our future success depends, to a large extent, on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and market needs.
 
In fiscal 2017, aside from the large number of products added through the acquisition of Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Bio-Techne introduced approximately 1,500 new products. We also expect to significantly expand our portfolio of products through acquisitions as well as continued product development in our existing businesses. However, there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or, if completed, can be successfully introduced into the marketplace.

Percent of net sales | | 10 | % | | | 9 | % | | 9 | %

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections. 
 

 
6



With respect to our Protein Platforms segment and the Biotechnology segment’s genomic in situ hybridization product line, the protection is primarily through pending patent applications and issued patents. As of June 30, 2017, we had rights to 115 granted patents and approximately 100 pending patent applications. Patent protection, if granted, generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant. We cannot assure you whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent, whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and whether our claims will provide adequate coverage of our competitors' products or services. 
 
In addition to pursuing patents on our products, we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets, particularly in the Biotechnology segment. We have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate.
 
No assurance can be given that Bio-Techne's products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others, particularly for genetically engineered products. Bio-Techne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products. Where we have been contacted by patent holders with certain intellectual property rights, Bio-Techne has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive and/or non-exclusive right to sometimes use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented products to the research market. In addition, certain of our products are covered by licenses from third parties to supplement our own patent portfolio.
 
Bio-Techne has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its brand and product names. Bio-Techne believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered.
 
SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS
 
Bio-Techne believes there is some seasonality as a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base, particularly for the Biotechnology and Protein Platforms Segments. A majority of Diagnostics segment products are manufactured in large bulk lots and sold on a schedule set by the customer. Consequently, sales for that segment can be unpredictable, although not necessarily based on seasonality. As a result, we can experience material and sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in our revenue for this segment. 
EMPLOYEES
 
Through its subsidiaries, Bio-Techne employed approximately 1,800 full-time and part-time employees as of June 30, 2017.
 
INVESTOR INFORMATION
 
We are subject to the information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Such reports, proxy statements, and other information may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549 or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
