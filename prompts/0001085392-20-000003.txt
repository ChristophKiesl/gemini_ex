ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
Puget Energy is an energy services holding company incorporated in the state of Washington in 1999.  Substantially, all of its operations are conducted through its regulated subsidiary, Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE), a utility company.  Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned, non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG), which was formed in 2016 and has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility at the Port of Tacoma, Washington.
Puget Energy is owned through a holding company structure by Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings).   All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings). Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI), the Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), Ontario Municipal Employee Retirement System (OMERS) and PGGM Vermogensbeheer B.V. The sale of previous owners', Macquarie Infrastructure Partners and Macquarie Capital Group Limited, shares to OMERS, PGGM Vermogensbeheer B.V., AIMCo and BCI was approved by various federal and state agencies, including that of the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission), and closed on April 17th, 2019. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as “the Company.”
Corporate Strategy
Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.  Puget Energy’s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
Customers and Revenue Overview
PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960.  PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region.

PSE's revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year, primarily due to seasonal weather patterns, varying wholesale prices for electricity and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE, which make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult. Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage and affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses. While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and also month to month within a season, primarily as result of weather conditions. PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and corresponding higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales and corresponding lower power costs in the third quarter of the year. While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms for electric and natural gas operations are expected to normalize the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. Under the decoupling mechanism, the Washington Commission allows PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers. For additional information, see Business, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 1 of this report and Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.

Corporate Location
PSE’s and Puget Energy's principal executive offices are located at 355 110th Ave NE, Bellevue, Washington 98004 and the telephone number is (425) 454-6363.
Available Information
The Company’s reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available or may be accessed free of charge at the Company’s website, www.pugetenergy.com. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC and information may also be obtained via the SEC Internet website at www.sec.gov.
Regulation and Rates
PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (i) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (ii) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.  PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, whose standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) in PSE’s operating territory.
Rate mechanisms include: (i) trackers that typically track specific costs during the previous twelve-month period and (ii) riders that project cost recovery during a forward-looking twelve-month period. Both allow recovery of expenditures outside the process of a full general rate case (GRC).
The following table shows PSE’s rate filings for its trackers and riders and whether or not they are included in decoupling rates:

Rate Filings | Electric | Natural Gas
Baseline rates | Yes | Yes 
Expedited rate filing rider | Yes | Yes 
Power cost only rates mechanism | No | N/A

General Rate Case Filing
PSE filed a GRC with the Washington Commission on June 20, 2019, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of 6.9% and 7.9%, respectively. PSE requested a return on equity of 9.8% with an overall rate of return of 7.62%. In addition to the traditional areas of focus (revenue requirements, cost allocation, rate design and cost of capital), the Company completed an attrition study and included a portion of the attrition revenue requirement in the overall request in order to address the expected regulatory lag in the rate year. Additionally, as the non-plant related excess deferred taxes that resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) remained outstanding from PSE’s Expedited Rate Filing (ERF) as discussed below, PSE requested in its GRC to pass back the amounts over four years. On September 17, 2019, PSE filed a supplemental filing in the GRC, which provided updates as discussed in our original filing, but did not impact the requested overall electric and natural gas rate increases, return on equity or overall rate of return as originally filed. On January 15, 2020, PSE filed rebuttal testimony which included a reduction to the requested return on equity to 9.5%, which decreased the rate of return to 7.48%. The requested rate increase for both electric and natural gas remained at 6.9% and 7.9%, respectively. For both electric and 
natural gas PSE did not originally request its full attrition adjustment; therefore, the decrease in return on equity led to a reduction in the electric rate increase of only $1.5 million and did not have an impact on the natural gas rate increase. 
For further details regarding the 2019 GRC filing, see Note 4, "Regulations and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
Expedited Rate Filing
On November 7, 2018, PSE filed an ERF with the Washington Commission. On January 22, 2019, all parties in the proceeding reached an agreement on settlement terms. The settlement agreement was filed on January 30, 2019. On February 21, 2019, the Washington Commission approved the settlement with one condition: PSE must pass back the deferred balance associated with the tax over-collection of $34.6 million from January 1, 2018, through April 30, 2018, over a one-year period which began May 1, 2019. 
For further details regarding the 2018 ERF filing, see Note 4, "Regulations and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
Washington Commission Tax Deferral Filing
The TCJA was signed into law in December 2017. As a result of this change, PSE re-measured its deferred tax balances under the new corporate tax rate.  PSE filed an accounting petition on December 29, 2017, requesting deferred accounting treatment for the impacts of tax reform.  The deferred accounting treatment results in the tax rate change being captured in the deferred income tax balance with an offset to the regulatory liability for deferred income taxes.  Additionally, on March 30, 2018, PSE filed for a rate change for electric and natural gas customers associated with TCJA to reflect the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Other outcomes associated with PSE’s tax deferral filing are discussed in the ERF and GRC disclosures.
Decoupling Filings
While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms assist in mitigating the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. Since July 2013, the Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs and beginning December 19, 2017, fixed production costs from most residential, commercial and industrial customers. This monthly adjustment mitigates the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer. As a result, electric and natural gas delivery revenues are recovered on a per customer basis and electric fixed production energy costs are recovered on the basis of a fixed monthly amount regardless of actual consumption levels. The energy supply costs, which are part of the power cost adjustment (PCA) and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism. Total electric and natural gas revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption except for fixed production costs, which are held at the level of cost from the most recent rate proceeding and are not impacted by customer growth. Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period. For further details regarding decoupling filings, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Electric Rate Filings
Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism
PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the “power cost baseline” level of power costs. The “power cost baseline” levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.  Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. 
Effective January 1, 2017, the following graduated scale is used in the PCA mechanism:

 | Company's Share | | Customers’ Share | 
Annual Power Cost Variability | Over | Under | Over | Under
Over or Under Collected by up to $17 million | 100% | 100% | —% | —% 
Over or Under Collected by between $17 million - $40 million | 35 | 50 | 65 | 50 
Over or Under Collected beyond $40 + million | 10 | 10 | 90 | 90 

Power Cost Adjustment Clause Filing
The Power Cost Adjustment Clause filing reflects the transition fee as required by Section 12 of the Microsoft Special Contract.
Electric Conservation Rider
The electric conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year, as well as actual compared to the forecasted load set in rates. 
Electric Property Tax Tracker Mechanism
The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker is adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-up from the prior year. 
Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff
The Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff passes through to customers the benefits associated with the wind-related treasury grants. The filing results in a credit back to customers for pass-back of treasury grant amortization and pass-through of interest and any related true-ups. The filing is adjusted annually for new federal benefits, actual versus forecast interest and to true-up for actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates. Rates change annually on January 1. Additionally, this tracker is impacted by the TCJA previously discussed. Accordingly, PSE filed for a one-time rate change to be effective May 1, 2018, to recognize the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. 
Residential Exchange Benefit
The residential exchange program passes through the residential exchange program benefits that PSE receives from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA).  Rates change biennially on October 1.
Power Cost Only Rate Case
A power cost rate case (PCORC) is a limited-scope proceeding to reset power cost rates.  In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.  To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission is not required to but historically has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a GRC.
Natural Gas Rate Filings
Natural Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism
The purpose of the cost recovery mechanism (CRM) is to recover capital costs related to projects included in PSE's pipe replacement program plan on file with the Washington Commission with the intended effect of enhancing the safety of the natural gas distribution system. Rates change annually on November 1.
Purchased Gas Adjustment
PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest. PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances. A receivable or payable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an under recovery or over recovery, respectively, of natural gas cost through the PGA mechanism. Rates typically change annually on November 1, although out-of-cycle rate changes are allowed at other times of the year if needed.
Natural Gas Property Tax Tracker Mechanism
The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker is adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and adjustments to the rate from the prior year.
Natural Gas Conservation Rider
The natural gas conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year, as well as actual compared to the forecasted load set in rates.

Electric Supply
At December 31, 2019, PSE’s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 4,733 megawatts (MW).  PSE’s historical peak load of approximately 4,912 MW occurred on December 10, 2009.  In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments. When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy when sufficient transmission capacity is available.
The following table shows PSE’s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018:

Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts
During 2019, approximately 10.2% of PSE’s energy supply was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River (Mid-Columbia).   PSE’s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
As of December 31, 2019, PSE's portion of the power output of the PUDs’ projects are set forth below:

 | | | Company’s Annual Share (Approximate) | | 
Project | Contract Expiration Year | License Expiration Year | Percent of Output | | MW Capacity
Chelan County PUD: | | | | | 
Rock Island Project | 2031 | 2029 | 25.0 | % | | 156

Wanapum Development | 2052 | 2052 | 0.6 | | | 
Total | | | | | 722 

Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements
PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.  PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.  PSE also has an agreement with Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) for 300 MW of seasonal capacity exchange which currently has no set expiration. PG&E filed for bankruptcy on January 29, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, there was no outstanding obligation due from PG&E related to the energy exchange contract, an agreement in place to supplement peak loads through the transmission of energy from PG&E to PSE in the winter months and from PSE to PG&E in the summer months. During and since emerging from its 2001-2004 bankruptcy proceedings, PG&E delivered on the energy exchange contract and has continued to meet the exchange contract through its current bankruptcy proceedings.
PSE began participating in the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) operated by the California Independent System Operator on October 1, 2016. PSE has committed 450 MW of existing BPA transmission solely for the EIM market. Participation has resulted in reduced costs for PSE customers of approximately $16.2 million per annum, enhanced system reliability, integration of variable energy resources, and geographic diversity of electricity demand and generation resources. The calculated benefits represent the annual cost savings of the EIM dispatch compared with a counter-factual dispatch without the EIM. Benefits can take the form of cost savings or profits or their combination. Benefits include greenhouse gas (GHG) revenue, transfer revenues and flexible ramping revenues.
PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE’s system.  These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use. Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.  PSE’s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.  Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE’s load is available for sale to third parties.  PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
In 2019, PSE had 4,797 MW and 595 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.  PSE’s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.

Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers
PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet electrical demand through gas-fired generation. Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as turbine fueling varies depending on market heat rates.  Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.  PSE also enters into financial hedges to manage the cost of natural gas.  PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity and transportation that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE’s natural gas-fired generation resources.  
Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development
PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file an electric and natural gas integrated resource plan (IRP) every two years. However, the governor signed HB 5116, the Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA), into law on May 7, 2019. As a result, the 2019 IRP was suspended and a progress report was filed on November 15, 2019. Although the 2019 IRP process was suspended, a resource need was identified, but there was no final resource portfolio to identify cost effective conservation. Based on 2019 IRP resource need projections and conservation projections from the 2017 IRP, the capacity shortfalls and surpluses are:

 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023
Projected MW shortfall/(surplus) | 539 | 519 | 462 | 491 

PSE projects its future energy needs will exceed current resources in its supply portfolio beginning in 2020 because of the retirement of Colstrip Units 1 and 2. Colstrip 1 and 2 were retired effective December 31, 2019, and decreased capacity by approximately 307 MW per year. The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2017 IRP. As part of the CETA, PSE must achieve sales with renewable or non-emitting resources of at least 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2045. The 2021 IRP will fully explore the implementation of the CETA. PSE is currently pursuing resource acquisitions to meet the current capacity shortfall projections.

Natural Gas Supply for Natural Gas Customers
PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada (British Columbia and Alberta).  PSE also enters into physical and financial hedges to manage volatility in the cost of natural gas.  All of PSE’s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline, LLC (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE’s service territory.  Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE’s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
For base load, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in periods of lower demand, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during periods of high demand or reduced supply.  Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.  Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity. Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE’s natural gas system.  Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE’s LNG peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; as well as interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary.
PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.  PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and transportation capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
PSE’s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.  The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during periods of lower demand to minimize costs.  Natural gas is marketed outside of PSE’s service territory (off-system sales) to optimize resources when on-system customer demand requirements permit and market economics are favorable; the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE’s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
Natural Gas Storage Capacity
PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP’s pipeline to serve PSE’s natural gas customers.  The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE, and is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes due to its ability to deliver a large volume of natural gas in a short time period.  Combined with capacity contracted from NWP’s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE holds firm withdrawal capacity of 453,800 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, and over 9.8 million Dth of storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie facility. Of this total, PSE designates 397,100 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and over 9.2 million Dth of storage capacity to serve natural gas customers. The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE’s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.
Of the remaining Jackson Prairie storage capacity, 56,700 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 640,600 Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE's natural gas-fired generation resources. In addition, PSE has temporarily released approximately 6,100 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 178,500 of Dth of storage capacity to a third party, in exchange for temporary firm pipeline capacity on a constrained portion of NWP's system.
The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that provides operational flexibility and price protection. PSE holds 12.9 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,400 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of one and three years and has rights to extend such agreements.
LNG and Propane-Air Resources
LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.  Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
PSE holds a contract for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned natural gas at Plymouth, with a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth for use of the PSE generation fleet.  PSE uses the Plymouth contract as an alternate supply source for natural gas required to serve PSE’s generation fleet during peak periods on a daily or intra-day basis. In addition, 
PSE holds 15,000 Dth/day of firm pipeline capacity from Plymouth for the generation fleet. The balance of the LNG capacity is delivered using firm NWP pipeline transportation service previously acquired to serve PSE’s generation fleet.
PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.  This vaporized propane-air injection facility delivers the thermal equivalent of 10,000 Dth of natural gas per day for up to 12 days directly into PSE’s distribution system; however, it is temporarily out-of-service pending planned environmental and reliability upgrades.  PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering the equivalent of 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day.
Tacoma LNG Facility
 Currently under construction at the Port of Tacoma, the Tacoma LNG facility is expected to be operational in 2021. In January 2018, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA) determined a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) was necessary in order to rule on the air quality permit for the facility. As a result of requiring a SEIS, PSCAA's timing and decision on the air quality permit delayed the Company's construction schedule. In December 2019, PSCAA issued the air quality permit for the facility, a decision which has been appealed to the Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board by each of the Puyallup Tribe of Indians and nonprofit law firm Earthjustice. When completed, the Tacoma LNG facility is designed to provide peak-shaving services to PSE’s natural gas customers, and provide LNG as fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market. Pursuant to the Washington Commission’s order, PSE will be allocated 43.0% of the capital and operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility, and Puget LNG will be allocated the remaining 57.0% of the capital and operating costs. The portion of the Tacoma LNG facility allocated to PSE will be subject to regulation by the Washington Commission.
Natural Gas Transportation Capacity
PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by Cascade Natural Gas Company (CNGC), NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Enbridge Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).  GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TC Energy Corporation companies.  PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
PSE holds approximately 542,900 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE’s service territory.  In addition, PSE holds approximately 447,100 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored at Jackson Prairie to natural gas customers.  PSE holds approximately 217,900 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity on NWP to supply natural gas to its electric generating facilities.  In addition, PSE holds over 34,200 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie for its electric generating facilities. PSE’s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from one to 25 years.  However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts’ current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
PSE’s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast’s pipeline is 135,800 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of four to six years.  PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast’s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 88,400 Dth per day, with remaining terms of four to six years and an option for PSE to renew its rights under the Westcoast contract.  PSE has firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, each totaling approximately 79,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of four to six years and an option for PSE to renew its rights on the capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines.  PSE has other firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, which supplies the electric generating facilities, each totaling approximately 41,000 Dth per day, with remaining term of four years. PSE’s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on the GTN pipeline, totaling over 77,000 Dth per day, with remaining term of four years and PSE has a first right-of-refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules. PSE has other firm transportation capacity on GTN pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 40,600 Dth per day, with remaining terms of one to four years. PSE holds 259,000 decatherms per day of firm capacity on CNGC to connect generating facilities to the pipeline grid with remaining terms of one to two years.
Capacity Release
The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.  Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.  The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.  PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.  PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to 
unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release.  Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE’s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
Energy Efficiency
PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue all available electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.  PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices. PSE recovers the actual costs of its electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through rider mechanisms. However, the rider mechanisms do not provide assistance with gross margin erosion associated with reduced energy sales. To address this issue, PSE received approval in 2017 from the Washington Commission for continuation of electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms, which mitigates gross margin erosion resulting from the Company's energy efficiency efforts.
Environment
PSE’s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.  See below for the primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE’s operations and costs.
Air and Climate Change Protection
PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of Colstrip.  All of these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA), and all have CAA Title V operating permits, which must be renewed every five years.  This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants. PSE continues to monitor the permit renewal process to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants. These facilities also emit greenhouse gases (GHG), and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.  The Colstrip plant represents PSE’s most significant source of GHG emissions.
Species Protection
PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.  A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.  Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.  Designations of protected species under these laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
Remediation
PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites.  These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE (or its predecessors), as well as third-party owned properties where hazardous substances were allegedly generated, transported or released.  The primary cleanup laws to which PSE is subject include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and, in Washington, the Model Toxics Control Act (state).  PSE is also subject to applicable remediation laws in the state of Montana for its ownership interest in Colstrip. These laws may hold liable any current or past owner or operator of a contaminated site, as well as any generator, transporter, arranger, or disposer of regulated substances.
Hazardous and Solid Waste and PCB Handling and Disposal
Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes.  These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (federal), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal) and hazardous or dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
Water Protection
PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.  This includes most generation facilities (and all of those with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
Mercury Emissions
Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.  Compliance, based on a rolling twelve-month average, was first confirmed in January 2011, and PSE continues to meet the requirement.
 Further, Colstrip met the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) limits for mercury and acid gases as of April 2017.
Siting New Facilities
In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities in Washington, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, in addition to other possible local siting and zoning ordinances.  These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation
Recent and future environmental laws and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on the cost of PSE operations. PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets. Described below are the recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE’s operations and costs.
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
PSE takes seriously environmental stewardship, implementing both short-term measures and long-term strategies designed to manage greenhouse gas emissions in a scientifically sound and responsible fashion. The Company has worked closely with federal, state and local governments on deep decarbonization, and the reduction and mitigation of greenhouse gases. As a result, the Company intends and expects be net zero methane emissions by 2022, coal free by 2025 and its electric system will be carbon neutral by 2030. The Company is also helping Washington State address greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector by investing in electric vehicles, as well as the development of liquefied natural gas for maritime and commercial transportation. PSE also remains mindful of our customers' expectation of reliable, affordable service. The Company considers the cost of the decarbonization efforts to date, as well as future efforts in its IRP process, and will continue to engage in climate and greenhouse gas policy development. 
PSE's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting
PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the state of Washington Department of Ecology including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations. Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the environmental protection agency (EPA). Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time. Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE’s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.
The most recent data indicate that PSE’s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2017 were 10.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.  Approximately 43.7% of PSE’s total GHG emissions (approximately 4.5 million metric tons) are associated with PSE’s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip (with the closure of Units 1&2 effective December 31, 2019, PSE expects an approximately 45% reduction in Colstrip GHG emissions). PSE’s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers’ needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
Federal Greenhouse Gas Rules: New and Existing Power Plants
On October 23, 2015, the EPA published a final rule regarding New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for the control of carbon dioxide (CO2) from new power plants that burn fossil fuels under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act. New natural 
gas power plants can emit no more than 1,000 lbs. of CO2/megawatt hour (MWh) which is achievable with the latest combined cycle technology. New coal power plants can emit no more than 1,400 lbs. of CO2/MWh. Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) was reaffirmed by the EPA in this rule as the “best system of emission reductions” (BSER). 
On December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule that would revise the NSPS for greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired power plants. The Proposed Rule, would revise the emissions standards for new, modified, and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam generating units that are either utility boilers or integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) units based on the Agency’s proposed revised Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER). The EPA is not proposing any changes nor reopening the standards of performance for newly constructed or reconstructed stationary combustion turbines.. For large units, the BSER is proposed to be super-critical steam conditions, and if revised, the emission rate will be 1,900 pounds of CO2 per megawatt-hour on a gross output basis (lb. CO2/MWh-gross). For small units, the BSER is proposed to be subcritical steam conditions, and if revised, the emission rate will be 2,000 lbs. of CO2/MWh-gross. The EPA proposes to replace the CCS BSER determination with a BSER for newly constructed coal-fired units based on the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle in combination with the best operating practices. The primary reason for this proposed revision is the high costs and limited geographic availability of CCS. 
 In June 2014, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act designed to regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants. The proposed rule includes state-specific goals and guidelines for states to develop plans for meeting these goals. The EPA published a final rule in October 2015. In March 2017, then EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, signed a notice of withdrawal of the proposed CPP federal plan and model trading rules and, in October 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the CPP rule.
  In August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.. The ACE rule was finalized in June 2019, and establishes emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired plants. Compliance plans under ACE are due July 2020, and compliance generally required by July 2024. PSE is evaluating the final ACE rule to determine its impact on operations pending the outcome of the proposed Colstrip sale to NorthWestern Energy.
Washington Clean Air Rule
The CAR was adopted in September 2016, in Washington State and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from “covered entities” located within Washington State. Included under the new rule are large manufacturers, petroleum producers and natural gas utilities, including PSE. The CAR sets a cap on emissions associated with covered entities, which decreases over time approximately 5.0% every three years. Entities must reduce their carbon emissions, or purchase emission reduction units (ERUs), as defined under the rule, from others. 
In September 2016, PSE, along with Avista Corporation, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and NW Natural, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington challenging the CAR. In September 2016, the four companies filed a similar challenge to the CAR in Thurston County Superior Court. In March 2018, the Thurston County Superior Court invalidated the CAR. The Department of Ecology appealed the Superior Court decision in May 2018. As a result of the appeal, direct review to the Washington State Supreme Court was granted and oral argument was held on March 16, 2019. In January 2020, the Washington Supreme Court affirmed that CAR is not valid for “indirect emitters” meaning it does not apply to the sale of natural gas for use by customers. The court ruled, however, that the rule can be severed and is valid for direct emitters including electric utilities with permitted air emission sources, but remanded the case back to the Thurston County to determine which parts of the rule survive. Meanwhile, the federal court litigation has been held in abeyance pending resolution of the state case.
Washington Clean Energy Transition Act
In May 2019, Washington State passed the 100 Percent Clean Electric Bill that supports Washington's clean energy economy and transitioning to a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future. The Clean Energy Transition Act requires all electric utilities to eliminate coal-fired generation from their allocation of electricity by December 31, 2025; to be carbon-neutral by January 1, 2030, through a combination of non-emitting electric generation, renewable generation, and/or alternative compliance options; and makes it the state policy that, by 2045, 100% of electric generation and retail electricity sales will come from renewable or non-emitting resources. Clean Energy Implementation plans are required every four years from each investor-owned utility (IOU) and must propose interim targets for meeting the 2045 standard between 2030 and 2045, and lay out an actionable plan that they intend to pursue to meet the standard. The Washington Commission may approve, reject, or recommend alterations to an IOU’s plan.
In order to meet these requirements, the Act clarifies the Washington Commission’s authority to consider and implement performance and incentive- based regulation, multi-year rate plans, and other flexible regulatory mechanisms where appropriate. The Act mandates that the Washington Commission accelerate depreciation schedules for coal-fired resources, including transmission lines, to December 31, 2025, or to allow IOUs to recover costs in rates for earlier closure of those 
facilities. IOUs will be allowed to earn a rate of return on certain Power Purchase Agreements (PPA's) and 36 months deferred accounting treatment for clean energy projects (including PPAs) identified in the utility’s clean energy implementation plan.
IOUs are considered to be in compliance when the cost of meeting the standard or an interim target within the four-year period between plans equals a 2% increase in the weather adjusted sales revenue to customers from the previous year. If relying on the cost cap exemption, IOUs must demonstrate that they have maximized investments in renewable resources and non-emitting generation prior to using alternative compliance measures. 
The law requires additional rulemaking by several Washington agencies for its measures to be enacted and PSE is unable to predict outcomes at this time. The Company intends to seek recovery of any costs associated with the clean energy legislation through the regulatory process.
Regional Haze Rule
In January 2017, the EPA provided revisions to the Regional Haze Rule which were published in the Federal Register. Among other things, these revisions delayed new Regional Haze review from 2018 to 2021, however, the end date will remain 2028. In January 2018, the EPA announced that it would revisit certain aspects of these revisions and PSE is unable to predict the outcome. Challenges to the 2017 Regional Haze Revision Rule are pending in abeyance in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, pending resolution of EPA’s reconsideration of the rule.
Coal Combustion Residuals
In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 2015, which regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR's) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D. The CCR rule is self-implementing at a federal level or can be taken over by a state. The rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage. The rule also sets forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including posting specific information related to CCR surface impoundments and landfills to publicly-accessible websites.
The CCR rule requires significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015. PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip in 2003. Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO). In 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned certain provisions of the CCR rule in 2018 and remanded some of its provisions back to the EPA. As a result of that decision and certain other developments, EPA has is working on developing new rules regarding CCR, including a new proposed date of August 31, 2020, for facilities to stop placing coal ash into unlined surface impoundments. In addition, the EPA has stated that it will soon propose a federal permitting program for coal ash disposal units.
PCB Handling and Disposal
In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) containing equipment.  The EPA is using this Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
The rule was scheduled to be published in July 2015, but due to the number of comments received by the EPA, the rule has undergone multiple extensions and revisions. It was anticipated that the rule would be published in November 2017. However, in January 2017, the Trump Administration published the Executive Order on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs directive which placed the rulemaking on indefinite hold. At this point, PSE cannot determine what impacts this rulemaking will have on its operations, if any, but will continue to work closely with the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group and the American Gas Association (AGA) to monitor developments.
