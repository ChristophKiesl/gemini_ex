DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Overview

Inky is a company, incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 12, 2018. Inky (we, us, or the Company) develops, publishes and markets mobile software application for smartphones and tablet devices (Apps). Inky is engaged in mobile applications development. Inky facilitates the User deciding what and where to ink without having to actually commence the tattoo procedure. The User simply utilizes Inky to preview a proposed tattoo. Then the tattoo technician utilizes the User phones camera to position and overlay the proposed tattoo. Users will be able to download our Application through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Market.
 
We plan to generate revenue from sales, or downloads, of our App and from advertisements published on our ad supported app titles.
 
The member of our management has accumulated significant experience, knowledge and contacts across the key disciplines in the digital and mobile industries. This encompasses digital and social media sales, advertising, operations, and technology and product development and deployment. We expect to leverage managements industry experience and contacts to our advantage.
 
Industry Background and Trends

An App is a type of application software designed to run on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet device. Inky is an App that facilitates the user deciding what and where to ink without having to actually commence the tattoo procedure. 
 
Over the last several years, mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, have proliferated extensively around the world across a wide range of demographic groups, which is demonstrated in the following statistics published by the noted sources:

· As of August 2017, there are over 3.5 billion unique mobile internet users. Source: Statista
 · Users spend on average 69% of their media time on smartphones. Source: comScore
 · Mobile devices will drive 80% of global internet usage. Source: Zenith
 · 50% of the time individuals spend on digital media is on mobile apps. Source: comScore
 · The total number of Android app downloads in 2016 was 90 billion. Source: App Annie
 · Despite the sea of choice for mobile apps available for both iOS and Android, in real life people tend to use only a few on a daily basis. The average number of apps people use is 9 apps daily, and 30 apps monthly. Source: TechCrunch
 · Mobile websites get more visitors than native apps. But those people spend a lot less time on mobile websites than they do on apps. Source: comScore
 · There are about 8 million apps in the Google Play store, 2.2 million in the Apple App Store, 669K in the Windows Store, and 600K in the Amazon Appstore. Source: Statista

As mobile devices have become more prevalent, the mobile Apps industry has experienced corresponding growth in the number of Apps published and the niches they serve, as well as the revenues they generate. We believe that there will continue to be an increase in the number of smartphones and tablets sold. In addition, Apple, Samsung and other mobile device manufacturers have introduced new, larger and more powerful smartphones and tablets that enable more complex Apps and that allow app developers to create apps that are optimized for larger screen sizes and designed to take advantage of these devices advanced capabilities and functionality. We believe that the proliferation of and technological developments to mobile devices will continue to drive growth in our industry for the foreseeable future.
 
Our App 

Inky is engaged in mobile applications development area. 

The app includes a selection of designs by different tattoo artists that you can try out virtually via the automation of smartphone-powered augmented reality placing pixels on your flesh in real-time.

There are two profiles: User and Master in our application. If you want to share your sketches and your work with others, you need to sign up as Master. If you just want to try the tattoo via our application on your body you should sign up as User. You can change your account mode to the other without any problem, just sign out from the current mode and sign up as the other as needed. As Master, you can upload your own sketches to the app to see whether your pen skills are sharp enough to merit leaving a permanent mark on your person.

The app asks you to put a little ink on your skin  think of that as part of the try before you buy process  because you need to draw an inky sign in the form of an octopus on your person in the place where youre considering the real deal.
 
Then the Augmented Reality (AR) tech uses your phones camera, combined with your three ink marks, to position and overlay what might be your future tattoo. So youre peeking through your smartphone screen at an alternative tattooed you. Which is about as useful as AR gets right now.

Our app is designed to appeal to a variety of age groups ranging from younger teens to adults. We offer our app in both a free advertisement-supported version and a paid version that does include the tattoo base from Inky, as Inky Master. We believe that by offering free ad supported versions we can build a significantly larger customer base more quickly than we could if we charged users an up-front fee to download our apps since they may be reluctant to purchasing an app without first playing it. If the users enjoy a title, they may purchase the app and try Inky tattoo base. 

In the future, we intend to broaden the scope of our App to include piercing, scarring, tunnels, microdermabrasion, tattoos on the white of the eye, microdermabrasion (silicone implants). 

In the future, we also plan to develop our application in the application-profile for the Masters who will fill in information about themselves and users will choose the real tattoo Master according to the tattoo works and their geolocation.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We plan to market, sell and distribute our Inky Apps exclusively through Apples App Store and through the Google Play Store, the largest direct-to-consumer digital storefronts. We expect that a majority of our revenues will be derived from sales on the Apple App Store.

We plan to generate revenue from downloads of our paid App mode and from advertisements published on our ad supported app and game titles. We are planning to enter into agreements with each of Apple and Google that govern our relationship as developers / distributors on their respective storefronts. 

We will complete the process of migrating the Apps into our corporate structure. We recently retained a new ad network that we believe employs a more effective technology platform and a more aggressive direct sales team. We also are integrating into our existing app and will incorporate into our new apps lucrative ad models and in-app purchasing.
 
We may partner with other App publishers to develop and market new titles. These types of arrangements will allow us to defray development and marketing costs among a wider range of titles and increase our chances of publishing a successful title.
 
We will employ advanced analytics, a means of analyzing data we collect about users of our Apps, to develop and publish more appealing titles and features in our apps.
 
Our ability to market our Apps successfully on direct-to-consumer digital storefronts will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to build relationships with storefront owners and educate them about our title roadmap so that they feature or otherwise prominently place them within the storefront. If we are able to achieve these ends, we believe that consumers are more likely to find our Apps, which may result in greater downloads and more revenue. We believe that a number of factors may influence the featuring or placement of an App, including:

· the perceived attractiveness of the title;
 · the level of critical or commercial success of the App or of other Apps previously introduced by a publisher;
 · incorporation of the storefront owners latest technology in the publishers title;
 · how strong the consumer experience is on all of the devices that discover titles using any given digital storefront;
 · the publishers relationship with the applicable storefront owner and future pipeline of quality titles for it; and
 · the current market share of the publisher.
 
We also expect to undertake a number of marketing initiatives designed to attract consumers to download our Apps, including:

· using social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, focused directly at the target users of our Apps;
 · paying third parties to advertise or incentivize consumers to download our Apps through offers or recommendations;
 · using push notifications to alert existing and prospective users of updates to our Apps and new product offerings;
 · cross-promoting our Apps through banner advertisements in our other Apps, as well as advertising our Apps in our competitors product offerings; and

· undertaking outreach efforts with video app websites and related media outlets, such as providing reviewers with access to our apps prior to launch.
  
Competition
 
Developing and distributing Apps is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts. With respect to competing for consumers of our app, we will compete primarily on the basis of app quality, brand and customer reviews. We will compete for promotional and digital storefront placement based on these factors, as well as our relationship with the storefront owner, historical performance, perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands, properties and other content. 
 
We believe that our small size will provide us a competitive edge for the time being and allow us to make quick decisions as to product development to take advantage of consumer preferences at a particular point in time.
 
With respect to our App, we compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including industry leaders such as Activision, DeNA, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Apploft, GREE, GungHo Online Entertainment, King Digital Entertainment, Nexon, Warner Brothers and Zynga and many well-funded private companies, including Kabam, Machine Zone, Rovio, Storm 8/Team Lava and Supercell. We could also face increased competition if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook or Yahoo, choose to enter or expand in the apps space or develop competing apps. One of the main competitors is the InkHunter, whose prototype application is similar to ours. But we believe we are also a good competitor.
 
In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals in all of our segments who are able to create and launch Apps and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. 

Most of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, including:
 · significantly greater financial and personnel resources;
 · stronger brand and consumer recognition;
 · the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;
 · more substantial intellectual property of their own;
 · lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale; and
 · broader distribution and presence.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect our business, including those relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information and those relating to the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, advertising and marketing activities, and sweepstakes and contests. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services, may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
Employees
 
We are a start-up company and currently have one employee only - Ioanna Kallidou, our president, treasurer, secretary and director. We intend to outsource any additional services if the business requires.
