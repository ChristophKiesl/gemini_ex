Overview
Our primary mission is to advance diagnostics to improve human health. We have a leadership position in the development, manufacturing and marketing of rapid diagnostic testing solutions. We currently sell our products directly to end users and distributors, in each case, for professional use in physician offices, hospitals, clinical laboratories, reference laboratories, urgent care clinics, leading universities, retail clinics, pharmacies and wellness screening centers, as well as for individual, non-professional, over-the-counter (“OTC”) use. More recently, we have begun to reach significant new markets as we introduced our QuickVue® At-Home OTC COVID-19 test for reopening schools, and for health departments, employers, entertainment centers and many other locations. We market our products through a network of distributors and a direct sales force. We operate in one business segment that develops, manufactures and markets our products globally.
When we commenced our operations in 1979, we were originally incorporated as Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc. in the State of California. In 1987, we re-incorporated as Quidel Corporation in the State of Delaware. We launched our first products, dipstick-based pregnancy tests, in 1983. Since such time, our product base and technology platforms have expanded through internal research and development and acquisitions of other products, technologies and companies. Our diagnostic solutions aid in the detection and diagnosis of many critical diseases and other medical conditions, including infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases and conditions, women’s health, gastrointestinal diseases, autoimmune diseases, bone health and thyroid diseases. 
In 2017, we acquired the Triage® MeterPro® cardiovascular and toxicology business (“Triage Business”), and B-type Natriuretic Peptide (“BNP”) assay business run on Beckman analyzers (“BNP Business” and, together with the Triage Business, the “Triage and BNP Businesses”) from Alere Inc. (“Alere”), which added an extensive cardiovascular and toxicology menu to our innovative medical diagnostics portfolio. 
On December 22, 2021, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “BCA”) with Ortho, Coronado Topco, Inc. (“Topco”), Orca Holdco, Inc. (“US Holdco Sub”) and Laguna Merger Sub, Inc. (“US Merger Sub”), each a wholly owned subsidiary of Topco, and Orca Holdco 2, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of US Holdco Sub (“US Holdco Sub 2”). Under the terms of the BCA, we are entering into a business combination with Ortho under Topco, a new holding company (the “Combinations”). Ortho will be acquired for total consideration of approximately $4.3 billion (which is based on the February 9, 2022 closing price of our common stock of $97.64 per share), including $1.75 billion of cash, funded through cash on our balance sheet and expected incremental borrowings. The Combinations are subject to approval by both our stockholders and Ortho’s shareholders, as well as customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. It is anticipated that the Combinations will close in the first half of 2022. For additional information about the Combinations, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.

We also utilize specialized equipment for the lyophilization of reagents, cell culture growth, protein purification and a variety of automation for dispensing of antibodies, reagents and solutions. This facility is certified to ISO 13485:2016 and MDSAP medical device standards. Packaging, warehousing and shipping logistics with cold chain storage capability are handled at this facility.
Our Summers Ridge, San Diego, California facility consists of laboratories that are involved in mammalian cell culture, bacterial fermentation, protein purification and modification, as well as other techniques involved in immunoassay reagent manufacturing. These reagents are used in the manufacture of devices made at this facility and are also supplied to a third party as key active ingredients for BNP products that run on Beckman analyzers. In addition, this facility has production areas dedicated to creating and processing plastic components that are subsequently transformed into finished devices (cardiac and drugs of abuse products) using customized manufacturing equipment, including specialized automation. This facility is certified to the ISO 13485:2016 and MDSAP medical device standards. Most of the products are packaged and subsequently distributed by our San Diego distribution center.
Our facility in Europe conducts packaging, warehousing and shipping logistics with cold chain storage capability for Europe and the Middle East. 
We seek to conduct our manufacturing in compliance with QMS regulatory requirements of the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Europe, South Korea and certain other countries. Our manufacturing facilities have passed routine regulatory inspections confirming compliance with the QMS regulatory requirements. Our facilities are registered with various regulatory bodies, including the FDA and the Department of Public Health of the State of California for our San Diego and Carlsbad facilities.
Competition
Competition in the development and marketing of in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) products is intense, and innovation, product development, regulatory clearance to market and commercial introduction of new IVD technologies can occur rapidly. We believe that some of the most significant competitive factors in the rapid diagnostic market include convenience, speed to result, specimen flexibility, product menu, clinical needs, price, reimbursement levels and product performance, as well as effective distribution, advertising, promotion and brand recognition. The competitive factors in the central laboratory market are also significant and include price, product performance, reimbursement, compatibility with routine specimen procurement methods, and manufacturing products in testing formats that meet the workflow demands of larger volume laboratories. We believe our success will depend on our ability to remain abreast of technological advances, to develop, gain regulatory clearance and introduce technologically advanced products, to effectively market to customers a differentiated value proposition represented by our commercialized products, to maintain our brand strength and to attract and retain experienced personnel. The majority of diagnostic tests requested by physicians and other healthcare providers are performed by independent clinical reference laboratories. We expect that these laboratories will continue to compete vigorously to maintain their dominance of the testing market. In order to achieve market acceptance for our products, we will be required to continue to demonstrate that our products provide physicians and central laboratories cost-effective and time-saving alternatives to other competitive products and technologies.
Many of our current and prospective commercial competitors, including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies, have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. These competitors include, among others, Abbott Laboratories, Beckman Coulter Primary Care Diagnostics, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Becton Dickinson and Company, Meridian Bioscience, Inc., and Danaher Corporation. We also face competition from our distributors since some have created, and others may decide to create, their own products to compete with ours. Competition may also exist with large, medium and small development companies whose portfolio and technologies are dedicated to the development of diagnostic solutions in areas in which we currently have relevant market share. 
Seasonality
Sales of our respiratory products are subject to, and significantly affected by, the seasonal demands of the cold and flu seasons, prevalent during the fall and winter. As a result of these seasonal demands, we typically experience lower sales volume in the second and third quarters of the calendar year, and typically have higher sales in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. The COVID-19 pandemic and impact of sales of our COVID-19 products combined with a very mild flu season diminished the seasonal effects in 2020 and 2021. Historically, sales of our influenza products have varied from year to year based, in large part, on the severity, length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, sales of our influenza products accounted for 4%, 8% and 26%, respectively, of total revenue. In addition, it is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have similar seasonal demands and impacts on our revenues in the future. 
Government Regulations
US Regulations of Medical Devices
The testing, manufacture and commercialization of our products in the US are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state regulatory agencies. Pursuant to the US Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the FDA regulates the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of medical devices. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other matters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request a recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed in the US if the device is deemed to be unsafe.
In the US, devices are classified into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I and II devices are subject to general controls, including, but not limited to, performance standards, 510(k) clearance process and post-market surveillance. Class III devices generally pose the highest risk to the patient and are typically subject to premarket approval to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Our current products are all Class I or II. 
The FDA can authorize the emergency use of an unapproved medical product or an unapproved use of an approved medical product, referred to as emergency use authorization or EUA, for certain emergency circumstances after the Health and Human Services Secretary has made a declaration of emergency justifying authorization of emergency use. An EUA allows use in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by emerging infectious disease threats when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The FDA may also waive otherwise-applicable current good manufacturing practice (“CGMP”) requirements to accommodate emergency response needs. All of our current products for testing for the COVID-19 virus are sold under EUA.
Prior to commercialization in the US market, manufacturers of diagnostic assays like our products are typically required to obtain FDA clearance through a premarket notification or premarket approval process, which can be lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The FDA has been requiring more rigorous demonstration of product performance as part of the 510(k) process, including submission of extensive clinical data. It generally takes from three months to one year to obtain clearance, but may take longer. A premarket approval application must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, typically including the results of clinical investigations, bench tests and reference laboratory studies. In addition, modifications or enhancements for existing products that could significantly affect their safety or effectiveness or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, will require new submissions to the FDA.
The FDA’s CLIA regulate laboratory testing and requires clinical laboratories to be certified by their state, as well as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), before diagnostic testing can be conducted. Laboratories using our assays must obtain a CLIA certificate. Waived testing is designated by CLIA as simple testing that carries a low risk for an incorrect result. The CLIA-waived designation is critical for most of our products that are intended for POC settings. The FDA’s current guidance entitled “Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 CLIA Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices” sets forth requirements for obtaining a CLIA waiver, which are onerous and have increased the time and cost we are required to spend to obtain a CLIA waiver.
Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA clearance or approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including adherence to Quidel System Regulations relating to testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. We must also comply with Medical Device Reporting requirements, which mandates reporting to the FDA of any incident in which a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which a device malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Current FDA enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses.
Regulations Outside of the US
For marketing outside the US, we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the US, and may require us to perform additional or different preclinical or clinical testing regardless of whether we have obtained FDA clearance or approval. The amount of time required to obtain necessary approvals varies from that required for FDA clearance or approval. In many foreign countries, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required.
Our initial focus for obtaining marketing approval outside the US is typically in the European Union (“EU”), Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and Japan. EU regulations and directives generally classify healthcare products either as medicinal products, medical devices or IVD. The CE Mark certification for the EU requires us to receive certification from ISO for the manufacture of our products. This certification comes only after the development of an all-inclusive quality system, which is reviewed for compliance with ISO standards by a notified body accredited by an EU member state. After certification is received, a technical file is developed that attests to the product’s compliance to Regulation Directive 98/79/EC for IVD medical devices. Only after this point is the product CE Marked. In addition, the EU has recently adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the "EU MDR") and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the "EU IVDR"), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices than in the US, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. The compliance deadline for the EU MDR was May 2021. Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR, unless an extension has been granted. Complying with these regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these regulatory requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. 
Chinese regulations require registration of diagnostic products with China’s National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”, formerly CFDA). Additional clinical trials in China are typically required for registration purposes. ISO certification is included in applications for registration to NMPA. Japanese regulations require registration of IVD products with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. For products marketed in Canada, registration is required with Health Canada. For products marketed in Australia, registration is required with the Therapeutic Goods Administration. IVD products in Brazil are regulated by the Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria. For our products marketed in Canada, Japan, Brazil, Australia and the US, the MDSAP is a single regulatory audit of our QMS that satisfies the requirements of all five of these jurisdictions. Additionally, with Brexit in place, we are obtaining any necessary approvals directly from the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.
Other Healthcare Laws
Our products are subject to various healthcare-related laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing, sales and marketing practices, and the privacy and security of health information, including, among others: (i) US federal regulations regarding quality and cost by the US Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), including CMS, as well as comparable state and non-US agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud; (ii) the US federal Anti-Kickback Statute; (iii) the federal Physician Self‐Referral Law; (iv) the False Claims Act (“FCA”); (v) the Physician Payments Sunshine Act; and (vi) numerous state laws regulating healthcare and insurance. Among other things, these laws and others generally (a) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients or for the purchase, order, or recommendation of any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, including Medicare and Medicaid; (b) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; and (C) require the maintenance of certain government licenses and permits.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions, as well as customer-imposed controls, as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. US federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain health-related and other personal information, in particular personally identifiable information such as medical records, and restrict the collection, use and disclosure of that protected information. At the federal level, the HHS promulgates health information privacy and security rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which protect health information by regulating its use and disclosure. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose personally identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. In addition to HIPAA, individual states also regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. For example, a broad privacy law in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), came into effect in January 2020. The CCPA has some of the same features as the GDPR (discussed below) such as certain requirements for data collection, use and sharing practices and certain rights of consumers concerning the use, disclosure, and retention of their personal data. The CCPA has already prompted several other states to follow with similar laws. The EU General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018 (“GDPR”) has imposed significantly stricter requirements in how we collect, transmit, process and retain personal data, including, among other things, in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities and prompt notice to data subjects with significant fines for non-compliance. Several other countries such as China and Russia have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions.
Environmental, Health and Safety Laws
We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the US, such as those related to safe working conditions and laboratory practices. Like other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and research activities involve the purchase, storage, movement, use and disposal of substances regulated under environmental, health and safety laws, including those related to hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.
Other Laws and Regulations Governing Our Sales, Marketing and Shipping Activities
We are subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the UK Bribery Act and various other similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Among other things, these laws generally prohibit us and our intermediaries from offering, promising or making payments to foreign government entities or officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to pertinent US and foreign laws relating to the import and export of finished goods, raw materials and supplies. We also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws, which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties. Additionally, we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
Intellectual Property
The healthcare industry has traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret and trademark protection for commercially relevant technologies, devices, products and processes. We possess numerous patents, trade secrets and trademarks, and in the aggregate, our intellectual property is of material importance in the operation of our business. We, however, believe that no single patent, trade secret or trademark is material in relation to our business as a whole.
We actively pursue patents for technologies that are considered novel and patentable. However, important factors, many of which are not within our control, can affect whether and to what extent patent protection in the US and in other important markets worldwide is obtained. For example, the speed, accuracy and consistency in application of the law in a patent office within any particular jurisdiction are beyond our control and can be unpredictable. The resolution of issues such as these and their effect on our long-term success are also indeterminable. We have issued patents, both in the US and internationally, and have patent applications pending throughout the world.
It has been our policy to file for patent protection in the US and other countries with significant markets, such as Western European countries and Japan, if the economics are deemed to justify such filing and our patent counsel advises that relevant patent protection may be obtained.
A large number of individuals and commercial enterprises seek patent protection for technologies, products and processes in fields in, or related to, our areas of product development. To the extent such efforts are successful, we may be required to obtain licenses and pay significant royalties in order to exploit certain of our product strategies. Licenses may not be available to us at all or, if so available, may not be available on acceptable terms.
We are aware of certain patents issued to various developers of diagnostic products with potential applicability to our diagnostic technology. We have licensed rights from companies to assist with the manufacturing of certain products. In the future, we expect that we will require or desire additional licenses from other parties in order to refine our products further and to allow us to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable or superior products effectively.
We seek to protect our trade secrets and technology by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties (such as potential licensees, customers, strategic partners and consultants). In addition, we have implemented certain security measures in our laboratories and offices. Also, to the extent that consultants or contracting parties apply technical or scientific information independently developed by them to our projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such data.
We have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the US and in foreign countries that are used in our business and in conjunction with the sale of our products. Our principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed above in the section entitled “Products.”
Under many of our contractual agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the counterparty against costs and liabilities arising out of any patent infringement claims and other intellectual property claims asserted by a third party relating to products sold under those agreements.
Human Capital and ESG Strategies
Human Capital Resources 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,600 employees worldwide, with approximately 1,400 employees in the US and approximately 200 employees outside of the US, none of whom are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.
Workforce Health and Safety 
We maintain health and safety programs conforming to best practices in the diagnostics industry. We are focused on minimizing risk and protecting our employees and communities by employing safe technologies and operating procedures, and in turn minimizing recordable incidents and improving safety across our organization.
Diversity and Inclusion 
Our employees are one of our most important assets and set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives, drive operational execution, deliver strong financial performance, advance innovation, and maintain our quality and compliance programs. The success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. We strive to provide a positive work environment for all employees, consultants, contingent workers, vendors, and customers. One of the ways we accomplish this is by embracing a variety of diverse experiences and perspectives and being inclusive team players. We are dedicated to providing employees with a great place to work where they can offer their diverse talents, experiences and perspectives to innovate and create diagnostic solutions.
We are committed to maintaining an environment of equal employment opportunities for all job applicants and members of our team. We fulfill this commitment through a variety of measures, including internal and external posting of job openings, hiring, training and promoting employees without regard to race, color, religion, gender identity or expression, pregnancy, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, military or veteran status, disability, medical condition, marital or domestic partner status, sexual orientation, age, or any other considerations made unlawful by federal, state or local law. We prohibit discrimination based on a perception that anyone has any of these characteristics or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of these characteristics. In addition, we look at company programs, policies, procedures and activities with diversity and inclusion in mind. In keeping with our core values, we are steadfast in taking action to ensure equal employment opportunity in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws.
As of December 31, 2021, 48% of our US employees identified as female and 53% of our US employees identified as having a racial and ethnic background other than white. As of December 31, 2021, our executive management team consisted of nine members, of whom 33% identified as female. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) consisted of 10 members, of whom 30% identified as female and 20% identified as having a racial and ethnic background other than white.
Corporate Philanthropy 
We listen to our internal and external stakeholders and translate their needs into innovative solutions. This stands true both in the products we offer and in our corporate philanthropy work. Our charitable giving programs operate under the Quidel Community Action Review and Endowment Squad (“QCARES”) committee, which is responsible for quarterly review and approval of proposed charitable contributions. Our charitable giving programs and activities consist of the following:
•Matching gifts — We match charitable contributions by full-time, regular employees to qualifying non-profit organizations of up to $250 per employee annually.
•Volunteer incentive program — When an employee volunteers at an organization for a minimum of 20 hours in a calendar year, we donate $100 to that organization.
•General QCARES fund — We may donate up to $2,000 to an organization proposed by an employee.
•Community partnerships — As part of our commitment to expanding equitable access to healthcare, we have partnered with several major organizations to donate COVID-19 testing products to various communities across the nation to promote increased testing within communities to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Employee Benefits 
To succeed in a competitive labor market, we have recruitment and retention strategies that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business, including designing our compensation and benefits programs to be competitive and align with our strategic and stockholders’ interests. Some of our key employee benefits include eligibility for health insurance, vacation time, a retirement plan with an employer match, an employee assistance program and life and disability coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including flexible spending accounts, hospital care, accident insurance, prepaid legal benefits, backup childcare, family forming benefits, homework support for students, student loan benefits, tuition reimbursement and a wellness program. These benefits are designed to offer employees a menu of options so that each employee can select benefits most meaningful to their personal situation. We consider our employee benefits to be an important component of total compensation for our employees.
ESG Strategy
We advance diagnostics to improve the health and well-being of people around the globe. Through diagnostic innovation, we strive toward our vision of a world where everyone has access to high-quality, easy-to-use, and affordable tests that ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes. To us, sustainability means using our talent and hard work to do the most good.
Our ESG strategy focuses on three pillars: fostering a culture of happy people, operating responsibly, and driving equitable healthcare. We are committed to providing immediate and frequent access to highly accurate, affordable testing for our customers and maintaining the highest ethical standards for our suppliers, stockholders, collaborators, and employees.
