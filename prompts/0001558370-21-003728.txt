ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Overview
RH (collectively, “we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a leading luxury retailer in the home furnishings market. Our curated and fully-integrated assortments are presented consistently across our sales channels in sophisticated and unique lifestyle settings. We offer dominant merchandise assortments across a number of categories, including furniture, lighting, textiles, bathware, décor, outdoor and garden, and child and teen furnishings. We position our Galleries as showrooms for our brand, while our websites and Source Books act as virtual extensions of our physical spaces. Our retail business is fully integrated across our multiple channels of distribution, consisting of our retail locations, websites and Source Books. We have an integrated RH Hospitality experience in ten of our Design Gallery locations, which includes Restaurants and wine bars.
As of January 30, 2021, we operated a total of 68 RH Galleries consisting of 24 Design Galleries, 38 legacy Galleries, 2 RH Modern Galleries and 4 RH Baby & Child Galleries throughout the United States and Canada, and 14 Waterworks Showrooms throughout the United States and in the U.K. As of January 30, 2021, we operated 38 outlet stores throughout the United States and Canada.
In fiscal 2020, we entered into equity method investments in connection with real estate development initiatives in Aspen, Colorado. The investments include properties that will be developed into retail locations, hospitality concepts, residential developments and workforce housing projects. We have also selected Aspen as the location to develop the first RH Ecosystem inclusive of an RH Bespoke Gallery, RH Guesthouse, RH Bath House & Spa, RH Restaurants and our first RH Residences. We plan to operate the RH branded businesses and be a real estate investor and partner for the remaining properties.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused disruption to our business operations as we temporarily closed all of our retail locations and Restaurants in the first fiscal quarter of 2020. Our response to the pandemic evolved quickly as our business trends substantially improved during the second through fourth fiscal quarters of 2020 as a result of both the reopening of most of our retail locations and also strong consumer demand for our products. As of March 24, 2021 we had reopened all of our Galleries and Outlets, and nine out of ten of our Restaurants although many of our Restaurants are continuing to conduct business under occupancy limitations or other operational restrictions. For more information, refer to Item 1A—Risk Factors—The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant and widespread risks to our business as well as to the business environment and the markets in which we operate and Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview.
Key Value Driving Strategies
In order to drive growth across our business, we are focused on the following long-term key strategies and business initiatives:
Product Elevation. Our goal is to establish RH as the undisputed design and quality leader of the luxury home furnishings sector. We have multiple growth initiatives and innovations that will further elevate the design and quality of every product category as we climb the luxury mountain and continue to differentiate our products in the market, including the introduction of RH Couture Upholstery and RH Bespoke, over the next several years. 
​
Assortment Expansion. We are expanding our assortment and introducing new concepts to increase market share and brand awareness. This will include the launch of RH Contemporary in 2021, a new collection that bridges the gap between RH Interiors and RH Modern, while elevating our brand and expanding our market, and RH Color in the next several years. 
​
Gallery Transformation. Our product is elevated and rendered more valuable by our architecturally inspiring Galleries. We believe our strategy to open new Design Galleries in every major market will unlock the value of our vast assortment, generating a revenue opportunity for our business of $5 to $6 billion in North America. We believe we can significantly increase our sales by transforming our real estate platform from our existing legacy retail footprint to a portfolio of Design Galleries that is sized to the potential of each market and the size of our assortment. In addition, we plan to incorporate Hospitality into most of the new Design Galleries that we open in the future, which further elevates and renders our product and brand more valuable. We believe Hospitality has created a unique new retail experience that cannot be replicated online, and that the addition of Hospitality will help drive incremental sales of home furnishings in these Galleries.

​
Global Expansion. We believe that our luxury brand positioning and unique aesthetic has strong international appeal, and that pursuit of global expansion will provide RH access to a substantial long-term market opportunity to build a $20 to $25 billion global brand over time. As such, we are actively pursuing expanding the RH brand globally with the objective of launching international locations in Europe beginning in 2022. We have secured a number of locations in various markets in the United Kingdom and continental Europe in which we expect to introduce our first Galleries outside of the U.S. and Canada.
​
Brand Elevation. Our vision is to move the brand beyond curating and selling product to conceptualizing and selling spaces by building an ecosystem of products, places, services and spaces that elevate and establish the RH brand as a global thought leader, taste and place maker. Our ecosystem, with its immersive experiences, exposes existing and new customers to our evolving authority in design, architecture and hospitality while acting as a next-generation brand elevation and marketing strategy. 
​
Digital Reimagination. We are reimagining our website into the World of RH, a digital portal presenting our products, places, services and spaces. This will enable existing and new customers to experience the immersive and multi-dimensional World of RH, inclusive of Our Products: Interiors, Modern, Contemporary, Color, Beach House, Ski House, Baby & Child, TEEN and Waterworks; Our Places: Galleries, Guesthouses, Restaurants and Residences; Our Services: Interior Design, Architecture and Landscape Architecture; and Our Spaces: Plane and Yacht Design and Charter.
​
Business Optimization. We continue to evolve our operating platform to elevate the customer experience and enhance decision-making. These efforts include initiatives such as (i) RH In-Your-Home, a reimagined home delivery experience that sets a new standard for “white glove” delivery and extends the Gallery into the customer’s home, (ii) the opening of a new LA-based distribution center, which will allow us to reduce delivery times by seven to ten days for both outdoor furniture and special order upholstery in most major markets, and (iii) an internal digital transformation that will leapfrog the way we work and drive significant productivity in the product development process, which will begin with the reimagination of the Center of Innovation and Product Leadership.
Products and Product Development
We have positioned RH as a lifestyle brand and design authority by offering expansive merchandise assortments. We are merchants of luxury home furnishings and our products embody our design aesthetic and reflect inspiration from across the centuries and around the globe.
We have developed a proprietary product development platform that is fully integrated from ideation to presentation. Key aspects of our product development platform are:
Organization—We have established a collaborative, cross-functional organization centered on product leadership and coordinated across our product development, sourcing, merchandising, inventory and creative teams. Our product teams are focused on maximizing the sales potential of each product category across all channels, which eliminates channel conflicts and functional redundancies.
Process—For many of our products, we work closely with our network of artisan partners who possess specialized product development and manufacturing capabilities and who we consider an extension of our product development team. We collaborate with our global network of specialty vendors and manufacturers to produce artisanal pieces of high quality and value on a large scale, including both distinctive original designs and reinterpretations of antiques.
Facility—We have built the RH Center of Innovation & Product Leadership, a facility which supports the entire product development process from product ideation to presentation for all channels.
As a result of our proprietary organization, process and facility, our typical product lead times are 3 – 9 months, which enhances our ability to introduce more new products with each collection. In addition, our product development platform, sourcing capabilities and significant scale enable us to reduce our product costs.

Sales Channels
We distribute our products through a fully integrated sales platform comprised of our retail locations, including RH Galleries and Waterworks Showrooms, websites, Source Books, Trade and Contract and Outlets. We believe the level of integration among all of our channels and our approach to the market distinguishes us from other retailers. Our channels complement each other and our customers’ buying decisions are influenced by their experiences across more than one of our sales channels. We encourage our customers to shop across our channels and have aligned our business and internal organization to be channel agnostic. Our integrated distribution and product delivery network serves all of our channels. We believe the key advantage of our multiple sales channels is our ability to leverage the unique attributes of each channel in our approach to the market.
Retail Locations
As of January 30, 2021, our retail locations are comprised of RH Galleries and Waterworks Showrooms:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

(1) | Average leased selling square footage is calculated based on total leased selling square footage divided by total locations. Leased selling square footage is retail space at our retail locations used to sell our products, as well as space for our restaurants. Leased selling square footage excludes backrooms at retail locations used for storage, office space, food preparation, kitchen space or similar purpose, as well as exterior sales space located outside a retail location, such as courtyards, gardens and rooftops.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Galleries are located in upscale malls and street locations, as well as in iconic locations. We believe situating our Galleries in desirable locations is critical to the success of our business. New sites are identified based on a variety of factors, such as (i) the availability of suitable new site locations based on several store specific factors including geographic location, demographics, and proximity to affluent consumers, (ii) the ability to negotiate favorable economic terms, as well as (iii) the satisfactory and timely completion of real estate development including procurement of permits and completion of construction. We pursue a market-based sales strategy, whereby we assess each market’s overall sales potential and how best to approach the market across all of our channels. We customize square footage, as well as catalog circulation, to maximize each market’s sales potential and increase our return on invested capital.
Our Galleries reinforce our luxury brand aesthetic and are highly differentiated from other home furnishings retailers. We have revolutionized the customer experience by showcasing products in a sophisticated lifestyle setting, consistent with the imagery and product presentation featured on our websites and in our catalogs. Products in our Galleries are presented in fully appointed rooms, emphasizing collections over individual pieces. This presentation encourages a higher average order value as our customers are inspired to consider purchasing a full collection of products to replicate the design aesthetic experienced in our Galleries. In addition, our associates use iPads and other devices to allow customers to shop our entire merchandise assortment while in a retail location.
As of January 30, 2021, ten of our RH Design Galleries included an integrated RH Hospitality experience, which includes Restaurants and wine bars. We believe this has created a unique new retail experience that cannot be replicated online, and that the addition of hospitality is helping to drive incremental sales of home furnishings in these Galleries. We plan to incorporate hospitality into most of the new Galleries that we open in the future.
We have identified key learnings from our real estate transformation that have supported the development of a multi-tier market approach described below that we believe will optimize both market share and return on invested capital.

​



First, we have developed prototype Design Galleries that are innovative and flexible blueprints which enable us to more quickly place our disruptive product assortment and immersive retail experience into the market. The new model is a standard we will continue to utilize and is based on key learnings from more recent Design Gallery openings. The prototype has approximately 40,000 leased selling square feet, inclusive of our integrated hospitality experience, and presents our assortments across our businesses and contains interior design offices and presentation rooms where design professionals can work with clients on their projects. This new model is more capital efficient and accelerates the development process. We anticipate the prototype Design Galleries will represent the format of most of our upcoming Design Galleries in North America. Our most recently opened Design Galleries in Charlotte and Marin are prototype Design Galleries, and upcoming prototype locations include Jacksonville, Florida, Dallas, Texas and Oak Brook, Illinois, which are expected to open in fiscal 2021.
Second, we will continue to develop and open larger Bespoke Design Galleries in the top metropolitan markets, similar to those we opened in New York and Chicago. These iconic locations are highly profitable statements for our brand, and we believe they create a long-term competitive advantage that will be difficult to duplicate. We expect to open our Bespoke Design Gallery in San Francisco, California in fiscal 2021.
Third, we will continue to open indigenous Bespoke Galleries in the best second home markets where the wealthy and affluent visit and vacation. These Galleries are tailored to reflect the local culture and are sized to the potential of each market. Examples of current indigenous Bespoke Galleries include our location in Yountville, California as well as our Gallery under development in Aspen, Colorado.
We believe our multi-tier market approach to transforming our real estate will enable us to open five to seven new Galleries per year over time but the cadence of our new Gallery development has been slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We plan to expand our product sales to additional international markets and have signed leases for Design Galleries in several locations outside of North America, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany.

----+-----------------------------------------------------

We continually analyze opportunities to selectively consolidate retail locations in connection with openings of our Design Galleries or close retail locations that have been under-performing or are no longer consistent with our brand positioning. In many cases, we continue to operate a retail location until our lease has expired in order to effect the closure in a cost-efficient manner.
Websites
Our primary RH websites, www.rh.com, www.rhmodern.com, www.rhbabyandchild.com and www.rhteen.com, provide our customers with the ability to chat with a designer and purchase our merchandise online. We sell Waterworks products online through www.waterworks.com.
Our websites allow our customers to experience the unique lifestyle settings reflected in our catalogs and throughout our Galleries and Showrooms, and to shop all of our current product assortment. We update our websites regularly to reflect new products, product availability and occasional special offers.
The RH websites also offer room-based navigation, which allows the customer to envision and shop items by room or by product, expanding on the richness of the online experience. Customers can search the websites for products by size or color, browse through our extensive product categories and see detailed information about each item and collection, such as dimensions, materials and care instructions. Additionally, customers can select color swatches and view merchandise displayed with different color and fabric options.

Source Books
We produce a series of catalogs, which we refer to as Source Books, to showcase our merchandise assortment. Our Source Books include RH Interiors, RH Modern, RH Outdoor, RH Baby & Child and TEEN, RH Beach House, RH Ski House and RH Rugs, and we expect to launch RH Contemporary in fiscal 2021. Our Source Books are one of our primary branding and advertising vehicles. We have found that merchandise assortments displayed in our Source Books contribute to increased sales of those products across all of our channels. As in our Galleries, our Source Books present our merchandise in lifestyle settings that reflect our unique design aesthetic. Our Source Books also feature profiles of select artisan vendors and other compelling editorial content regarding home décor. All creative work on our Source Books is coordinated in-house in our RH Center of Innovation & Product Leadership, providing us greater control over the brand image presented to our customers, while also reducing our Source Book production costs.
Our Source Book mailings serve as a key driver of sales through both our retail locations and websites. Our customers respond to the Source Books across all of our channels, with sales trends closely correlating to the assortments that we emphasize and feature prominently in our Source Books, websites and Galleries. We continue to evaluate and optimize our Source Book strategy based on our experience.
We maintain a database of customer information, including customer information from our RH Members Program, which includes sales patterns, detailed purchasing information and certain demographic information, as well as mailing and email addresses. We mail our Source Books to addresses within this database and to addresses provided to us by third parties. The database supports our ability to analyze our customers’ buying behaviors across sales channels and facilitates the development of targeted marketing strategies and is maintained in accordance with our privacy policy disclosed on our website. We segment our customer files based on multiple variables, and we tailor our Source Book mailings and emails in response to the purchasing patterns and product needs of our customers. We focus on continually improving the segmentation of customer files and the expansion of our customer database.
Our Source Books, in concert with our websites, are a cost-effective means to test new products, and allow us to launch categories in a disciplined, expeditious and cost-effective manner. 
Trade and Contract
In addition to our core channels, we continue to expand into B2B channels, including Trade and Contract. In the Trade channel, we work directly with residential interior designers and decorators purchasing products for their clients’ residential projects. We also sell directly to consumers who make purchases with the assistance of their residential interior designer or decorator. Our Contract business supplies products to large-scale, luxury hospitality, commercial and residential development projects globally, working directly with hotel ownership groups and brands, commercial property owners, single-family and multi-family builders and developers and their ecosystem of architecture, interior design and purchasing business partners. These channels enable us to reach new business customers and the consumers they influence.
Outlet Stores 
Our outlet stores are branded as RH Outlet or Restoration Hardware Outlet and are typically located in outlet malls. Our outlet stores serve as a key part of our reverse logistics platform and provide an efficient means to sell primarily returned merchandise and, to a lesser extent, discontinued and overstock merchandise outside of our core sales channels. As of January 30, 2021, we operated 38 outlet stores.
Marketing and Advertising
Our Galleries, websites and Source Books are the primary branding and advertising vehicles for the RH brands. In addition, we employ a variety of marketing and advertising vehicles to drive customer traffic across all our channels, strengthen and reinforce our brand image and acquire new customers. These include targeted Source Book circulation, email communications, promotional mailings, print advertisements, and public relations activities and events. We use our customer database to tailor our programs and increase the efficiency of our marketing and promotion initiatives. We leverage our marketing and advertising expenses across all our channels as we seek to optimize the efficiency of our investment.

The highly-differentiated design aesthetic and environment of our Galleries drives customer traffic not only to our physical spaces but also to our websites. Our Source Books and targeted emails further reinforce the RH brand image and drive sales across all of our sales channels. We also participate in a wide range of other marketing, promotional and public relations activities to promote our brands. These campaigns include media coverage in design, lifestyle, culture/society and specialty publications, as well as in-gallery events related to new gallery openings and product launches. In addition, we engage in print advertising in brand-relevant publications such as Architectural Digest, Elle Décor, Town and Country, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, WSJ. Magazine and others. We believe that these efforts drive increased brand awareness, leading to higher sales over time.
RH Members Program
The RH Members Program reimagines and simplifies the shopping experience. For an annual fee, the RH Members Program provides a set discount every day across all RH brands, excluding RH Hospitality and Waterworks, in addition to other benefits including complimentary interior design services through the RH Interior Design program and eligibility for preferred financing plans on the RH Credit Card, among other benefits. The RH Members Program allows our customers to shop for what they want, when they want, and receive the greatest value, which has resulted in orders and sales being more evenly distributed throughout the year as opposed to the peaks and valleys of orders and sales we experienced under the prior promotional model. For the year ended January 30, 2021, our members drove approximately 97% of sales in our core RH business, and we had approximately 434,000 members at year end. Our core RH business reflects the product categories that the membership discount can be applied to, and as a result sales generated via Outlet, Contract, Hospitality or Waterworks are excluded. We believe our membership model enhances the customer experience, renders our brand more valuable, improves operational execution, and reduces costs.
Sourcing
Our sourcing strategy focuses on identifying and using vendors that can provide the quality materials and fine craftsmanship that our customers expect of our brand. To ensure that our high standards of quality and timely delivery of merchandise are met, we work closely with vendors and manufacturers. We seek to ensure the consistent quality of our manufacturers’ products by selectively inspecting pre-production samples, conducting periodic site visits to certain of our vendors’ production facilities and selectively inspecting inbound shipments at our distribution facilities. In fiscal 2020, we sourced approximately 75% of our purchase dollar volume from approximately 30 vendors. In fiscal 2020, one vendor accounted for approximately 11% of our purchase dollar volume. Based on total dollar volume of purchases for fiscal 2020, approximately 72% of our products were sourced from Asia, with 35% sourced from China, 15% from the United States and the remainder from other countries and regions. In addition, we perform limited manufacturing activities in the United States.
We have a limited number of long-term merchandise supply contracts, but we believe that we generally have strong relationships with our product vendors. Although we transact business primarily on an order-by-order basis, we typically work with most of our vendors over extended periods of time, and many vendors are making long-term capacity investments to serve our increasing demands. Over the last several years, we engaged in a sourcing initiative to develop closer relationships with our vendors in order to achieve better efficiencies and further improve our product development process. Through this process, we have eliminated the use of most third-party purchasing agents in favor of a model in which we directly manage our vendors. We have achieved significant cost savings and other efficiencies from this initiative.
Distribution and Delivery
We manage the distribution and delivery of our products through our distribution centers. We currently operate two furniture fulfillment centers and one small parcel fulfillment center servicing RH products, which are located strategically in three markets throughout the United States. We have signed a lease for a third furniture fulfillment center in the Los Angeles market, which is expected to be operational in the spring of 2021. We have one fulfillment center in the United States servicing Waterworks products.

We operate portions of our home delivery services in 16 key markets to leverage operating costs and improve our customers’ delivery experience, while reducing returns and damage to our products. We offer a white glove home delivery service for our larger merchandise and furniture categories, where third-party personnel deliver fully assembled items to the location of our customers’ choice. We believe there is an opportunity to improve the customer experience by taking greater control of the home delivery experience over time. We believe that many third-party furniture delivery providers are designed to support mass and mid-market companies and that significant opportunity exists for developing improved solutions for the luxury market. We believe we have dramatically enhanced the customer experience while reducing return rates, damages and deliveries per order by enhancing the quality of our delivery providers through metric-based accountability standards.
Through our distribution center network redesign, reverse logistics and outlet redesign, and the reconceptualization of home delivery, we have improved our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, and have built a scalable infrastructure to support our future growth. We believe our enhanced supply chain and fulfillment operations allow us to manage customer orders and distribute merchandise to our customers in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We also believe that these upgrades have improved customer satisfaction by reducing delivery times, reducing damage to merchandise, and improving our customer’s overall buying experience.
Competition
The home furnishings sector is highly competitive. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of the design, style and quality of our products and the luxury positioning of our brand, including our customer service. We believe that customers respond favorably to the style and presentation of our products and that we offer consumers a substantial assortment of curated merchandise selections as part of a lifestyle experience. We are continuing to elevate our product and create separation between our brand and that of many of our competitors. We believe that we compete effectively on the basis of our luxury brand, the breadth of our assortment of high-quality merchandise and the pricing of our products.
We compete with the interior design trade and specialty stores, as well as antique dealers and other merchants that provide unique items and custom-designed product offerings at higher price points, by providing a broader product assortment at an exceptional value based both upon the price and quality of our products. We also compete with national and regional home furnishing retailers and department stores, in addition to mail order catalogs and online retailers focused on home furnishings, by offering what we believe is superior quality, highly distinctive design styles and a sophisticated lifestyle presentation in our product offering. 
We also believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to originate and define product trends, as well as to timely anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. However, many smaller specialty retailers may lack the financial resources, infrastructure, scale and national brand identity necessary to compete effectively with us. We believe we are effectively positioned to gain market share from both of these segments and drive growth.
Human Capital
As of January 30, 2021, we had approximately 5,000 employees, of which approximately 500 were part-time employees. As of that date, approximately 2,200 of our employees were based in our retail locations and outlets. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
The success of our business depends upon our ability to retain continued service of certain key personnel, particularly our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gary Friedman, and to attract, retain and motivate qualified leaders throughout our Company, as well as qualified associates across all parts of our organization, including Galleries, Restaurants, distribution centers, home delivery centers and customer care centers. Our goal is to have the most qualified person in every position throughout our organization. As we are headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, a highly dynamic and competitive market for talent, we seek to provide competitive compensation for our people in order to attract and retain the best available talent.
We do not discriminate against any applicant or associate and have a policy outlining these principles. This policy governs all aspects of employment, including recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, discipline, job assignments, benefits, transfer and discharge. We maintain a diverse workforce. RH is an equal opportunity employer, and we believe in meritocratic hiring. We strongly believe our performance is enhanced by a workforce comprised of individuals with diverse backgrounds, skills and experience that align with the needs of our business.

Our culture is driven by our Chairman and CEO and the senior leadership team, who instill a company-wide commitment to our values of People, Quality, Service and Innovation. We believe our distinct corporate culture allows us to attract highly talented individuals who are passionate, driven, and who share our vision. We expect our values to be maintained throughout our business, including our supply chain. We require our vendors to adhere to our Vendor Code of Conduct, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at ir.rh.com under “Governance / Environmental, Social & Governance.”
In April 2020, we announced organizational changes and expense reductions in response to business conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary furlough of team members, the termination of certain jobs, and temporary salary reductions for the substantial majority of leadership positions across the Company. While we have subsequently discontinued the furlough and salary reductions measures, our workforce continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. At various times since the beginning of the pandemic, substantially all of our leadership team, including those in our corporate office in Corte Madera, California, have been subject to state and local shelter-in-place requirements, which have varied over time and resulted in most of our associates being required to work remotely. We are committed to operating our environments with the highest safety standards to ensure the health and well-being of our guests and team members. As of March 24, 2021, we had reopened all of our Galleries and Outlets, and nine out of ten of our Restaurants, with adjusted hours and CDC-recommended safety measures in place. We perform health checks for all associates entering our locations each day, and require all customers and associates to wear masks and adhere to all CDC guidelines for cleaning and social distancing protocols.

Fluctuation in Quarterly Results
Our quarterly results vary depending upon a variety of factors, including changes in our product offerings and the introduction of new merchandise assortments and categories, the opening of new retail location, shifts in the timing of various events quarter over quarter including holidays and other events such as retail location and outlet closures, the timing of Source Book releases, promotional events and the timing and extent of our realization of the costs and benefits of our numerous strategic initiatives, among other things. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands may fluctuate during the year. For example, we experienced significant fluctuations in our revenue growth over the last several years including within the quarters during fiscal 2020, which were affected by a variety of factors related to the overall operating environment including the impact of the pandemic on various parts of our operations. In addition, we have historically experienced some seasonality in our business trends as our sales are typically higher in the second fiscal quarter, which correlates to a peak selling season for outdoor items including outdoor furniture. Unique factors in any given quarter may affect period-to-period comparisons between the quarters being compared, and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year.
