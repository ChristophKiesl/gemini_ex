Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a fiber broadband and managed IT services provider, offering technology and service enabled customer solutions to business and wholesale customers in and out of Alaska. We also provide telecommunication services to consumers in the most populated communities throughout the state. Our facilities-based communications network extends through the economically significant portions of Alaska and connects to the contiguous states via our two diverse undersea fiber optic cable systems. Our network is among the most expansive in Alaska and forms the foundation of service to our customers. We operate in a largely two-player terrestrial wireline market and we estimate our market share to be less than 25% statewide. A third-party market study conducted in the fourth quarter of 2018 indicates that we have market share of close to 40% for “near net” opportunities, that is, within one mile of our fiber network.
Merger
 

On December 31, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Project 8 Buyer, LLC (“Parent”) and Project 8 Merger Sub (“Merger Sub”), two newly- formed entities owned by ATN International, Inc. and Freedom 3 Capital, LLC. On December 31, 2020, the Company terminated the previously announced merger agreement under which the Company would be acquired by Macquarie Capital (USA) and GCM Grosvenor through its Labor Impact Fund.
 
On the terms, and subject to the conditions, of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. As a result of the Merger, each share of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) (other than shares held by (i) the Company, Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) stockholders of the Company who have validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive $3.40 in cash, without interest, subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the “Merger Consideration”).
 
    5 

  

Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, without limitation, (i) approval of the Merger by the Company’s stockholders, (ii) absence of certain legal impediments, (iii) the expiration or termination of the required waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”); and (iv) receipt of regulatory approvals from the Federal Communications Commissions (the “FCC”) (and, if required as a precondition for FCC approval, the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the U.S. Telecommunications Services Sector (“Team Telecom Committee”)) and from the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (the “RCA”). The waiting period under the HSR Act expired on February 16, 2021 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.  Filings with each of the FCC and the RCA were made on January 20, 2021. The RCA gave public notice of the application and requested any public comments by February 12, 2021. On February 8, 2021, the RCA issued an order stating that it had determined that Parent’s application to acquire the Company was complete as filed on January 20, 2021. The order states that the RCA will issue a final order no later than July 19, 2021. The Company’s stockholders approved the Merger at a special meeting of stockholders held on March 12, 2021.
 
Certain terms of the Merger Agreement are summarized below. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Merger Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 31, 2020 and filed with the SEC on January 4, 2021, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units
 
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award issued under the stock plan of the Company that is subject solely to time-based vesting (a “Company RSU Award”) and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, will be cancelled as of the Effective Time in exchange for an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration. Amounts payable with respect to the Company RSU Awards will be paid not later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least two business days following the closing of the Merger Agreement.
 
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award issued under the stock plan of the Company that is subject solely to performance-based vesting (the “Company PSU Awards”) and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled as of the Effective Time in exchange for an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to any Company PSU Awards will be determined based on the degree of achievement of the performance goals set forth in the applicable award agreement as of the Effective Time or such earlier time as determined by the compensation committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and such Company PSU Awards will no longer be subject to any performance-based vesting conditions. Amounts payable with respect to Company PSU Awards that are subject to vesting based on the price of Company Common Stock will be paid not later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least two business days following the closing of the Merger Agreement, and amounts payable with respect to all other Company PSU Awards will be paid not later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least two business days following the earliest of (a) the applicable time-based vesting date of the canceled Company PSU Award, (b) the date that is one year following the Effective Time, and (c) the termination of the employment of the former holder of such Company PSU Award without “cause,” in any case without interest.
 
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock granted to the directors of the Company that is subject to a deferral election (a “Deferred Stock Award”) and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled as of the Effective Time in exchange for an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Deferred Stock Award by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

Financing
 
Parent and Merger Sub secured committed financing, consisting of a combination of (i) equity financing (the “Equity Financing”) to be provided by ATN International, Inc. and Freedom 3 Investments IV, LP, which have each agreed to capitalize Parent, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in equity commitment letters with respect to the Merger and (ii) debt financing (the “Debt Financing”) to be provided by Fifth Third Bank, National Association, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the debt financing commitment letter with respect to the Merger. The Equity Financing and the Debt Financing, in the aggregate, will be sufficient for Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay the amounts required to be paid in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Merger is not subject to a financing condition. The Equity Investors have also entered into limited guarantees with the Company to guarantee Parent’s obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and certain indemnity and recovery costs.
 
No-Shop Period
 
From and after the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will be subject to customary “no-shop” restrictions, subject to certain exceptions and “fiduciary out” provisions, as set forth in the Merger Agreement.
 
Termination
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for the Company and Parent. Among other termination rights, the Merger Agreement can be terminated by either Parent or the Company if (i) the Merger is not consummated on or before December 31, 2021 (the “End Date”), which may be extended in increments of 30 days to no later than February 28, 2022 in connection with regulatory approvals, or (ii) any governmental authority of the United States or certain localities within the United States issues a final and non-appealable order permanently restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
 
In addition, the Merger Agreement includes certain termination fees payable by the Company or Parent if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.
 
Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to a standstill pursuant to the Merger Agreement, with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, from December 31, 2020 until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the first anniversary of the termination of the Merger Agreement.
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this nature.
 
The Merger is currently expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, although there can be no assurance that it will occur by that date. The transaction will result in the Company becoming a consolidated, majority owned subsidiary of ATN International, Inc.
 
COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted global, national and local economies, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruptions to financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted the Company’s customers, suppliers, employees and other aspects of its business, including an increase in demand for its broadband and managed IT services. In response to economic pressures impacting the Company’s customers and the community at large as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented the following actions in 2020:

● | Working to increase bandwidth, as needed, for participants in the rural health care program at no charge to the customer. Timing is subject to FCC guidance and its waiver of certain rules.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    7 

  


● | Offered kindergarten through grade 12, university students and teachers who do not have internet service, unlimited internet service at no charge through the end of the spring semester of the 2019-2020 school year.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Not terminating service to residential and small business customers in the event they are unable to pay us for services due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Waiving late fees incurred by residential and small business customers resulting from their economic circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Waiving long distance overage fees, as appropriate, related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extension of technical support hours.
--+--------------------------------------


● | Proactively monitoring our network and prioritizing the augmentation of network links.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Working with local and state utilities, governments and educational institutions to ensure they have the necessary resources.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Established remote working arrangements, including work-from-home, for most of our administrative employees.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementation of travel restrictions.
--+---------------------------------------


● | Established appropriate arrangements for our customer service representatives and customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proactively assessing and managing facilities and other costs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | In July, offered a one-time cash incentive to employees who volunteered to retire or otherwise terminate their employment, subject to management approval. This offer was made, in part, to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our financial results. The total cost of this program was $0.2 million and is not included in incremental costs associated with COVID-19 described in “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a direct material effect on the Company’s revenue in 2020 but did directly result in an estimated $1.5 million increase in costs during that period. Additional current and potential financial impacts include the following:
 

● | The estimated fair value of service or upgraded service provided to customers without charge was $2.2 million in 2020. These services were not recorded as revenue because no cash was expected to be collected from the customer. The Company’s incremental cost of providing this service was not significant.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementation of certain agreements with other carriers under which the Company is a lessee and lessor of dark fiber have been delayed from the fourth quarter of 2020 to 2021.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Certain customers have delayed orders for the provision of service.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As a result of the customer accommodations noted above, collection of account receivable from certain customers has been delayed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disruption of certain of our business and wholesale customers’ operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disruption of the Alaska economy, including crude oil prices and the leisure and hospitality industries, could negatively impact demand for our products and services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reductions in consumer spending.
--+---------------------------------


● | Government imposed travel restrictions and other actions could reduce the efficiency of our operations and result in higher costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Declines in revenue and cash flows could require that we further reduce operating cost and capital spending.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Delays, cancellation and other disruptions in the provision of products and services by our vendors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disruption to the financial markets could limit our access to financing and other sources of capital.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are continuing to assess the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The situation continues to evolve, and we cannot predict the extent or duration of the pandemic, its effects on the global, national or local economy and its longer-term effects on the demand for our products and services, operations, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which could be material. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and make the appropriate adjustments to our operations as required and appropriate.

In March 2020, the Federal government passed legislation, including the CARES Act, intended to provide economic relief to individuals, families and businesses. This relief includes cash payments, additional unemployment benefits, grants, forgivable loans and additional funding (through the FCC) for telemedicine services and devices. The FCC has also relaxed competitive bidding rules and delayed certain deadlines under the E-Rate and rural health care programs. The CARES Act has provided for the accelerated receipt of the Company’s AMT credits.
 
In February 2021, the Company and the Municipality of Anchorage entered into an agreement under which utility relief will be made available to certain of the Company’s residential and small business customers located in Anchorage. The program is supported by a grant from the Municipality of Anchorage. These funds will be applied by the Company to the accounts of customers who have experienced financial hardship related to the COVID-19 pandemic and meet other requirements, subject to certain terms and conditions. Maximum funding under the grant is $0.7 million and will be recorded as a credit to accounts receivable and, in part, to the provision for doubtful accounts in 2021.
 
Operating Initiatives
 
We are focused on being a customer centric fiber broadband and managed IT company. Everything we do is focused around our customer, meeting and exceeding their needs through the application of technology. We are focused on delivering an exceptional customer experience throughout the customer lifecycle. This forms the foundation of our sustained differentiation, creating unique value for our customers to grow our market share, expand business with existing customers while minimizing churn.
 
Our future investments and subsequent initiatives are focused on building and strengthening the business in three areas:
 

● | Enhance and Augment our Network and Capabilities: This is what we do and is the basis of our offers, to lead the competition through innovation and leverage the latest technologies to meet our customer’s needs. Activities include investments to grow our fiber footprint, augmented with high speed fixed wireless technologies, as well as expanding our product capabilities that fully leverage our existing and growing fiber footprint.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drive Operational Excellence: Invest in operational systems that fundamentally change the way we deliver services that both enhance the customer experience as well as increase efficiency and productivity, redefining processes throughout the entire customer lifecycle to create new operating models and efficiencies. Investments that update our operational support and billing systems provide the foundational platform to further leverage digital technologies and expand with investments in analytics and artificial intelligence.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerate the Growth of Managed IT Services: This is a fragmented market without a leader, a significant market size and a set of services that are both adjacent and synergistic with communications and networking services. We continue to invest in winning share and expanding our capabilities, enabling and accelerating our customers’ transition to cloud services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These investment areas are not standalone and, in fact, are synergistic. We look to maximize each of these with any initiative for the highest return.
 
We recognize that everything we do is only possible through our people. Our employees are enablers that make any and all initiatives happen to serve our customers and earn their business. We focus on and make investments in employee engagement to maximize the realization of an exceptional customer experience and maximize the effectiveness of our investments.
 
We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that address scale, geographic diversification, and return value to our shareholders.

The brand pillars supporting our products and services are reliability, customer service, trustworthiness and local presence. These are represented by the promise we make to our customers: “You can always expect to get the service as promised to you by an Alaska Communications’ representative. If you are not satisfied, we will work with you to provide a solution that meets your satisfaction.”
 
See “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for a description of our products and services and a summary of service and product revenues generated by each of the above three customer categories.
 
Network and Technology
 
Alaska Communications provides communications and IT solutions that connect Alaskans as well as customers in the continental United States to the world. This is based on an extensive facilities-based wireline telecommunications network in Alaska that we operate. We provide high-capacity data networking, internet connectivity, voice communications and IT Services. Networking services include Ethernet and IP routed services as well as switched and dedicated voice services. In addition, we offer other value-added services such as network hosting, managed IT services and long-distance services. We continuously upgrade our network to provide higher levels of performance, higher bandwidth speeds, increased levels of security and additional value-added services to our customers. We operate 181,000 terrestrial and submarine fiber miles which serve as the backbone of our network as well as now serving over 900 buildings with fiber. Our networks are monitored for performance around the clock in redundant monitoring centers to provide a high level of reliability and performance. Our network is extensive within Alaska’s urban areas and connects our largest markets, including Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau with each other and the contiguous states as well as many rural areas. We continue to utilize Fixed Wireless technology to reach even more customers, bringing total homes and businesses passed to more than 16,000 at the end of 2020. In 2020, we secured additional spectrum through the FCC auction for licenses in the shared Citizens Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”). CBRS spectrum is effective in areas with lower population densities. We also continue to expand our Multi-Dwelling Unit (“MDU”) offering utilizing fiber or fixed wireless backhaul, with more than 7,000 MDUs now served.
 
We own and operate two undersea fiber optic cable systems that diversely connect our Alaskan network to our facilities in Oregon and Washington. These facilities provide the most survivable service to and from Alaska, with key monitoring and disaster recovery capabilities for our customers. We also have usage rights on a third undersea fiber network connected to the lower-48.
 
Our network in Oregon and Washington includes terrestrial transport components linking our landing stations to a Network Operations Control Center in Hillsboro, Oregon and collocation facilities in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. In addition, AKORN®, one of our undersea fiber optic cable systems, connects our Alaska network from Homer, Alaska to our facilities in Florence, Oregon along a diverse path within Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and undersea in the Pacific Ocean. Northstar, our other undersea fiber optic system, has cable landing facilities in Whittier, Juneau, and Valdez, Alaska, and Nedonna Beach, Oregon. In 2020, we completed major network upgrades to the Northstar fiber line, increasing capacity by more than five times. Our subsea capacity including the AKORN® and Northstar systems provides a total of 7,800 route miles, or about 26,000 fiber miles, of submarine fiber. Together, these fiber optic cables provide extensive bandwidth as well as survivability protection designed to serve our own, as well as our most demanding customers’ critical communications requirements. In 2017, we upgraded the AKORN system to be able to support 100GB circuits for customers. Further upgrades to the AKORN system were completed in 2019. Through our landing stations in Oregon, we also provide an at-the-ready landing point for other large fiber optic cables, and their operators, connecting the U.S. to networks in Asia and other parts of the world.
 
Our terrestrial fiber network on the North Slope of Alaska allows us to provide broadband solutions to the oil and gas sector in a market that previously had no competition and continue to advance our sales of managed IT services.
 
We have developed a satellite earth station network and acquired C-band transponder space on Eutelsat’s E115WB satellite. We began providing Internet backhaul connectivity in 2017, and continue to expand the satellite service, adding customers and upgrading equipment throughout 2018, 2019 and 2020.
 
    10 

  

Another Alaska carrier, Quintillion, has invested in a submarine network with landing stations in several northwest Alaska communities, including a terrestrial route from the North Slope to Fairbanks. We have acquired capacity on this system and deliver service to customers in this area, including a buildout of terrestrial fiber optic cable, in Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow) to serve this new market. We are currently serving customers in Utqiaġvik, Nome, Kotzebue and Deadhorse.
 
Competition
 
Management estimates the Alaska wireline telecom and IT services market to be approximately $1.65 billion. This market is comprised of the IT services market of approximately $840 million, the broadband market of approximately $700 million and the voice market of approximately $110 million. Management estimates that over 85% of this market opportunity is from the business and wholesale customer segment. Based on a third-party market study conducted in the fourth quarter of 2018, management believes that approximately $250 million of the telecom opportunity is “near net,” that is, within one mile of our fiber infrastructure.
 
We expect to experience continued growth in managed IT services over time by providing these services to our broadband customers as well as creating new customer relationships. We believe the competition for managed IT services is fragmented.
 
We face strong competition in our markets from larger competitors with substantial resources. For traditional voice and broadband services, we compete with GCI and AT&T on a statewide basis, and smaller providers such as Matanuska Telephone Association, Inc. on a more localized basis.
 
As the largest facilities-based operator in Alaska, GCI is the dominant statewide provider of broadband, voice, wireless and video services. In the markets where we compete with GCI (broadband and voice), GCI has approximately 50% to 60% of market share across the consumer and business segments. GCI continues to expand its voice and data network, often taking advantage of subsidized government programs which create a monopoly for services in certain markets. AT&T’s primary focus is to be the provider of voice and broadband services to its nation-wide customers. AT&T tends to use its existing broadband network to serve these customers or it leases capacity from GCI or Alaska Communications to augment its existing network.
 
Matanuska Telephone Association (“MTA”) is a COOP owned telephone and internet service provider operating in the Matanuska regional area of Alaska. MTA is in the process of building a terrestrial fiber from Alaska to Canada which will interconnect with Northwestel. This fiber will provide a diverse route out of Alaska.
 
Overall competitive dynamics are significant, and our operating performance is impacted accordingly. For more information associated with the risks of our competitive environment see “Item 1A, Risk Factors.”
 
Marketing
 
Our marketing strategy relies on our understanding the Alaskan market, while increasingly using digital technologies to focus our marketing messages. We tailor our products and services based on understanding our customers’ needs, location, and type of service they desire. For business customers, we bundle our products and provide value added managed IT services using our local service delivery model and highly reliable network. For consumer customers, we focus on brand awareness, the product experience, providing improved service through new technology and price. Regarding pricing, we typically offer one flat rate price and no data usage caps for internet services, differentiating ourselves from GCI who charges for excess data usage or throttles bandwidth.
Sales and Distribution Channels
 
Our sales strategy combines primarily direct distribution channels to retain current customers and drive sales growth. In 2021, we will continue leveraging our direct sales channels’ focus on serving Business and Wholesale customers, our web and contact center channels for consumer customers, and expand our penetration of the military housing market for continued sustained performance. We are also continuing our efforts to improve customer service and move more consumer transactions to the web.
 
    11 

  

Customer Base
 
We generate our revenue through a diverse statewide customer base and there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of customers. Business and wholesale customers are our primary focus and they comprised 68% of our total revenue in 2020. Regulatory revenue and consumer revenue represented 17% and 15%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenue in 2020.
Seasonality
 
We believe our revenue is impacted by seasonal factors. This is due to Alaska’s northern latitude and the resulting wide swing in available daylight and weather conditions between summer and winter months. These conditions, unique to Alaska, affect business, tourism and telecom use patterns in the state. Our spending patterns are also impacted by seasonality as we incur more capital spending and operating spending during the summer and early fall periods of the year, reflecting the heightened economic activity from the summer months and our own construction activities during this time period.
Human Capital
 
Everything we do is only possible through our people. Our employees enable any and all initiatives to serve our customers and earn their business. We focus on and make investments in employee engagement to maximize the realization of an exceptional customer experience and maximize the effectiveness of our investments.
 
We depend on the availability of personnel with the requisite level of technical expertise in the telecommunications industry. Our ability to develop and maintain our networks and execute our business plan is dependent on the availability of technical engineering, IT, service delivery and monitoring, product development, sales, management, finance and other key personnel. Because our operations and customers are primarily based in Alaska, the recruiting and retention of employees can be challenging.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has established remote working arrangements, including work-from-home, for most of our administrative employees. Management has also implemented processes for frequent virtual interaction between individual employees and employee groups.
 
Our Collective Bargaining Agreement (“CBA”) with the IBEW, which is effective through December 31, 2023, governs the terms and conditions of employment for all IBEW represented employees working for us. The CBA has significant economic impacts on the Company as it relates to wage and benefit costs and work rules. We believe our labor costs are higher than our competitors who employ a non-unionized workforce. Work rules under the CBA limit our ability to efficiently manage our workforce and make the incremental cost of work performed outside normal work hours high.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 564 regular full-time employees, 5 regular part-time employees and 5 temporary employees, compared with 569, 8 and 4, respectively at December 31, 2019. Approximately 54% of our employees are represented by the IBEW.
 
Management considers employee relations to be generally good.
 
Regulation
 
While a substantial amount of our revenue is derived from non-regulated or non-common carrier services, we continue to generate revenue from services that are regulated. Given the breadth of the regulatory framework, the following summary of the regulatory environment in which our business operates does not describe all present and proposed federal, state and local legislation and regulations affecting the telecommunications industry in Alaska.
Overview
 
Some of the telecommunications services we provide are subject to federal, state and local regulation. These regulations govern, in part, our rates and the way we conduct our business. These requirements are subject to frequent change. Compliance is costly and limits our ability to respond to some of the demands of our increasingly competitive service markets.
 
We generate revenue from these regulated services through regulated charges to our retail and wholesale customers, access and other charges to other carriers, and federal and state universal service support mechanisms for telecommunications and broadband services. These revenues are recorded throughout our customer categories.
 
    12 

  

At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over the interstate and international telecommunications services that regulated common carriers provide and their related communications facilities.
 
The Regulatory Commission of Alaska (“RCA”) generally exercises jurisdiction over a limited number of intrastate access telecommunications services that originate and terminate at points in Alaska.
 
In this section, “Regulation”, we refer to our local exchange carrier (“LEC”) subsidiaries individually as follows:
 
● | ACS of Anchorage, LLC (“ACSA”);
--+--------------------------------


● | ACS of Alaska, LLC (“ACSAK”);
--+------------------------------


● | ACS of Fairbanks, LLC (“ACSF”); and
--+------------------------------------


● | ACS of the Northland, LLC (“ACSN”).
--+------------------------------------

Federal Regulation 
 
We must comply with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”) and regulations promulgated thereunder, which together require, among other things, that we offer regulated interstate telecommunications common carrier services at just, reasonable and non-discriminatory rates and terms. The Communications Act also requires us to offer competing carriers interconnection and non-discriminatory access to certain facilities and services designated as essential for local competition. Under the Communications Act we are eligible for support revenues to help defray the cost of providing services in rural, high cost areas, and to low-income consumers, schools and libraries, and rural health care providers. The FCC is continuing to propose changes in the size and scope of these mechanisms, and it is difficult to predict the impact such changes may have on our business.
Rate Regulation
 
Our LEC subsidiaries are regulated common carriers offering local voice and telecommunications data services. In providing regulated telecommunications services, these subsidiaries are subject to competitive market forces, as well as rate-of-return regulations for intrastate services that originate and terminate in Alaska and price-cap rate regulation for interstate services regulated by the FCC. Because they face competition, our LEC subsidiaries may not be able to charge their maximum permitted rates under price-cap regulation or realize their authorized intrastate rate of return. A broader range of data and information services are offered by our unregulated affiliates or as unregulated services by our regulated companies.
Interconnection with Local Telephone Companies and Access to Other Facilities 
 
The Communications Act imposes a number of requirements on LECs. Generally, a LEC must: interconnect with other telecommunications carriers; not prohibit or unreasonably restrict the resale of its services; provide for telephone number portability so customers may keep the same telephone number if they switch service providers; provide access to their poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way on a reasonable, non-discriminatory basis; and, when a call originates on its network, compensate other telephone companies for terminating or transporting the call (see the “Interstate Access” discussion below).
 
All of our LEC subsidiaries are considered incumbent LECs (“ILECs”) and have additional obligations under the Communications Act, including obligations to unbundle certain elements of their networks for purchase by competitive LECs.
 
    13 

  

In general, in recent years, the FCC has granted forbearance providing incremental relief from some of the obligations the Communications Act imposes uniquely on ILECs. Most recently, on October 28, 2020, the FCC released an Order relieving ILECs from most obligations to unbundle local loops (DS-3, DS-1, DS-0, and narrowband voice-grade), as well as Operations Support Systems and dark fiber transport, in markets the FCC deems competitive subject to transition periods ranging between two and eight years. Previously, on August 2, 2019, the FCC relieved ILECs from the requirement to unbundle two-wire and four-wire analog voice-grade copper loops, as well as from the obligation to offer a wholesale discount on its telecommunications services sold to competitive entrants for resale. While the obligation to offer telecommunications services for resale remains in effect (as it does for all local exchange carriers, incumbent and competitive entrants alike), we will no longer be obligated to offer any particular wholesale discount on those services. Both of those 2019 grants of forbearance are subject to a two-part transition period. First, for a six-month period that began on August 2, 2019, we were required to continue to accept new orders for analog voice-grade copper loops and discounted wholesale services, in accordance with the previous rules. Second, we must continue to honor existing arrangements, including those put in place during that initial six-month period, for a three-year period that also began on August 2, 2019, in order to permit customers sufficient time to undertake a transition to alternative arrangements.
 
Interstate Access Charges 
 
The FCC regulates the prices that ILECs charge for the use of their local telephone facilities in originating or terminating interstate calls.
 
Special Access Pricing Flexibility and Business Data Services
 
Rates for interstate telecommunications services offered by our ILEC subsidiaries are determined using price cap regulation, under which the rates vary from year to year based on mathematical formulae, and not based on changes to our costs, including both inter-carrier rates and retail end user rates.
 
On April 20, 2017, the FCC adopted an Order updating its regulations governing “business data services,” which are those circuit-switched or packet-switched services that offer dedicated point-to-point transmission of data at certain guaranteed speeds and service levels using high-capacity connections, including special access services. The FCC left in place the Phase I and Phase II pricing flexibility it granted to us in 2010 and granted further price deregulation of all business data services with transmission speeds above 45 Megabits per second. For legacy circuit-switched business data services with speeds at or below that level (DS-3 or below), the FCC adopted a new competitive market test, finding that price regulation is no longer required in counties (or county-equivalents, such as Alaskan boroughs) where the test is satisfied. We expect this FCC Order to support the Company’s ability to be market competitive for its business data services in many of our most competitive markets.
 
On August 28, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated portions of the FCC’s decision that ended prior regulation and tariffing of prices of legacy circuit-switched transport services offered by price cap carriers, like Alaska Communications, because it found that the FCC had not provided sufficient advance notice of that aspect of its decision. On July 12, 2019, following additional proceedings, the FCC re-adopted the majority of the forbearance relief that the Eighth Circuit had vacated, while leaving rate regulation in place on certain routes that the FCC believed to lack sufficient competition.
 
Transformation Order
 
A 2011 FCC order (the “Transformation Order”), capped our ILEC interstate and intrastate switched access rates and reciprocal compensation rates (“ICC rates”), and initiated a six-year transition of our terminating switched access and reciprocal compensation rates to zero, under a “bill-and-keep” model, in pursuit of the FCC’s goal that carriers will recover their costs from their end-users and, in some cases, universal service support mechanisms. That transition was complete as of July 1, 2018.
Federal Universal Service Support
 
The Communications Act requires the FCC to establish a universal service program to ensure that affordable, quality telecommunications services are available to all Americans. The Company has received universal support in several forms: (i) high cost support for its wireline voice and broadband Internet access service business under the Connect America Fund; (ii) support for services that the Company provides to schools and libraries, provided through the federal schools and libraries universal service support mechanism (“E-Rate”); (iii) support from the federal Rural Health Care support mechanism, which supports communications services that enable telehealth and telemedicine services provided by eligible rural health care providers; and (iv) low income support under the FCC’s Lifeline program, which subsidizes telephone and broadband Internet access services for low-income consumers. These programs are administered under the direction of the FCC by the Universal Service Administrative Company (“USAC”).

USF Contributions
 
Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”) and FCC rules, telecommunications carriers and certain providers of telecommunications must contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund, which is the source of funding for the four support mechanisms described above. These contributions are based on end-user revenues from assessable interstate and international services. For the first calendar quarter of 2021, we are required to pay an amount equal to 31.8 percent of our interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenue towards the federal Universal Service Fund. That contribution rate changes every calendar quarter, and has increased sharply in recent years, both because of increases in demand for universal service support payments, and because the assessable revenue base has shrunk considerably over the past two decades. In the long term, the current contribution mechanism is likely to be unsustainable, and collapse of the Universal Service Fund would have a significant impact throughout our industry.
 
Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Program
 
The FCC’s Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Mechanism (the “RHC program”) provides funding to help make broadband telecommunications and Internet access services provided by the Company and other service providers affordable for eligible rural health care providers. It is comprised of two parts. The Telecommunications Program covers the difference between the “urban rate” for telecommunications services that rural healthcare providers use to deliver healthcare at rural locations, and the “rural rate” that they would otherwise be required to pay. The Healthcare Connect Fund covers 65 percent of the cost of a wider variety of broadband telecommunications, networking, and Internet access services and certain associated equipment. Rural Health Care revenues represented 5.3% of the Company’s consolidated revenue in 2020.
 
The Company has participated in the RHC program since 2008. For the 2017 Funding Year, the FCC approved rural rates that were significantly reduced from the rates proposed by the Company. For Funding Years 2018, 2019, and 2020, we have likewise obtained FCC approval for our rural rates, generally at levels consistent with the reduced rates approved by the FCC for Funding Year 2017. The multi-step process of obtaining FCC approval for rates and then subsequently obtaining funding commitment letters from USAC has introduced varying degrees of delay in the process of obtaining support for the services we deliver to rural health care providers. Most recently, we received FCC approval for our Funding Year 2020 rates in January 2021, more than halfway through the funding year to which those rates relate (July 1, 2020 – June 30, 2021). USAC began issuing funding commitment letters in March 2021 and we are working with our healthcare provider customers to prepare and submit additional forms and documentation required to receive payment.
 
On March 27, 2020, the President signed into law the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act,” which, among other things, appropriates $200 million for the FCC to help health care providers provide connected care services to patients at their homes or mobile locations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the ensuing three months, the FCC used these funds to create the “COVID-19 Telehealth Program,” and made over 500 awards, comprising the entire sum, to health care providers in the lower 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, but none to health care providers in Alaska. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020, appropriated a further $250 million for the COVID-19 Telehealth Program, and directed that, to the extent feasible, at least one applicant in every state should receive an award of funding under the program.
 
The same FCC Report and Order also created the “Connected Care Pilot Program,” which makes an additional $100 million in universal service funding available over three years to study how the FCC can help support the trend towards connected care services, particularly for low-income Americans and veterans. The Connected Care Pilot Program will provide healthcare providers support for 85 percent of the cost of eligible services and network equipment, which include: (1) patient broadband internet access services, (2) health care provider broadband data connections, (3) other connected care information services, and (4) certain network equipment (e.g., equipment necessary to make a supported broadband service function such as routers). The FCC accepted applications for Connected Care Pilot Program support between November 6 and December 7, 2020. On January 15, 2021, the FCC announced its initial set of awards to healthcare providers in 12 states, but none in Alaska. While it is too soon to assess the ultimate impact, if any, of the Connected Care Pilot Program on our business, programs of this type that make the telehealth and telemedicine services more affordable could stimulate greater demand for those services in Alaska.

On August 1, 2019, the FCC adopted an order making comprehensive changes to the rules governing the competitive bidding process and the method for determining the urban and rural rates used to calculate the amount of RHC Telecommunications Program support payments for which a health care provider is eligible. The changes to the urban and rural rate rules take effect for Funding Year 2021, which will begin July 1, 2021, and rural healthcare providers were permitted to solicit bids for services to be supported in Funding Year 2021 beginning on July 1, 2020. Among other things, the FCC’s Order directed USAC to develop and publish a database by July 1, 2020, containing available rural rates and rate medians that will cap the amount of RHC support eligible healthcare providers may receive for a given service in a particular geographic zone. The FCC’s Order divided Alaska into four geographic zones, with the rural rate in each zone capped at the median of the rural rates for similar services offered in that zone, as identified by USAC. USAC published that rate database on July 1, 2020, following receipt of a June 30, 2020 letter providing significant guidance and directives from the FCC’s Wireline Competition Bureau (the “Bureau”). Among those directions, the Bureau directed USAC to provide an additional two months, until August 31, 2020, for interested parties to supplement the database with additional relevant rates. USAC announced on October 1, 2020 that it had incorporated those additional rates into the database.
 
On October 21, 2019, an appeal challenging the new method of setting rates for supported services was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, adding further uncertainty to the ultimate outcome of this proceeding. Similarly, the Company and several other parties have filed Petitions for Reconsideration of the FCC’s August 2019 Report and Order, asking the FCC to reconsider some of its changes to the rural healthcare rate-setting process. Among other changes, we asked the FCC to give the Bureau instead of USAC responsibility for creating the database; to provide more detailed guidance directing the Bureau to differentiate among broadband services based on additional service level, security, reliability, and other factors when creating the rural rate database; to make the rate database applicable only in cases where the rural health care provider received fewer than two competitive bids; and to set the rural rate cap, where applicable, based on the average rate, not the median, in the database. Both the action in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Petitions for Reconsideration filed with the FCC remain pending.
 
We believe that USAC’s rural rate database, as currently constituted, is likely to have an adverse impact on our economic ability to continue to serve some of our rural healthcare customers. In particular, the rates established by the database would negatively impact our ability to continue to offer our full range of telecommunications services to rural healthcare providers supported by the Telecommunications Program in the more remote, higher-cost areas of the state. We have requested that the full FCC review USAC’s effort and associated guidance from the Bureau concerning the database, delay the effectiveness of the new rural rates, and direct the Bureau to implement the changes we requested in our Petition for Reconsideration. On January 19, 2021, the FCC issued an order waiving the use of the database in Alaska for Funding Year 2021. The Order grants a similar waiver for Funding Year 2022, unless the Commission addresses the pending Petitions for Reconsideration within the coming year, i.e., by January 19, 2022. In lieu of the database, while the waiver remains in effect, the Order authorizes support based on the most recent rural rate that the FCC has approved for the same service at the same healthcare facility within the past three funding years. As an alternative, Telecommunications Program rural rates may be established under the previously applicable rate rules that were in effect through Funding Year 2020. As with the action in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Petitions for Reconsideration, the other issues raised in our Application for Review remain pending.
 
We are unable to predict the outcome or eventual impact of the D.C. Circuit’s review of the FCC’s Order, or the FCC’s decision on our Petition for Reconsideration or our Application for Review, but the January 2021 waiver offers a measure of short-term stability for the Telecommunications Program while those reviews continue.

USAC Audit of RHC Program Funding Requests
 
In addition to the prospective changes to the RHC program discussed above, the FCC and USAC have undertaken reviews of current and past funding requests. In June 2017, the Company received a letter from USAC’s auditors inquiring about past funding requests, all of which were previously approved by USAC. After clarifying the request, the Company responded to the auditors with the requested information through the remainder of 2017 and mid-way into 2018. Late in 2018, the auditors asked the Company to comment on some preliminary audit findings, and the Company responded with a letter dated December 21, 2018. After more than a year without further communication from the auditors, on February 24, 2020, the Company received a draft audit report from USAC that is described more fully in Note 21 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The draft audit report alleges violations of the FCC’s rules for establishing rural rates and urban rates, the provisioning and billing of ineligible services and products, and violations of the FCC’s competitive bidding rules. The Company was invited to comment on this draft audit report and, as of September 1, 2020, we have provided USAC with extensive comments in response. Our comments seek correction of numerous factual and legal errors that we believe are contained in that report. In addition, the Company has had conversations with USAC’s auditors to discuss these perceived errors. As a result of these conversations and comments being submitted by the Company, USAC’s auditors may revise their findings, including the amounts they recommend USAC seek to recover. USAC’s auditors are expected to issue a final audit report incorporating the Company’s responses that will be sent to USAC’s Rural Health Care Division to review and determine if corrective action would be appropriate. In the event that the Company disagrees with USAC’s final audit report, the Company can appeal that decision to USAC’s Rural Health Care Division and/or the FCC. At this time, we cannot predict the contents or timing of the final USAC audit report, the outcome of the audit or the impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
 
FCC Inquiry into Company’s RHC Program Participation
 
The Company also received a Letter of Inquiry on March 18, 2018, from the FCC Enforcement Bureau requesting historical information regarding the Company’s participation in the FCC’s Rural Health Care program. In response, the Company produced voluminous records throughout 2018 and into the first quarter of 2019. On November 5, 2019, the Company received another letter from the FCC Enforcement Bureau requesting additional information, to which it responded on December 6, 2019. The Company is currently responding to an additional letter from the Enforcement Bureau dated January 22, 2020. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has not asserted any claims or alleged any rule violations. The Company continues to work constructively with the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau to provide it the information it is seeking. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the FCC Enforcement Bureau’s inquiry or the impact it may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
 
Connect America Fund
 
The Transformation Order also replaced the FCC’s previous set of explicit high-cost universal service support mechanisms for price cap carriers, like Alaska Communications, with the Connect America Fund (“CAF”). While the previous mechanisms were focused on supporting a portion of the cost of providing voice telephone service, the CAF shifted that focus to expanding the availability of affordable broadband services. On October 31, 2016, the FCC released its order establishing the requirements of CAF Phase II (“CAF II”) for price cap carriers in Alaska, and specifically Alaska Communications, the only price cap carrier in Alaska. Under the CAF II order, we receive approximately $19.7 million annually through December 31, 2025, subject to explicit broadband deployment conditions.
 
We are continuing to work toward meeting our CAF Phase II obligations in a capital-efficient manner, including the delivery of broadband Internet access services meeting CAF Phase II requirements using a fixed wireless platform and DSL in some instances. On July 21, 2020, we announced that we now offer voice and broadband service meeting our CAF Phase II commitments to over 16,000 rural Alaskans. The Company is therefore more than half way to the total number required by December 31, 2025 under CAF Phase II.
 
Call Authentication
 
On December 30, 2019, Congress enacted the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act. Among other things, the TRACED Act seeks to reduce the number of unwanted calls (“robocalls”) in which the calling party deceive the recipient by falsifying the Caller ID information to make it appear that the call is from someone the recipient knows or can trust. To do so, the TRACED Act directs the FCC to require all voice service providers to implement “STIR/SHAKEN” standards developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) for authenticating and verifying caller ID information for calls carried in the IP portions of their networks, and implement an effective caller ID authentication framework in the non-IP portions of their networks. The law requires service providers to take these steps no later than 18 months from enactment.
 
    17 

  

On March 31, 2020, the FCC issued a Report and Order implementing this law by mandating that all voice service providers implement the STIR/SHAKEN framework in the Internet Protocol (IP) portions of their networks by June 30, 2021. In a related Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FCC sought comment on additional issues, including a potential extension of time for small providers that serve 100,000 or fewer voice service subscriber lines, which would include us. On October 1, 2020, the FCC released an Order granting small providers, as proposed, an extension of time to implement STIR/SHAKEN until June 30, 2023.
 
The FCC’s March 31, 2020 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking also sought comment on proposals for implementing the law with respect to “intermediate” providers of voice service, which, with respect to a call, is a provider that carries that call at any point, but neither originates nor terminates it. The FCC’s October 1, 2020 Order requires us, by June 30, 2021, in our role as an intermediate provider, to implement the STIR/SHAKEN authentication framework in the IP portions of our network, in general so that IP calls retain caller ID authentication information throughout the entire call path. Specifically, with certain exceptions, we must be able to (a) pass any authenticated caller identification information received with a SIP call, to the subsequent provider; and (b) authenticate caller identification information for all calls we receive for which the caller identification information has not already been authenticated, if we will exchange the call with another provider using SIP. We are currently in the process of implementing these requirements.
 
On July 17, 2020, the FCC released a further Report and Order concerning the blocking of illegal and unwanted robocalls before they reach consumers. To encourage the blocking of scam robocalls and maliciously spoofed telemarketing campaigns under the TRACED Act, the FCC adopted two safe harbors from liability for the unintended or inadvertent blocking of wanted calls. The first safe harbor protects phone companies from liability that use reasonable analytics, including caller ID authentication information, to identify and block illegal or unwanted calls. The second safe harbor protects providers that block call traffic from bad actor upstream voice service providers that pass illegal or unwanted calls along to other providers, when those upstream providers have been notified but fail to take action to stop these calls. The FCC has announced that these rules took effect on October 14, 2020.
 
Network Equipment
 
On March 12, 2020, the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019 was signed into law, prohibiting the use of federal universal service funds to obtain communications equipment or services from a company that poses a national security risk to U.S. communications networks. In addition, under the law, each communications provider must submit an annual report to the FCC regarding whether it has purchased, rented, leased, or otherwise obtained any prohibited equipment and, if so, provide a detailed justification for such action. Previously, in November 2019, the FCC preliminarily designated Huawei and ZTE as companies that pose such risks. Currently, Alaska Communications believes that little or no equipment from those manufacturers is present in our network. On July 16, 2020, the FCC adopted a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on additional questions concerning the implementation of that Act.
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline
 
On July 16, 2020, the FCC adopted a Report and Order designating the three-digit code “988” as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and directed all service providers to enable use of that code to reach suicide prevention and crisis intervention services no later than July 16, 2022. There are 87 area codes across the country, including the “907” area code used throughout Alaska, where local calls may be dialed using seven digits, and where “988” is used as a three-digit telephone exchange prefix. To ensure that calls are not erroneously routed to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline when a user intends to dial a seven-digit call starting with “988,” the FCC required all 87 of the affected area codes to transition to ten-digit dialing for all calls during the transition period. As a result of these changes, Alaska Communications will need to upgrade and reprogram its switches throughout the state, and assist with consumer education efforts with respect to these new dialing patterns. We are unable to predict with certainty that it will be possible to implement all of the necessary changes within the time required, or the effect of these changes on our business expenses and results.

Lifeline
 
Revenue generated from our lifeline customers represents less than 1% of our total revenue. The FCC’s Lifeline support mechanism today subsidizes the cost of voice services for low-income consumers, as well as broadband in CAF II locations.
 
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 appropriated $3.2 billion to create the “Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund,” and directed the FCC to use that fund to establish a new “Emergency Broadband Benefit Program” (“EBBP”). The EBBP will provide eligible low-income consumers and students with a monthly subsidy for the purchase of broadband Internet access service from service providers that elect to participate in the program. While the monthly subsidy is $50 in most of the nation, the EBBP will provide $75 monthly throughout the state of Alaska, which is encompassed within the statute’s definition of “Tribal lands.” On Jan. 4, 2021, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on various implementation questions related to the EBBP, including the process by which service providers will formally elect to participate in the program and designate the broadband offerings that are eligible for the subsidy. While we cannot predict with certainty until after the FCC adopts final rules for the EBBP, we are carefully examining the benefits this new program may offer for Alaska.
 
E-Rate
 
The Company has provided telecommunications services, broadband Internet access services, and internal connections supported by the FCC’s Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support Mechanism (“E-rate”) for many years. E-rate support provides an invaluable means by which elementary and secondary schools in Alaska can afford those services, particularly in rural and remote, high-cost areas. Historically, E-rate has primarily supported services that connect eligible school buildings. On January 26, 2021, the Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband (“SHLB”) Coalition filed a Petition seeking a declaratory ruling and associated rule waivers to permit schools and libraries temporarily to receive E-rate support for “off-campus” services used to support remote learning for students that lack reliable home broadband. If the FCC were to grant the relief that the Petition seeks, it could increase demand for our home broadband services, but also could increase the administrative burden and compliance risks associated with those services. We are unable to predict the impact of this Petition, if any, at this time.
 
Satellite Services
 
On February 16, 2018, the FCC granted our application for a license to operate a network of C-band satellite earth stations to be used to serve our customers that cannot be reached by terrestrial middle mile facilities. Under that license, we are authorized to use C-band spectrum on Eutelsat’s satellite, E115WB, for a term of 15 years. We have steadily expanded this network to serve over 40 sites, primarily in rural and remote areas of the state. We expect this approach to provide us with greater predictability and stability in the availability and cost of long-haul transport connectivity to our customers that must be served by satellite.
 
On March 3, 2020, the FCC released a Report and Order clearing the lower portion of that band (3.7-4.0 GHz) of virtually all satellite services in the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia. The Report and Order allows continued use of that spectrum for satellite services in other areas of the nation, including Alaska, essentially preserving the status quo. As a result, the FCC’s decision has little to no effect on our authority to continue to offer C-band satellite communications services to our Alaska customers.
 
Acquisition by ATN International, Inc.
 
On January 20, 2021, we filed a series of applications seeking FCC approval for the transfer of control of our licenses and authorizations to ATN International, Inc. We have discussed those applications with the FCC staff, and, on February 16, 2021, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking public comment on the proposed transaction.

State Regulation
 
Providers of intrastate telecommunication services in Alaska are required to obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity from the RCA. In addition, RCA approval is required if an entity acquires a controlling interest in any of our certificated subsidiaries, acquires a controlling interest in another intrastate utility or discontinues intrastate service. On August 29, 2019, Governor Dunleavy signed into law new legislation that eliminated the requirement for Alaska Communications to maintain RCA-filed tariffs for rates, terms, and conditions for legacy phone and networking services in Alaska, However, rates, terms, and conditions for basic residential local telephone service must, under the bill, be uniform within each study area. Alaska Communications implemented changes to tariffs, terms and conditions and other service related policies effective November 27, 2019.
Alaska Universal Service Fund 
 
The Alaska Universal Service Fund (“AUSF”) complements the federal Universal Service Fund, but is focused on obligations to meet intrastate service obligations.
 
In January 2018, the RCA opened a rulemaking to repeal the AUSF effective July 31, 2019 and sought comments and reply comments. A final order issued by the RCA on October 24, 2018 stopped short of repealing the AUSF but made changes to the distribution to be effective January 1, 2019, and capped contributions at 10% of intrastate telecommunications revenues. These changes resulted in shortfalls to carriers beginning in 2019. The RCA has announced its intent to open a new docket to consider further AUSF reforms in June 2021.
Telecommunications Modernization Act
 
In late December 2019, the RCA opened R-19-002 to consider the Alaska Telephone Associations Petition to revise the RCA’s regulation as a result of SB 83 or the Telecommunications Modernization Act. The comment and reply comment period ended February 3, 2020. The RCA continues to consider this matter.
AC Systems Group and ATN International, Inc. Joint Application
 
The RCA opened Docket U-21-003 to consider the joint application filed by ATN International, Inc. and Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. for ATN International, Inc. to acquire an indirect controlling interest in the ACS of Alaska, LLC, ACS of Anchorage, LLC, ACS of Fairbanks, LLC, ACS of the Northland, LLC, ACS Long Distance, LLC, and Alaska Fiber Star, LLC.  The RCA issued a public notice seeking comments on the application and has established a schedule for completing its review of the application by July 2021.
