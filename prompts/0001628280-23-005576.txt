BUSINESS
Company Overview
Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. is a commercial-stage oncology company developing novel therapeutics to address the genetic and immunological promoters of cancer. 
We have multiple KRAS inhibitor programs. KRAZATI is our first commercial product. KRAZATI was approved by the FDA in December 2022 and we commenced commercial sales in the U.S. at that time. KRAZATI is an oral targeted treatment option for adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. Adagrasib (KRAZATI™) is in clinical development as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents. MRTX1133 is an investigational, selective, specific and potent KRAS G12D inhibitor. In January 2023, the FDA cleared our investigational new drug application (“IND”) for MRTX1133 for clinical evaluation.
Sitravatinib is an investigational spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor designed to potently inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases (“RTK”s) and enhance immune responses through the inhibition of immunosuppressive signaling and is in clinical development. 
MRTX1719 is an investigational synthetic lethal PRMT5 inhibitor designed to specifically target the PRMT5/methylthioadensoine (MTA) complex and is in clinical development.
MRTX0902 is a potent, selective SOS1 inhibitor, designed to improve anti-tumor efficacy in combination with targeted mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-pathway inhibitors, and is in clinical development. 
The Company also has additional discovery programs of potentially first-in-class and best-in-class product candidates specifically designed to address mutations and tumors where few treatment options exist. We approach all of our programs with a singular focus: to translate our deep understanding of the molecular drivers of cancer into better therapies and better outcomes for patients.
KRAS Inhibitor Programs 

The RAS family of genes is the most commonly mutated oncogene and mutations in this gene family occur in up to approximately 25% of all human cancers. Among the RAS family members, mutations most frequently occur in KRAS (approximately 85% of all RAS family mutations). Tumors characterized by KRAS mutations are commonly associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that cancer cells exhibiting KRAS mutations are highly dependent on KRAS function for cell growth and survival. Our KRAS inhibitor programs are focused on the discovery and development of small molecule compounds that target various forms of KRAS, including KRAS G12C, KRAS G12D and other forms of spectrum-selective KRAS inhibitors. We are pursuing development of our KRAS G12C and KRAS G12D inhibitor programs in both single agent and rational combination approaches.

KRAZATI, a selective KRAS G12C inhibitor

KRAZATI is a commercially available, selective, specific, potent and orally available KRAS G12C inhibitor, designed to directly inhibit KRAS G12C mutations. Adagrasib also continues to be in clinical development varying from Phase 1 through Phase 3. KRAS G12C mutations are present in approximately 14% of NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients, 3-4% of colorectal cancer (“CRC”) patients, 2% of pancreatic cancer patients, as well as smaller percentages of several other difficult-to-treat cancers. 
Approval of KRAZATI
On December 12, 2022, we announced the FDA completed its review of our New Drug Application (“NDA”) and granted accelerated approval for KRAZATI, a targeted treatment option for adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. In connection with the accelerated approval, we are required to complete KRYSTAL-12 and other post-marketing commitments. The NDA was reviewed by the FDA for Accelerated Approval (Subpart H), which allows for the approval of drugs that treat serious conditions, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. In addition, this application was reviewed under the FDA Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program, which aims to explore a more efficient 
review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible, and achieved Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients with NSCLC who harbor the KRAS G12C mutation following prior systemic therapy, and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients with advanced CRC whose cancer has progressed following prior treatment with chemotherapy and an anti-VEGF therapy. In April 2022, we submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for adagrasib for the treatment of patients with NSCLC harboring the KRAS G12C mutation who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. The Company also has an Expanded Access Program for KRAZATI for the treatment of eligible patients with KRAS G12C-mutated cancers regardless of tumor type in the United States and Europe. 
KRYSTAL-1 Trial
We received FDA clearance of our IND for adagrasib in November 2018, and, in January 2019, we initiated the dose escalation phase of KRYSTAL-1, a Phase 1/2 multiple expansion cohort clinical trial evaluating adagrasib in patients with advanced solid tumors that harbor KRAS G12C mutations both in monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer therapies. Following single agent dose escalation, the KRYSTAL-1 trial was expanded into multiple cohorts in which adagrasib is being evaluated both in monotherapy and in combination with other compounds in patients with NSCLC, CRC and those with other tumors that carry the KRAS G12C mutation.
The KRYSTAL-1 trial is evaluating the combination of adagrasib and a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in patients with NSCLC, the combination of adagrasib and a pan-EGFR inhibitor (afatinib) in patients with advanced NSCLC, and the combination of adagrasib and an anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) in patients with CRC. 
On September 7, 2022, we presented results from KRYSTAL-1, a multi-cohort Phase 1/2 study, evaluating adagrasib with or without cetuximab in patients with advanced CRC harboring a KRASG12C mutation.
•In this analysis, 44 patients received adagrasib monotherapy (600mg twice daily (“BID”)) and 32 patients received the combination of adagrasib (600mg BID) with full dose cetuximab, with a follow up of 20.1 months and 17.5 months, respectively.
•Of the evaluable patients in the adagrasib monotherapy cohort (n=43), the investigator assessed confirmed objective response rate (“ORR”) was 19% (8/43) and the disease control rate (“DCR”) was 86% (37/43). The median duration of response was 4.3 months (95% CI, 2.3–8.3) and median progression-free survival (“PFS”) was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1–8.3).
•Of the evaluable patients in the adagrasib plus cetuximab combination cohort (n=28), the investigator assessed confirmed ORR was 46% (13/28) and the DCR was 100% (28/28). The median duration of response (“DOR”) was 7.6 months (95% CI 5.7–NE) and median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.4–8.1).
•In the overall subset of patients with KRAS G12C-mutated CRC evaluated in this study, adagrasib was found to be well-tolerated as a monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab. The majority of observed treatment-related adverse events (“TRAEs”) were grade 1–2 (59%); no grade 5 TRAEs were observed.
On May 26, 2022, we presented results from the registration-enabling Phase 2 cohort of KRYSTAL-1 study, evaluating adagrasib at 600mg BID in patients with NSCLC harboring the KRAS G12C mutation who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.
•As of October 15, 2021, 116 patients were enrolled and treated in the study. Of the patients enrolled, 98% had prior treatment with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor following or in combination with chemotherapy. Median follow up was 12.9 months.
•Of the patients evaluable for response (n=112), initial results showed that the ORR by Blinded Independent Central Review (“BICR”) was 43%, the DCR was 80%, the median DOR was 8.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.2 – 13.8), and the median PFS was 6.5 months (95% CI: 4.7 – 8.4).
•With a January 15, 2022 data cutoff, the median overall survival (“OS”) was 12.6 months (95% CI: 9.2 – 19.2).
•The safety profile of adagrasib in this study was consistent with prior reports and no new safety signals were observed. The most frequent TRAEs included gastrointestinal events and fatigue. The majority of TRAEs were Grade 1–2 (53%) 
with Grade 3–4 TRAEs observed in 43% of patients. Two Grade 5 TRAEs were observed. TRAEs led to discontinuation of therapy in only 7% of patients.
In addition to these results, we reported findings from a pooled analysis in a total of 132 NSCLC patients from the KRYSTAL-1 study, including the registrational Phase 2 and Phase 1/1b cohorts evaluating adagrasib at a dose of 600mg BID.
•As of October 15, 2021, results from this pooled analysis showed an ORR of 44% and a DCR of 81% based on BICR. The median DOR was 12.5 months and the median PFS was 6.9 months.
•With a January 15, 2022 data cutoff and a median duration of follow-up of 15.9 months, the median OS was 14.1 months. 
•The safety and tolerability observed in this pooled analysis was consistent with what was reported with the Phase 2 cohort of KRYSTAL-1 noted above.
On June 6, 2022, we announced results of a prospective analysis from the Phase 1b cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 study evaluating intracranial (IC) responses of adagrasib in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC with active and untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. With a median follow up of 6.6 months, 25 patients with active, untreated CNS metastases were enrolled in the study and treated with adagrasib 600mg BID, as of data cutoff date of December 2021. Of the radiographically evaluable patients (n=19), results showed an IC ORR of 32% by modified response assessment in neuro-oncology-brain metastases (modified RANO-BM) by BICR. Three patients achieved a complete response and three patients achieved a partial response. The IC disease control rate was 84%, and concordance of disease control between systemic and IC responses was 88%.
On June 6, 2022, we also provided updated results from the Phase 1b cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 trial evaluating the combination of adagrasib and a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in eight patients with KRAS G12C-mutated first-line NSCLC. The Phase 1b data showed adagrasib 400mg BID plus pembrolizumab had a manageable tolerability profile with no TRAEs leading to dose discontinuation. Of the seven patients evaluable for a response as of January 15, 2022, four had a confirmed RECIST-defined partial response and one additional patient, who is still on study, experienced 49% tumor regression in the first scan, which allowed for tumor resection prior to achieving a RECIST-defined confirmed response. The DCR was 100%, with all seven patients exhibiting tumor regression ranging from 37% to 81%. With a median duration of treatment of 12.9 months, four of the seven patients remained on treatment, as of the data cutoff date, and neither the median DOR nor median PFS had been reached.
On October 9, 2021, we presented preliminary results from a cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 clinical trial evaluating adagrasib at 600mg BID as monotherapy for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma harboring a KRAS G12C mutation arm (n=12). Of the evaluable patients (n=10), preliminary results showed an investigator assessed ORR of 50%, including an unconfirmed PR, and a DCR of 100%.
Preliminary efficacy data was assessed as of August 30, 2020 in six patients with advanced solid tumors, other than NSCLC and CRC, treated with adagrasib as a monotherapy at 600mg BID dose from a Phase 1/1b cohort. One patient each with pancreatic, ovarian, endometrial and cholangiocarcinoma tumors were treated and had a confirmed PR to therapy. Two appendiceal cancer patients had stable disease and all six eligible patients remained on treatment.
KRYSTAL-7
In December 2020, we initiated KRYSTAL-7, the Phase 2 clinical trial includes the evaluation of the combination of adagrasib at 400mg BID with a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in patients with first-line NSCLC stratified by <1% Tumor Proportion Score (“TPS”) score and ≥1% TPS score.
On December 7, 2022, we presented preliminary results from the KRYSTAL-7 Phase 2 trial and KRYSTAL-1 Phase 1b cohort evaluating adagrasib (400mg twice daily) concurrently combined with pembrolizumab in patients for the treatment of first-line NSCLC harboring a KRASG12C mutation across all PD-L1 subgroups.
•Adagrasib in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrates favorable tolerability and promising preliminary efficacy in patients with first-line advanced/metastatic NSCLC harboring a KRAS G12C mutation.
•The KRYSTAL-7 and KRYSTAL-1 trials represent the largest dataset evaluating a KRAS G12C inhibitor in combination with a PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitor as a first-line treatment for patients with NSCLC harboring a KRASG12C mutation.
•75 patients were enrolled and evaluable for safety with a median follow-up of 3.5 months (duration of treatment: two months). TRAEs were Grade 1-2 (39%), Grade 3 (40%) and Grade 4 (4%); there were no Grade 5 TRAEs observed. TRAEs led to discontinuation of both adagrasib and pembrolizumab in two patients and only pembrolizumab in two patients; there were no patients who discontinued only adagrasib due to a TRAE.
•Increases in alanine transaminase (“ALT”)/aspartate transaminase (“AST”) were consistent with either agent as a monotherapy with Grade 3 TRAEs being highest grade and total incidence of Grade 3 liver function test (“LFT”) increases of 9%. Median time from onset to an increase in ALT and AST was 26 and 37 days, respectively, and only one patient experienced new onset treatment-related ALT/AST increase after 3 months.
•Of patients who were clinically evaluable and received at least one on-study scan (n=53), adagrasib and pembrolizumab demonstrated promising preliminary clinical activity across all PD-L1 subgroups with an ORR of 49%.
•In a subset of response-evaluable patients enrolled at least six months prior to the data cutoff date, six of 26 clinical responses occurred at second on-study scan or later, and the ORR was 56%.
•Seven evaluable patients enrolled in the KRYSTAL-1 Phase 1b cohort (with a median follow-up of 19.3 months) reported an ORR of 57% and a DCR of 100%. The four patients who responded maintained response for over nine months while two continued to receive treatment and remain in response beyond 18 months.
•Safety in the KRYSTAL-1 Phase 1b cohort was consistent with what has been observed in KRYSTAL-7 and demonstrated a manageable safety profile with no Grade 4-5 TRAEs.
KRYSTAL-10, KRYSTAL-12, and KRYSTAL-17
In the first quarter of 2021, we initiated two registration-enabling Phase 3 clinical trials. The first clinical trial, KRYSTAL-12, is evaluating adagrasib as a monotherapy randomized against docetaxel in patients with second-line NSCLC. The second clinical trial, KRYSTAL-10, is evaluating the combination of adagrasib and an anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) randomized against chemotherapy in patients with second-line CRC. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated KRYSTAL-17, a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating adagrasib in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. 
Adagrasib Development in Collaboration with Zai Lab Ltd. (“Zai”)
In May 2021, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Zai (the “Zai Agreement”). Under the Zai Agreement, we granted Zai the right to research, develop, manufacture and exclusively commercialize adagrasib in all indications in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan (collectively, the “Zai Licensed Territory”), with Mirati retaining exclusive rights for the development, manufacture and commercialization of adagrasib outside the Zai Territory and certain co-commercialization, manufacture, and development rights in the Zai Licensed Territory. In June 2022, Zai initiated the first pivotal clinical trial of adagrasib for the first indication in China. In July 2022, Zai initiated the first pivotal clinical trial of adagrasib for the second indication in China.
Adagrasib Development in Collaboration with Others
In 2020, we initiated KRYSTAL-2, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of adagrasib and a SHP-2 inhibitor (TNO-155) in patients with advanced NSCLC and advanced CRC. In 2021, we initiated KRYSTAL-14, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of adagrasib and a SOS1 inhibitor (BI 1701963) in patients with advanced NSCLC, and we initiated KRYSTAL-16, a Phase 1/1b clinical trial evaluating the combination of adagrasib and a CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib) in patients with advanced solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutation. The KRYSTAL-2, KRYSTAL-14 and KRYSTAL-16 clinical trials are no longer enrolling patients. In October 2022, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Aadi Bioscience to evaluate the combination of adagrasib with nab-sirolimus, a small molecule mTOR inhibitor complexed with human albumin, in patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC and other solid tumors. In November 2022, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Incyte to evaluate the combination of adagrasib with INCB99280, a small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor, in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated solid tumors. 
MRTX1133, a selective KRAS G12D inhibitor
MRTX1133, our lead KRAS G12D compound, is an investigational, selective, specific and potent inhibitor of KRAS G12D. On January 19, 2023, the FDA cleared the IND application of an oral formulation of MRTX1133 for clinical evaluation. KRAS G12D mutations have been detected in over 25 different types of cancer, including pancreatic, colon, lung and endometrial adenocarcinoma. The prevalence of cancers harboring KRAS G12D mutations exceeds the prevalence of KRAS G12C positive cancers by greater than two-fold and is an area of significant unmet medical need.
On October 25, 2020 we announced initial preclinical in vivo data from MRTX1133. Based on preclinical analyses, MRTX1133 has a projected human half-life of greater than 50 hours and exhibits a low propensity for drug interactions or off-target pharmacology. MRTX1133 demonstrated tumor regression in multiple in vivo tumor models, including pancreatic and colorectal cancers. MRTX1133 has a low predicted target plasma concentration based on its potency and high unbound fraction. 

Sitravatinib
Sitravatinib is a spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical development and is designed to potently inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases (“RTK”s), including TAM family receptors (TYRO3, Axl, Mer), split family receptors (VEGFR2, KIT) and RET. Sitravatinib’s potent inhibition of TAM and split family RTKs may overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy through targeted reversal of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, enhancing antigen-specific T cell response and expanding dendritic cell-dependent antigen presentation. There are over 100,000 second or third line NSCLC patients in the United States and Europe, who have derived prior clinical benefit following treatment with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor, with approximately 70,000 of these patients being of the non-squamous histology.
Sitravatinib in Combination with Nivolumab
As an immuno-oncology agent, sitravatinib is being evaluated in combination with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with NSCLC who have experienced documented disease progression following treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. Sitravatinib is also being developed in certain Asian territories in collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd. (“BeiGene”) which is evaluating sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab, BeiGene’s anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, in a number of advanced solid tumors.
In January 2019, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company ("BMS") in connection with SAPPHIRE. Under the terms of the collaboration, we are sponsoring and funding the clinical trial and BMS is providing nivolumab at no cost. We maintain global development and commercial rights to sitravatinib outside of certain Asian territories and Australia and New Zealand, where we have partnered with BeiGene, and we are free to develop the program in combination with other agents.
In April 2022, we completed enrollment in SAPPHIRE, a Phase 3 clinical trial in second-line non-squamous NSCLC patients whose tumors have progressed on prior therapy with platinum-chemotherapy in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor or third-line non-squamous NSCLC patients who have received chemotherapy followed by a checkpoint inhibitor. SAPPHIRE is comparing the combination of sitravatinib plus nivolumab randomized to docetaxel. The statistical design of SAPPHIRE includes an interim analysis of overall survival.
On December 2, 2022, we announced, based on the results of the interim analysis on overall survival, SAPPHIRE will continue to final analysis.
We also have several Phase 2 clinical trials in which we are evaluating sitravatinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with NSCLC, who have experienced documented disease progression following prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or a checkpoint inhibitor. On September 20, 2021, we announced results from a post hoc exploratory analysis of the Phase 2 study, MRTX-500, in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC with prior clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy and where anti-PD-(L)1 was the most recent line of therapy (n=68) and a median follow-up of 33.6 months. The median overall survival was 14.9 months (95% CI: 9.3, 21.1), with 56% and 32% of these patients alive at one year and two years, respectively. The ORR was 18%, with 3% of patients achieving a complete response and 15% of patients achieving a PR. The median DOR was 12.8 months.
Sitravatinib Development in Collaboration with BeiGene
In January 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with BeiGene (the “BeiGene Agreement”). Under the BeiGene Agreement, we granted BeiGene an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sitravatinib in Asia (excluding Japan and certain other countries), Australia and New Zealand (the “BeiGene Licensed Territory”), and we retained exclusive rights for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of sitravatinib outside the BeiGene Licensed Territory.
In November 2018, we dosed the first patient under the BeiGene Agreement to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of sitravatinib in combination with BeiGene’s investigational anti-PD-1 antibody, tislelizumab, in patients with advanced solid tumors. BeiGene’s clinical trials will evaluate the combination of sitravatinib and tislelizumab in patients with solid tumors including NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular cancer, gastric cancer and ovarian cancer.
MRTX1719, a synthetic lethal MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor
MRTX1719, our lead synthetic lethal MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor is an investigational, selective, potent and orally available inhibitor targeting the PRMT5/MTA complex in methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted cancers and is in Phase 1/2 clinical development. The MTAP deletion is present in approximately 10% of all cancers and is the most frequently observed gene deletion event (MTAP/CDKN2A) across several cancer types. Cancers with an MTAP deletion, such as pancreatic, lung, and bladder cancers, are associated with a poor prognosis, representing a significant unmet medical need.
In preclinical studies, MRTX1719 has demonstrated a greater than 70-fold selectivity for MTAP-deleted cells relative to normal cells and demonstrated near complete and sustained inhibition of PRMT5 in tumor xenografts resulting in significant tumor growth inhibition or tumor regression in MTAP-deleted tumor models. The ability to target the PRMT5/MTA complex provides an opportunity to selectively target tumor cells harboring the MTAP gene deletion which exhibit an abnormally high level of MTA (methylthioadenosine) compared with normal cells. This is anticipated to provide an increased therapeutic index relative to first generation PRMT5 inhibitors that do not specifically target the PRMT5/MTA complex. In the first quarter of 2022, we initiated a Phase 1/2 multiple expansion cohort trial to evaluate MRTX1719 in patients with advanced, unresectable or metastatic solid tumor malignancy with homozygous deletion of the MTAP gene. In August 2022, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to MRTX1719.
MRTX0902, a selective SOS1 inhibitor
MRTX0902 is a potent, selective SOS1 inhibitor, designed to improve anti-tumor efficacy in combination with targeted RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (“MAPK”)-pathway and/or receptor tyrosine kinase (“RTK”) inhibitors. MRTX0902 disrupts the KRAS-SOS1 interaction and shifts the equilibrium of KRAS from an active to inactive state. The SOS protein is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (“GEF”) that facilitates the ability of KRAS to turnover from its GDP-loaded “off” state to its GTP-loaded “on” state, a critical step to enable productive KRAS effector binding and activation of downstream signaling. MRTX0902 has the potential to limit cancer growth arising from a variety of mutations (e.g. KRAS or EGFR) that result in activation of the KRAS pathway. MRTX0902 exhibits favorable potency, selectivity and oral exposure characteristics and shows improved anti-tumor efficacy in combination with inhibitors of KRAS, MEK, and EGFR in pre-clinical models. We filed an IND with the FDA for MRTX0902 and received Notice to Proceed authorization from FDA in August 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a Phase 1/2 multiple expansion cohort trial with MRTX0902. In December 2022, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to MRTX0902.
Market and Competition
NSCLC Market

The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2022, approximately 237,000 patients in the United States (“U.S.”) were diagnosed with lung cancer and 130,000 died due to the disease. Lung cancer represents approximately 12% of all new cancer cases in the U.S., and 21% of all cancer deaths. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 80-85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. The five-year survival rate for patients with NSCLC is 26%, indicating a significant need for novel therapies to extend overall survival in this patient population.

The prognosis for advanced NSCLC is poor, and the primary objective of treating late-stage disease is to prolong overall survival, delay disease progression and control symptoms. The treatment algorithm for advanced NSCLC has changed significantly following recent approvals and label expansions of immuno-oncology agents, specifically immune checkpoint 
inhibitors. In 2015, the FDA approved OPDIVO®, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and the first immuno-oncology agent approved for the treatment of squamous NSCLC. The approval of OPDIVO® in NSCLC was subsequently followed by FDA approval of three additional immuno-oncology agents in NSCLC, KEYTRUDA®, TECENTRIQ®, and IMFINZI®. These four agents, approved for multiple indications including NSCLC, accounted for over $31 billion in global sales in 2021.

Despite the advances in patient outcomes demonstrated by approved immuno-oncology therapies in NSCLC, a significant patient need remains. The percentage of patients who respond to approved immuno-oncology treatments is quite low, and of the patients that respond, the majority will still experience disease progression.

NSCLC represents a heterogeneous patient population with diverse tumor histology and underlying genomic aberrations. The clinical and commercial success of leading targeted agents across multiple indications, including NSCLC, demonstrates the potential of new targeted treatments for cancer. 
Competition
KRAS G12C

We are aware of other companies who currently have competing commercial or clinical-stage direct KRAS G12C inhibitor programs including Amgen, Inc., F. Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, and Revolution Medicines, Inc.
Sitravatinib in Combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors

There are several immune checkpoint inhibitors currently approved for use as single agents to treat multiple tumor types, including NSCLC. To augment the efficacy of these agents, combination studies are being conducted with a variety of potentially synergistic mechanisms, including inhibitors of CTLA-4, LAG3, TIM-3, TIGIT and CSF-1R, among others. Most of these combination studies are being conducted in patients who are naïve to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Other competitors to sitravatinib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients who had previously failed checkpoint inhibitor therapy include LENVIMA® (Eisai Co., Ltd.), an anti-VEGF agent that also inhibits other receptor tyrosine kinases, and datopotamab deruxtecan (AstraZeneca plc), a TROP2 antibody-drug conjugate. Additionally, there are numerous other potential competitors with kinase inhibitors that are being evaluated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients who had previously failed checkpoint inhibitor therapy in earlier lines of treatment.
PRMT5

We are aware of other companies who currently have competing clinical-stage MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor programs including Tango Therapeutics, Inc., and Amgen, Inc.
Oncology

In addition to companies that have kinase inhibitors addressing our targets of interest, our competition also includes hundreds of private and publicly traded companies that operate in the area of oncology but have therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. The oncology market in general is highly competitive with over 1,000 molecules currently in clinical development. Other important competitors, in addition to those mentioned above, are small and large biotechnology companies, specialty and regional pharmaceutical companies and multinational pharmaceutical companies, including but not limited to AbbVie Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., Sanofi S.A., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
Intellectual Property

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection wherever appropriate for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies both in the United States and in other countries. We typically file for patents in the United States with counterparts in certain countries in Europe and certain key market countries in the rest of the world, thereby covering the major pharmaceutical markets. As of December 31, 2022, we own or co-own U.S. patents and patent applications and their foreign counterparts, including thirty-one (31) issued U.S. patents covering adagrasib and other various KRAS inhibitors, including those for G12C and G12D, sitravatinib, and other compounds. Mirati’s patents and patent applications have expiration dates ranging from 2023-2044, with the adagrasib composition of matter patent expiring in 2037-2038. In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the 
country or jurisdiction that issued the patent. Trademark applications for adagrasib have been filed in major markets world-wide, with European registrations secured and U.S. registrations expected in the first half of 2023. 
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our products or product candidates, nor do we plan to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials and finished products for our preclinical and clinical trials.
Manufacturers of our products and product candidates are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented.

Our business activities, including the manufacturing of our product candidates and our ongoing research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Regulation by these government authorities is a significant component in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and services. Before marketing in the United States, any new drug developed must undergo rigorous preclinical testing, clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “FDCA”). The FDCA and other various federal, state and foreign statutes govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, quality, and import and export of our medicines. State, local, and other authorities also regulate pharmaceutical manufacturing. 
Applicable legislation requires licensing of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, and governmental review and/or approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic products. Additionally, adherence to good laboratory practices (“GLP”) and good clinical practices (“GCP”) during nonclinical and clinical testing and cGMP during production is required. Our manufacturing CMOs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other foreign equivalents to ensure that they are operating in compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, marketing authorization for each new medicine may require a rigorous manufacturing pre-approval inspection by regulatory authorities. Post approval, there are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and, depending on the significance of the change, changes may require prior FDA approval. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. 
In addition, we are subject to other state and federal laws, including, among others, anti-kickback laws, fraud and abuse, false claims laws, Sunshine Act, patient protection and affordable care, data privacy and security laws and regulations, and transparency laws that restrict certain business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Violations of these healthcare laws can result in significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties. Moreover, government coverage and reimbursement policies will both directly and indirectly impact our ability to successfully commercialize any future approved products, and such coverage and reimbursement policies will be impacted by enacted and any applicable future healthcare reform and drug pricing measures. Further, the United States and some foreign jurisdictions may consider and enact additional legislative and regulatory initiatives to change the healthcare system and modify these laws in ways that could affect the pharmaceutical industry.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Product Development Process
To establish a new product candidate’s safety and efficacy, the FDA requires companies seeking approval to market a pharmaceutical drug product to submit extensive preclinical and clinical data, along with other information, for each indication 
for which the product will be labeled. The data and information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (NDA), which must be accompanied by payment of a significant user fee unless a waiver or exemption applies. Generating the required data and information for an NDA takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. The failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a product candidate under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate. Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, each NDA submitted for FDA approval is given an internal administrative review within 60 days following submission of the NDA. If deemed sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will “file” the NDA. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established internal goals of eight months from submission for priority review of NDAs that cover new product candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, and 12 months from submission for the standard review of NDAs. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, these performance goals may change over time and the review is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the NDA can be approved. Before approving an NDA, the FDA can choose to inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with GMPs. The FDA may also audit sites at which clinical trials have been conducted to determine compliance with GCPs and data integrity. The FDA’s review of an NDA may also involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee, particularly for novel indications. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
As part of our clinical development plans, we are exploring the use of companion diagnostics to identify patients most likely to respond to our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are classified as medical devices under the FDCA in the United States and similarly in other foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates the medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, reporting, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, export and import, sales and distribution, and post-market surveillance of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostics require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (“PMA”).
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the cancer treatment to obtain a 510(k) clearance or PMA simultaneously with approval of the drug. Based on the draft guidance, and the FDA’s past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will require a PMA for one or more companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our product candidates. The review of these companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our product candidates involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such products and services. There is no uniform coverage and reimbursement policy among third-party payors in the United States; however, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices that are lower than they would otherwise be. The increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental 
laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
The market for our products and product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenue and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.

As of December 31, 2022, we had 593 employees of which 587 were full-time, exempt employees, one was a part-time, exempt employee, and the remaining were full-time, non-exempt employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
Culture
Fostering and maintaining a strong, healthy culture is fundamental to the success of our business. Our core values reflect who we are and the way our employees interact with one another, our partners, and stakeholders. Urgency, open-mindedness, accountability, and collaboration ground our work and behavior. These shared values are central to who we are, what we do, and how we do it. No matter the role, we are unified by our passion for helping patients, and we are inspired by a single vision – to unlock the science behind the promise of a life beyond cancer. We believe our culture creates strong engagement, which is measured through an annual employee-wide, anonymous survey to assess our performance on metrics including mission and vision, development and empowerment, our ability to adapt and overall employee satisfaction. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe diverse professional experiences and an inclusive culture can drive better outcomes for patients. Our culture is one where we challenge norms, have high risk tolerance and celebrate an entrepreneurial and courageous attitude full of grit and determination to make a difference. We strive to create a sense of belonging, and continuously seek to foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”). Our DE&I program, which was initiated in 2021, is led by our Chief Financial Officer and overseen by our DE&I Committee, which is comprised of cross-functional representatives from across the enterprise. 
In 2021, we surveyed all employees to inform our DE&I objectives and future employee training. Additionally, we recently assessed our performance across DE&I metrics. To address the feedback and findings, and to further our commitment to an environment of belonging, we organized our efforts across three pillars to serve as the foundation for achieving a fair and equitable environment where all Mirati employees can thrive: People, Culture and Community. The DE&I pillars are aligned to focus on key areas and goals in order to drive a positive impact for our employees and our business. 
Based on data as of November 1, 2022, 54% of our U.S. employees identify as female and 40% of our U.S. employees identify as being a racial or ethnic minority. As of December 31, 2022, 30% of our board of directors identify as female and 30% identify as being a racial or ethnic minority. We are committed to diversifying the representation of our organization.
