With growing competition and increasing economic sophistication, we believe more companies need strategies for cross-border restructuring and other corporate matters. Our plan is to bundle our Cross Border Business Solution services with our Cloud Accounting Solution.
 
Accounting Outsourcing Services
 
We intend to develop relationships with professional firms from Hong Kong, Malaysia and China that can provide company secretarial, business centers and virtual offices, book-keeping, tax compliance and planning, payroll management, business valuation, and wealth management services to our clients. We intend to include local accounting firms within this network to provide general accounting, financial evaluation and advisory services to our clients.

We believe that this accounting outsourcing service arrangement will be beneficial to our clients by providing a convenient, one-stop firm for their local and international business and financial compliance and governance needs.

We may also charge a flat rate fee or fixed fee based on the estimated complexity and timing of a project when our professionals provide specified expertise to our clients on a project. For example, for the cross-border business solutions, we plan to charge our client a monthly fixed fee.
Our Venture Capital Business Segment
 
Venture Capital Investment
 
As a result of our acquisition of Greenpro Venture Capital Limited in 2015, we entered the venture capital business in Hong Kong with a focus on companies located in Asia and South-East Asia, including Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, Thailand, and Singapore. Our venture capital business is focused on (1) establishing a business incubator for start-up and high growth companies to support such companies during critical growth periods and (2) investment opportunities in select start-up and high growth companies. .
 
We believe that a company’s life cycle can be divided into five stages, including the seed stage, start up stage, expansion stage, mature stage and decline stage.
 

● | Seed stage: Financing is needed for assets, and research and development of an initial business concept. The company usually has relatively low costs in developing the business idea. The ownership model is considered and implemented. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Start-up stage: Financing is needed for product development and initial marketing. Firms in this phase may be in the process of setting up a business or they might have been in operating the business for a short period of time, but may not have sold their products commercially. In this phase, costs are increasing due to. product development, market research and the need to recruit personnel. Low levels of revenues are starting to generate. 
● | Expansion stage: Financing is needed for growth and expansion. Capital may be used to finance increased production capacity, product or marketing development or to hire additional personnel. In the early expansion phase, sales and production increases but there is not yet any profit. In the later expansion stage, the business typically needs extra capital in addition to organically generated profit, for further development, marketing or product development. 

 
We anticipate that most of a company’s funding needs will occur during these first three stages.
 
We intend for our business incubators to provide valuable support to young, emerging growth and potential high growth companies at critical junctures of their development. For example, our incubators will offer office space at a below market rental rate. We will also provide our expertise, business contacts, introductions and other resources to assist their development and growth. Depending on each individual circumstance, we may also take an active advisory role in our venture capital companies including board representation, strategic marketing, corporate governance, and capital structuring. We believe that there will be potential investment opportunities for us in these start-up companies.

After that both parties arrive at an agreed value for the deal. Following that is a process of negotiation, which if successful, ends with capital transformation and restructuring. 
● | Step 3. Business Development and Value Adding: In addition to capital contribution, we expect to provide expertise, knowledge and relevant business contacts to the company. 
● | Step 4. Exit: There are several ways to exit an investment in a company. Common exits are:

Our objective for is to achieve a superior rate of return through the eventual and timely disposal of investments. We expect to look for businesses that meet the following criteria:
 

● | high growth prospects 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | ambitious teams 
● | viability of product or service 
● | experienced management 
● | ability to convert plans into reality 
● | justification of venture capital investment and investment criteria 

Our Venture Capital Related Education and Support Services.
 
In addition to providing venture capital services through GPVC, we also intend to provide educational and support services that we believe will be synergistic with our venture capital business. We intend to provide these educational services through our subsidiary Greenpro Capital Village Sdn. Bhd. Specifically, we expect to arrange one or more seminars called the CEO & Business Owners Strategic Session (CBOSS) for business owners who are interested in the following:

● | Developing their business globally; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------
● | Expanding business with increased capital funding; 
● | Creating a sustainable SME business model; 
● | Accelerating the growth of the business; and 
● | Significantly increasing company cash flows. 

 
The objective the CBOSS seminar is to educate the Chief Executive Officer or business owner on how to acquire “smart capital” and the considerations involved. We expect the seminar to include an introduction to the basic concepts of “smart capital,” “wealth and value creation,” recommendation and planning and similar topics. We believe that this seminar will synergistically support our venture capital business segment.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We plan to deploy three strategies to market the Greenpro brand: leadership, market segmentation, and sales management process development.
 

● | Building Brand Image: Greenpro’s marketing efforts will focus on building the image of the our extensive expertise and knowledge of our professionals. We intend to conduct a marketing campaign through media visibility, seminars, webinars, and the creation of a wide variety of white papers, newsletters, books, and other information. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Market segmentation: We plan to devote marketing resources to the highly measurable and high return on investment tactics that specifically target those industries and areas where Greenpro has particularly deep experience and capabilities. These efforts typically involve local, regional or national trade show and event sponsorships, targeted direct mail, email, and telemarketing campaigns, and practice and industry specific micro-sites, newsletters, etc. in the Asia region. 
● | Social Media: We plan to begin a social media campaign utilizing blogs, twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn after we secure sufficient financing. A targeted campaign will be made to the following groups of clients: law firms, auditing firms, consulting firms, small to mid-size enterprises in different industries, including biotechnologies, intellectual property, information technologies and real estate.

Market Opportunities
 
We intend to assist our clients in the cost-effective preparation of their financial statements and provide security based on such financial information since the data will be stored in the cloud system. We anticipate a market with growing needs in South-East Asia. We believe that today there is an increasing need for enterprises in different industries to maximize their performance with cost-effective methods. We believe our services will create numerous competitive advantages for our clients. We believe our clients can focus on developing their businesses and expanding their own client portfolio.
 
We believe the main drivers for the growth of our business are the products and services together with the resources such as an office network, professional staff members, and operational tools to make the advisory and consulting business more competitive.
 
Customers
 
Before the acquisitions previously described, we generated minimal revenue from three clients in Hong Kong. The revenue generated related to assisting these clients with company formation and secretary services. As a result of the new acquisition, we expect to generate revenues from clients located globally including those from Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Russia, USA. Our venture capital business segment will initially focus on Hong Kong and South-East Asia start-ups and high growth companies. We hope to generate deal flow through personal contacts of our management team as well as through our business incubator.
 
We generated net revenues of $2,776,435 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Our venture capital business accounted for approximately two percent of our net revenue. We are not a party to any long-term agreements with our customers.
 
Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive. We compete with local and international venture capital, financial advisory and corporate business service companies such as Cornerstone Management Group in Hong Kong, CST Tax Advisor in Singapore and Maceda Valencia & Co in Philippines that provide services comparable to our Package Solution. We also compete with numerous local and international financial advisory and corporate business service companies, however those companies do not offer our broad range of services. They typically focus on specialized areas such as tax planning and cross-border solutions.. Some of our competitors may provide a broader selection of services, including investment banking services, which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single company to meet all of their financial and business advisory needs. In addition, some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, may have substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do. We believe that we compete on the basis of a number of factors, including breadth of service and product offerings, one stop convenience, pricing, marketing expertise, service levels, technological capabilities and integration, brand and reputation.
Intellectual Property
 
We intend to protect our investment in the research and development of our products and technologies. We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by a particular jurisdiction. Currently, our revenue is derived principally from our operations in Hong Kong and Malaysia, where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of intellectual property.
 
We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.

We rely on trade secrets and un-patentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. Our policy is to require some of our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
 
Government Regulation
 
We intend to provide our Package Solution initially in Hong Kong, China and Malaysia, which we believe would welcome outsourcing support services. Further, we believe these markets are the central and regional markets for many customers doing cross border businesses in Asia. We plan to target those customers from South-East Asia doing international business and plan to provide our Package Solution to meet their needs. Our planned Packaged Solution will be structured in Hong Kong but services may be outsourced to lower cost jurisdictions such as Malaysia, which encourage and welcome outsourcing services.
 
The following regulations are the applicable laws and regulations that may be applicable to us:

We are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period). Employers and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5% of the employee’s relevant income to an MPF scheme, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels.

Malaysia
 
Our businesses located in Malaysia are subject to the general laws in Malaysia governing businesses including labor, occupational safety and health, general corporations, intellectual property and other similar laws including the Computer Crime Act 1997 and The Copyright (Amendment) Act 1997. We believe that the focus of these laws realize it is an issue of censorship in Malaysia. But we believe this issue will not impact our businesses because the censorship focus on media controls and does not relate to cloud based technology we plan to use.

Employment Contracts
 
The Employment Contract Law was promulgated by the National People’s Congress’ Standing Committee on June 29, 2007 and took effect on January 1, 2008. The Employment Contract Law governs labor relations and employment contracts (including the entry into, performance, amendment, termination and determination of employment contracts) between domestic enterprises (including foreign-invested companies), individual economic organizations and private non-enterprise units (collectively referred to as the “employers”) and their employees.
 
a. Execution of employment contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, an employer is required to execute written employment contracts with its employees within one month from the commencement of employment. In the event of contravention, an employee is entitled to receive double salary for the period during which the employer fails to execute an employment contract. If an employer fails to execute an employment contract for more than 12 months from the commencement of the employee’s employment, an employment contract would be deemed to have been entered into between the employer and employee for a non-fixed term.
 
b. Right to non-fixed term contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, an employee may request for a non-fixed term contract without an employer’s consent to renew. In addition, an employee is also entitled to a non-fixed term contract with an employer if he has completed two fixed term employment contracts with such employer; however, such employee must not have committed any breach or have been subject to any disciplinary actions during his employment. Unless the employee requests to enter into a fixed term contract, an employer who fails to enter into a non-fixed term contract pursuant to the Employment Contract Law is liable to pay the employee double salary from the date the employment contract is renewed.
 
c. Compensation for termination or expiry of employment contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, employees are entitled to compensation upon the termination or expiry of an employment contract. Employees are entitled to compensation even in the event the employer (i) has been declared bankrupt; (ii) has its business license revoked; (iii) has been ordered to cease or withdraw its business; or (iv) has been voluntarily liquidated. Where an employee has been employed for more than one year, the employee will be entitled to such compensation equivalent to one month’s salary for every completed year of service. Where an employee has employed for less than one year, such employee will be deemed to have completed one full year of service.
 
d. Trade union and collective employment contracts
 
Under the Employment Contract Law, a trade union may seek arbitration and litigation to resolve any dispute arising from a collective employment contract; provided that such dispute failed to be settled through negotiations. The Employment Contract Law also permits a trade union to enter into a collective employee contract with an employer on behalf of all the employees.

Where a trade union has not been formed, a representative appointed under the recommendation of a high-level trade union may execute the collective employment contract. Within districts below county level, collective employment contracts for industries such as those engaged in construction, mining, food and beverage and those from the service sector, etc., may be executed on behalf of employees by the representatives from the trade union of each respective industry. Alternatively, a district-based collective employment contract may be entered into.
 
As a result of the Employment Contract Law, all of our employees have executed standard written employment agreements with us. We have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulties in recruiting staff for our operations.
 
On October 28, 2010, the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the PRC Social Insurance Law, which became effective on July 1, 2011. In accordance with the PRC Social Insurance Law, the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social Security Fund and other relevant laws and regulations, China establishes a social insurance system including basic pension insurance, basic medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance. An employer shall pay the social insurance for its employees in accordance with the rates provided under relevant regulations and shall withhold the social insurance that should be assumed by the employees. The authorities in charge of social insurance may request an employer’s compliance and impose sanctions if such employer fails to pay and withhold social insurance in a timely manner. Under the Regulations on the Administration of Housing Fund effective in 1999, as amended in 2002, PRC companies must register with applicable housing fund management centers and establish a special housing fund account in an entrusted bank. Both PRC companies and their employees are required to contribute to the housing funds.
 
The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security promulgated the Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch on January 24, 2014. The Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch, which became effective on March 1, 2014, sets forth that labor dispatch should only be applicable to temporary, auxiliary or substitute positions. Temporary positions shall mean positions subsisting for no more than six months, auxiliary positions shall mean positions of non-major business that serve positions of major businesses, and substitute positions shall mean positions that can be held by substitute employees for a certain period of time during which the employees who originally hold such positions are unable to work as a result of full-time study, being on leave or other reasons. The Interim Provisions further provides that, the number of the dispatched workers of an employer shall not exceed 10% of its total workforce, and the total workforce of an employer shall refer to the sum of the number of the workers who have executed labor contracts with the employer and the number of workers who are dispatched to the employer.
 
Foreign Exchange Control and Administration
 
Foreign exchange in China is primarily regulated by:
 

● | The Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), or the Administration Rules. 

 
Under the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, if documents certifying the purposes of the conversion of RMB into foreign currency are submitted to the relevant foreign exchange conversion bank, the RMB will be convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest and royalties payments, and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loans, securities investment and repatriation of investment, however, is subject to the approval of SAFE or its local counterpart.
 
Under the Administration Rules for the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange, foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from SAFE or its local counterpart.

As an offshore holding company with a PRC subsidiary, we may (i) make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, (ii) establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, (iii) make loans to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities, or (iv) acquire offshore entities with business operations in China in offshore transactions. However, most of these uses are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example:
 

● | capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, whether existing or newly established ones, must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries, each of which is a foreign-invested enterprise, to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE or its local branches; and 
● | loans by us to our consolidated affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities, must be approved by the National Development and Reform Commission and must also be registered with SAFE or its local branches. 

 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues concerning the Improvement of the Administration of Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or “Circular 142”. On March 30, 2015, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Concerning Reform of the Administrative Approaches to Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or “Circular 19”, which became effective on June 1, 2015, to regulate the conversion by foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, of foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. Circular 19 requires that Renminbi converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital of a FIE shall be managed under the Accounts for FX settlement and pending payment. The expenditure scope of such Account includes: expenditure within the business scope, payment of funds for domestic equity investment and Renminbi deposits, repayment of the Renminbi loans after completed utilization and so forth. A FIE shall truthfully use its capital by itself within the business scope and shall not, directly or indirectly, use its capital or Renminbi converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital for (i) expenditure beyond its business scope or expenditure prohibited by laws or regulations, (ii) disbursing Renminbi entrusted loans (unless permitted under its business scope), repaying inter-corporate borrowings (including third-party advance) and repaying Renminbi bank loans already refinanced to any third party. Where a FIE, other than a foreign-invested investment company, foreign-invested venture capital enterprise or foreign-invested equity investment enterprise, makes domestic equity investment by transferring its capital in the original currency, it shall obey the current provisions on domestic re-investment. Where such a FIE makes domestic equity investment by its Renminbi conversion, the invested enterprise shall first go through domestic re-investment registration and open a corresponding Accounts for FX settlement and pending payment, and the FIE shall thereafter transfer the conversion to the aforesaid Account according to the actual amount of investment. In addition, according to the Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Foreign Exchange Administration, which became effective on August 5, 2008, the use of foreign exchange or Renminbi conversion may not be changed without authorization.
 
Violations of the applicable circulars and rules may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations.
 
In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans to our PRC subsidiary or future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiary. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds we expect to receive from this offering and the concurrent private placement and to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.
