Marine Engine Segment
The Marine Engine segment, which had net sales of $2,441.1 million in 2016, consists of the Mercury Marine Group (Mercury Marine). We believe our Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of recreational marine engines and marine parts and accessories. 

Mercury Marine manufactures and markets a full range of outboard, sterndrive and inboard engine and propulsion systems under the Mercury, Mercury MerCruiser, Mariner, Mercury Racing, Mercury Sport Jet, Mercury Jet Drive, Mercury Diesel, Sea Pro, Axius and Zeus brand names. In addition, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets marine parts and accessories under the Quicksilver, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Attwood, Garelick, Whale, Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Payne's Marine Group, BLA, Seachoice and MotorGuide brand names, including marine electronics and control integration systems, steering systems, instruments, controls, propellers, trolling motors, fuel systems, service parts and lubricants. Mercury Marine also supplies integrated, high-speed diesel propulsion systems to the worldwide recreational and commercial marine markets.
Mercury Marine's outboard, sterndrive and inboard engines are sold to independent boat builders, local, state and foreign governments and to Brunswick's Boat segment. In addition, Mercury Marine sells outboard engines through a global network of more than 6,000 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers and marine service centers. White River Marine Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (including Tracker Boats) is Mercury Marine’s most significant external customer.
Mercury Marine manufactures four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 400 horsepower and two-stroke OptiMax outboard engines, all of which feature Mercury's direct fuel injection (DFI) technology, ranging from 150 to 300 horsepower. All of these low-emission engines are in compliance with applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements. Mercury Marine's four-stroke outboard engines include Verado, a collection of supercharged outboards ranging from 175 to 400 horsepower, and Mercury Marine's naturally aspirated four-stroke outboards, ranging from 2.5 to 150 horsepower, including the 75 to 115 horsepower FourStroke, introduced in 2014, which has become known for its light weight, fuel efficiency and performance. Mercury Marine also manufactures two-stroke, non-DFI engines for certain markets outside the United States. In addition, most of Mercury's sterndrive and inboard engines are now available with catalyst exhaust treatment and monitoring systems, and all 
1

are compliant with applicable U.S. state and federal environmental regulations. Mercury also makes engines that comply with global emissions and noise regulations.
Mercury Marine and Mercury Racing manufacture inboard and sterndrive engine models ranging from 115 to 1,650 horsepower. In 2016, Mercury Racing debuted the 32-valve DOHC SB4 7.0 automotive aftermarket crate engine, which adapts a high performance valve train to a customized LS based engine and produces 775 naturally aspirated horsepower, significantly improved performance and durability.
To promote advanced propulsion systems with improved handling, performance and efficiency, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets advanced boat steering and engine control systems under the brand names of Mercury, Zeus and Axius. In 2016, Mercury officially launched Active Trim, an auto-trimming device that simplifies boat operation while improving engine performance and fuel efficiency.

Mercury Marine produces its gasoline sterndrive and outboard engines domestically in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with outboard engines also produced internationally in China and Japan. Mercury Marine manufactures 40, 50 and 60 horsepower four-stroke outboard engines in a facility in China, and produces smaller outboard engines in Japan pursuant to a joint venture with its partner, Tohatsu Corporation. Mercury Marine sources engine components from a global supply base and manufactures additional engine component parts at its Fond du Lac facility and plants in Florida and Mexico. Mercury Marine also operates a remanufacturing business for engines and service parts in Wisconsin. In addition, Mercury Marine has an equity ownership interest in Bella-Veneet Oy, which manufactures boats under the brand names Bella, Flipper and Aquador in Finland.  
In March 2016, Mercury introduced VesselView Mobile, unveiling a digital application that instantly provides users access to their boat’s SmartCraft® digital data. VesselView Mobile, along with Mercury's Electronic Steering Helm (introduced in February 2016), each earned Innovation Awards at the 2016 International Boatbuilders Exhibition and Conference. Mercury also earned “Green Master” designation from the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council for the sixth consecutive year, a program measuring a broad range of sustainability issues ranging from energy and water conservation to waste management, community outreach and education.
On November 18, 2016, Brunswick acquired substantially all of the assets of Payne's Marine Group (Payne's), based in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Payne's is a leading wholesale distributor of marine parts and accessories in Canada. We believe this acquisition will broaden the reach of our marine parts and accessories distribution network in the Canadian market. 
Our parts and accessories distribution and products businesses include: Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, BLA, Payne's, Attwood Marine, Garelick Mfg. Co. and Whale. These businesses are leading manufacturers and distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities. 

Intercompany sales to Brunswick's Boat segment represented approximately 12 percent of Mercury Marine's sales in 2016. Domestic demand for the Marine Engine segment's products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.

Boat Segment
The Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and markets: fiberglass pleasure boats; yachts and sport yachts; sport cruisers and sport boats; offshore fishing boats; aluminum and fiberglass fishing boats; pontoon boats; utility boats; deck boats; inflatable boats; and heavy-gauge aluminum boats. We believe that the Boat Group, which had net sales of $1,369.9 million during 2016, is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of pleasure motorboats.

The Boat Group manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into boat manufacturing and design processes.

The Boat Group includes the following boat brands: Sea Ray L-Class yachts, yachts, sport yachts, sport cruisers and sport boats; Bayliner sport cruisers, runabouts and Heyday wake boats; Meridian yachts; Boston Whaler and Lund fiberglass fishing boats; Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats and deck boats; and Thunder Jet heavy-gauge aluminum boats. The Boat Group also includes a commercial and governmental sales unit that sells products to commercial customers, as well as to the United States government and state, local and foreign governments. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment. 
2

The Boat Group also includes several Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia-Pacific, such as Quicksilver, Uttern and Rayglass (including Protector and Legend), which are typically equipped with Mercury Marine engines and often include other parts and accessories supplied by Mercury Marine.

The Boat Group operates manufacturing facilities in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Tennessee, Washington, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, and owns an inactive manufacturing facility in North Carolina. The Boat Group utilizes contract manufacturing facilities in Poland. 
On July 1, 2016, Brunswick acquired substantially all of the assets of privately held Thunder Jet Boats, Inc. (Thunder Jet), which is based in Clarkston, Washington. Thunder Jet is a designer and builder of heavy-gauge aluminum boats. We believe this acquisition will add breadth and depth to the Boat Group's overall product portfolio, including in the growing heavy-gauge aluminum market. Thunder Jet is managed within the Boat Group. 
The Boat Group sells its products through a global network of approximately 3,000 dealer and distributor locations, which may carry more than one of Brunswick's boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax, Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 24 percent of Boat Group sales in 2016. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.
Fitness Segment
Our Fitness segment is comprised of the Fitness division (Fitness), which designs, manufactures and markets a full line of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, Cybex, Indoor Cycling Group and SCIFIT brands. The Fitness segment also includes InMovement products for productive well-being and our active recreation business, including billiards tables, accessories and game room furniture. 
We believe that our Fitness segment, which had net sales of $980.4 million during 2016, is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment. Fitness' commercial customers include health clubs, corporations, schools and universities, hotels, professional and collegiate sports teams, retirement and assisted living facilities and the military and governmental agencies. Planet Fitness Inc. is the segment's most significant customer. Fitness makes commercial sales through its direct sales force, domestic dealers and international distributors. Consumer products are available at specialty retailers, select mass merchants, sporting goods stores, through international distributors and on the Life Fitness website.
The billiards business was established in 1845 and is Brunswick's heritage business. The billiards business designs and markets billiards tables, table tennis tables and Air Hockey tables, as well as game room furniture and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands. InMovement is a business dedicated to addressing workplace inactivity and combating the harmful effects of a sedentary lifestyle by offering products designed to incorporate subtle movement into employee work habits. 
On January 20, 2016, we acquired 100 percent of privately held Cybex International, Inc. (Cybex), a leading manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment, which is currently based in Medway, Massachusetts. Cybex offers a full line of cardiovascular and strength products. We believe the acquisition will expand the Fitness segment's participation in key markets, including commercial fitness, and add to our manufacturing footprint to meet current and future demand more effectively. On August 31, 2016, we acquired 100 percent of Indoor Cycling Group (ICG), a market leader specializing in the design of indoor cycling equipment, based in Nuremburg, Germany. We believe the ICG acquisition will strengthen our position in indoor cycling and provide a strong foundation to expand in the growing group exercise market. Cybex and ICG are managed within the Fitness segment.
The Fitness segment's principal manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Hungary, with principal third party contract manufacturing partners in China and Taiwan. Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year.
Discontinued Operations
On July 17, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our retail bowling business to AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. (AMF). In connection with our decision to sell the bowling centers, we also announced our intention to divest our bowling products business. The billiards business, which was previously reported in the Bowling & Billiards segment, remains part of the Company and is 
3

being reported in the Fitness segment for all periods presented. On September 18, 2014, we completed the sale of our retail bowling business to AMF. On May 22, 2015, we completed the sale of our bowling products business to BlueArc Capital Management L.L.C. As a result of these actions, these businesses, which were previously recorded in the Bowling & Billiards segment, are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. We do not have or anticipate having any significant continuing involvement or continuing cash flows associated with these businesses. Refer to Note 2 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Financial Services
Through our Brunswick Financial Services Corporation subsidiary, we own a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to our boat and engine dealers. Prior to March 1, 2016, CDF Ventures, LLC (CDFV), a subsidiary of GE Capital Corporation (GECC), owned the remaining 51 percent. On March 1, 2016, GECC sold its Commercial Distribution Finance business, including CDFV and its interest in the BAC joint venture, to Wells Fargo & Company. The transaction did not have a material effect on BAC.
Effective July 31, 2015, the joint venture was extended through December 31, 2019. The joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or purchase of the other party's interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the agreement at the end of its term. In June 2016, the parties amended the joint venture agreement to adjust a financial covenant that was conformed to the maximum leverage ratio test contained in our revolving credit facility described in Note 16 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, we offer financial services through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, which provides marine dealers the opportunity to offer extended product warranties to retail customers, and through Blue Water Dealer Services, Inc., which provides retail financial services to marine dealers. Each company allows us to offer a more complete line of financial services to our boat and marine engine dealers and their customers.

Refer to Note 10 – Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our financial services.

Distribution
We utilize distributors, dealers and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of our boat sales and significant portions of our sales of marine engine, fitness and billiards products. We have over 16,000 Dealers serving our business segments worldwide. Our marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories - boats, engines and related parts and accessories.

We own Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply and Payne's Marine Group, which comprise the primary parts and accessories distribution platforms for our Marine Engine segment in North America. We believe that these businesses, collectively, are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 20 distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. We also believe we are the leading parts and accessories distributor in the Asia-Pacific region.

Our Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell our products exclusively, while a majority also carry competitors' and complementary products. We partner with our boat dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience.

Demand for a significant portion of our products is seasonal, and a number of our Dealers are relatively small and/or highly-leveraged. As a result, many dealers secure floor plan financing from BAC or other third party finance companies, enabling them to provide stable channels for our products. In addition to the financing BAC offers, we may also provide our Dealers with incentive programs, loan guarantees, inventory repurchase commitments and financing receivable arrangements, under which we are obligated to repurchase inventory or receivables from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. We believe that these arrangements are in our best interest; however, these arrangements expose us to credit and business risk. Our business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and we continually seek opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of our various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 8 – Financing Receivables and Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.

International Operations
Our sales to customers in markets other than the United States were $1,457.0 million (32 percent of net sales), $1,377.9 million (33 percent of net sales) and $1,438.7 million (37 percent of net sales) in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We transact a portion of our sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, while a meaningful portion of our product costs are denominated in U.S. dollars as a result of our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of our non-U.S. operations. 
Non-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 6 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details our non-U.S. sales by region:

(in millions) | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Europe | $ | 569.2 | | | $ | 506.0 | | $ | 533.5 
Canada | 284.6 | | | 282.9 | | | 302.4
Asia-Pacific | 363.1 | | | 307.9 | | | 286.0
Latin America | 151.2 | | | 183.2 | | | 219.0
Africa & Middle East | 88.9 | | | 97.9 | | | 97.8 
Total | $ | 1,457.0 | | | $ | 1,377.9 | | $ | 1,438.7

Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 47 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2016. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following:

• | Distribution, sales, service and applications engineering offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore;


• | Sales or representative offices in Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden and Switzerland;


• | A component manufacturing facility in Mexico;


• | An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China;


• | An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan; and


• | A parts and accessories manufacturing facility in Northern Ireland.

Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 23 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2016. The Boat Group manufactures or assembles a portion of its products in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated by third parties in Poland that perform contract manufacturing for us, and are sold worldwide through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland and Sweden.
Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 30 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2016. Life Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets, and has relationships with third party contract manufacturing partners in China and Taiwan.

Raw Materials and Supplies
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including aluminum, resins, oil and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise our production costs, which could reduce profitability if we did not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices.

As our manufacturing operations continued to raise production levels in 2016, our need for raw materials and supplies increased. During 2016, we experienced some shortages or delayed delivery of certain materials, parts and supplies essential to our manufacturing operations. We have addressed and will continue to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In 2017, we anticipate our suppliers will need to increase their manufacturing operations to meet the rising demand for their products and, in many cases, may need to hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by us and other customers. 

We also continue to expand our global procurement operations to better leverage purchasing power across our divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. We mitigate commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by entering into fixed priced contracts to mitigate exposure related to changes in commodity prices.

Intellectual Property
We have, and continue to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of our products and processes. By law, our patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. We believe that our patent rights are important to our competitive position in all of our business segments. Our trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets. Most of our intellectual property is owned by U.S. entities. 

In the Marine Engine segment, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys; and airflow silencers.

In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to interiors and other boat features and components.

In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling, as well as billiards table designs and components and active workplace furniture and equipment.

The following are our principal trademarks: 
Marine Engine Segment: Attwood, Axius, Garelick, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land 'N' Sea, Mariner, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Quicksilver, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, Sport-Jet, Swivl-Eze, Valiant, Verado, Whale and Zeus.
Boat Segment: Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Heyday, Lowe, Lund, Master Dealer, Meridian, Princecraft, Protector, Quicksilver, Rayglass, Sea Ray, Thunder Jet and Uttern.
Fitness Segment: Air Hockey, Brunswick, Contender, Cybex, Flex Deck, Gold Crown, Hammer Strength, Indoor Cycling Group, InMovement, Lifecycle, Life Fitness and SCIFIT.
Competitive Conditions and Position
We believe that we have a reputation for quality in each of our highly competitive lines of business. We compete in various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening our leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising and sales efforts; providing high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket products.

Strong competition exists in each of our product groups, but no single enterprise competes with us in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. We also indirectly compete with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities.
 The following summarizes our competitive position in each segment:

Marine Engine Segment:  We believe the Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of recreational and commercial marine engines and marine parts and accessories. The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, including Japanese-based outboard engine manufacturers, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution.

Boat Segment:  We believe that the Boat segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure motorboats. There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. Consequently, this business is both highly competitive and highly fragmented. We believe that we have the broadest range of boat product offerings in the world, with boats ranging in size from 10 to 65 feet. In all of our boat operations, we compete on the basis of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution.
6

 Fitness Segment:  We believe we are the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment and billiards tables. The fitness equipment industry is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, as well as many smaller manufacturers, which creates a highly fragmented, competitive landscape. Many of our fitness equipment offerings include industry-leading product features, and we place significant emphasis on introducing innovative fitness equipment to the market. Competitive focus is also placed on product quality, technology, service, pricing, state-of-the-art biomechanics and effective promotional activities. The billiards industry continues to experience competitive pressure from low-cost billiards manufacturers outside the United States, and InMovement products also face competition, primarily from furniture manufacturers and distributors. 

Research and Development
We strive to improve our competitive position in all of our segments by continuously investing in research and development to drive innovation in our products and manufacturing technologies. Our research and development investments support the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. Research and development expenses were 3.1 percent of net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Research and development expenses by segment are discussed in Note 6 – Segment Information.
