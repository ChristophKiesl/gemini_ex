Item 1. Business
Our Mission
Our mission is to drive health plan growth and member engagement by leveraging proprietary technology and processes.
Our core values — integrity, teamwork, and regulatory compliance — are the foundation upon which we approach the market.
Business Overview
Convey Health is a leading healthcare platform that utilizes technology and processes to improve government-sponsored health plans, including Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans. We help health plans grow membership and revenue as well as operate more effectively and efficiently. We are a trusted solutions-oriented partner to payors and deliver purpose-built technology and services to enhance our clients’ mission-critical workflows. Our solutions address health plan needs, including product development and sales, member experience management, clinical management, core operations, business intelligence and analytics. Leveraging our technology and expert advisory services, we serve as a unified and integrated extension of our clients’ core health plan operations. Our proprietary, modular technology and end-to-end solutions replace or supplement our clients’ existing systems and processes, enabling us to help health plans attract and retain members, improve revenue accuracy, drive cost savings, facilitate regulatory compliance, and enhance operational effectiveness.
Since our inception, we have created and continuously refined our technology solutions to best serve government-sponsored health plans. Our clients are primarily MA plans, Medicare Part D plans (“PDP”) including Employer Group Waiver plans and pharmacy benefit managers (“PBM”). As of December 31, 2021, our solutions managed over 3.5 million MA members and 1.6 million PDP members. Additionally, our value-based analytics, which are powered by our 35 million member data set, provided actionable insights for nearly 7.3 million MA members in 2021.
We foster long-term collaborative partnerships as evidenced by our average relationship with our top 10 clients of over eight years, and we serve as a partner to nine of the nation’s top 10 MA payors by lives covered, in each case as of December 31, 2021. We believe that we have significant opportunity to grow within our existing client base as the majority of our clients currently subscribe to only a subset of our overall solutions and services. Moreover, we believe we have significant opportunity to grow by winning new clients in the MA market, by selling more products to our existing clients, by expanding into adjacent markets such as Medicaid and commercial insurance, and through complementary strategic acquisitions.
Our clients face significant and constantly evolving challenges managing their Medicare health plans:
•Increasingly Competitive Environment for Medicare Plans: Effective benefit design and sales are critical to retaining and growing members during the Medicare annual enrollment period. Once members are enrolled in a plan, effective member engagement and supplemental benefits administration are paramount to ensuring strong satisfaction and retention. Moreover, the proliferation of value-based reimbursement models such as MA requires effective member management and broad ecosystem coordination, which fall outside the core competencies of many health plans.
•Compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Requirements: Constantly evolving CMS and client requirements result in hundreds of modifications per year that inhibit the operational effectiveness and capabilities of health plans. Our purpose-built government sector technology platform addresses these constantly evolving requirements.
•Complex and Highly Regulated Medicare Market: Many health plans enter the government plan market by simply adapting their existing systems designed for the commercial insurance market. As a result, the technology they employ often lacks the sophistication and design needed to effectively maintain and administer benefits tailored for the complex and highly regulated Medicare market.
Health plans increasingly recognize the need for specialized solutions like ours to help them overcome these challenges and drive superior performance. We believe our proprietary technology and processes facilitate member engagement, health plan growth and operational efficiencies:
•We Drive Member Engagement and Health Plan Growth in the Highly Attractive Medicare Advantage Market
MA is a highly attractive and fast-growing market, with membership expected to increase by 38% from 2020 to 2025, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. This outsized growth is supported by higher member satisfaction, lower costs and 
better member outcomes of managed plans as compared to traditional Medicare plans. Moreover, MA lives are attractive to health plans as they provide a higher value per covered person than commercial lives. Between 2016 and 2018, the annual gross margin per covered person in the MA market averaged $1,608.00, approximately double the annual gross margin per covered person in the commercial insurance market. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of U.S. seniors is expected to grow to 73.1 million by 2030, up from 56.1 million in 2020 and to increase as a percentage of the population from 17% to 21% during the same time period.
We help MA plans compete by improving benefit design, managing the member experience and core operations, administering supplemental benefits, empowering data-driven insights and providing expert advisory services. For example, we were an early pioneer in over-the-counter (“OTC”) supplemental benefit administration as we recognized that health plans that offer supplemental benefits could gain a competitive advantage over health plans that do not. MA plans offering OTC benefits grew their membership by 11% for 2022 enrollment compared to membership decline of 6% for plans that did not offer such benefits. We believe we are a leader in providing technology-enabled solutions for the government-sponsored market and are well positioned to help our MA clients deliver differentiated plan offerings and drive sustained, above-market growth.
•We Drive Operational Efficiencies in a Highly Complex and Regulated Government Plan Market
We help health plans improve operational effectiveness and enhance regulatory compliance. Through our advanced plan administration and supplemental benefit administration solutions, we handle critical processes on behalf of our clients, including eligibility and enrollment, member services, order processing and fulfillment, premium billing administration, premium payment processing, utilization management, payment integrity and regulatory compliance. We have dedicated compliance and quality-control teams that monitor evolving healthcare regulations and partner with our clients to facilitate compliance with the ever-changing set of government requirements.
Moreover, leveraging our large proprietary datasets and applied analytics, we yield actionable insights through our value-based payment assurance solutions that resolve gaps in care, improve member risk scoring and enhance payment integrity.
In addition, our technology and processes remove friction, streamline workflows and increase the effectiveness of each member interaction. For example, because our Advanced Plan Administration platform is a single integrated system that communicates seamlessly, we are able to improve member experience and core operations by reducing the time for a member to complete an address change with potential disenrollment by 75% and to complete a premium billing credit card transaction by 47%.
We operate in two segments: Technology Enabled Solutions (“TES”), in which we provide technology and support solutions to our clients, and Advisory Services (“Advisory”), in which we provide project-based consulting services led by our long-tenured subject matter experts. Our TES segment was approximately 84% of our consolidated revenue and our Advisory segment was approximately 16% for the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe that our combination of technology and advisory solutions gives us a competitive advantage in the government-sponsored health plan market. Our TES and Advisory teams collaborate effectively to combine a strong technology platform with deep domain expertise to deliver best-in-class solutions to our clients. Furthermore, we leverage the Advisory team’s industry expertise to identify new opportunities as well as cross-sell our solutions within existing clients.
We have a highly predictable and recurring revenue model with strong cash flow from operations. We typically charge a recurring subscription or per-member fee or a re-occurring utilization-based fee, which, coupled with our long-term contracts and strong client retention, has historically provided us with strong revenue visibility into estimated future revenue. Our TES segment historically has been highly predictable as most of our revenue in any given year is under contract or otherwise visible by the beginning of that year due to the contract structures we employ. We evaluate client retention primarily on a revenue retention basis, and we monitor two key metrics to evaluate client retention: Technology Gross Dollar Retention (“GDR”) and Technology Net Dollar Retention (“NDR”). GDR measures the performance of existing solutions on an existing client basis by taking our Annual Contracted Revenue (“ACR”) at the beginning of the fiscal period and reducing it by dollar attrition during the fiscal period. ACR at the beginning of the fiscal period is equal to the prior year total revenue for our reported TES segment. Our GDR was 99%, 98% and 99% in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our high client retention, as measured on a revenue retention basis, demonstrates the predictability of our revenue and that our existing solutions are deeply embedded in our clients’ core operations. NDR measures the performance rate of existing clients in total and before new client wins by adding cross-sell and upsell initiatives to GDR. Our NDR was 117%, 135% and 142% in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, exhibiting the strength of our platform and growth of our existing client base. Figures for 2019 are based on the Successor period from June 13, 2019 to December 2019 and the Predecessor period from January 1, 2019 to September 3, 2019.
We generated $337.6 million, $282.9 million, $80.4 million, and $140.7 million in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, the year ended December 31, 2020, the Successor period, and the Predecessor period, respectively. We had net (loss) income of $(10.0) million, $(6.5) million, $(16.8) million, and $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, the year ended December 31, 2020, the Successor period, and the Predecessor period, respectively. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $69.2 million, $51.5 million, $14.0 million, and $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, the year ended December 31, 2020, the Successor period, and the Predecessor period, respectively. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had $192.6 million total aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness.
Our Solutions
Technology Enabled Solutions
Our Technology Enabled Solutions Platform is Purpose-built to Comprehensively Address our Clients’ Needs
We are a solutions-oriented partner to health plans, helping them attract and retain members, improve revenue accuracy, drive cost savings, facilitate regulatory compliance, and enhance operational effectiveness. We have built a flexible architecture that enables deep and broad-based integration with client and third party systems and allows us to meet our clients’ core operational, regulatory, financial and clinical needs.
The Backbone of our Offerings is our Proprietary Technology Platform, Miramar
Miramar reduces the number of systems that health plans need to maintain, providing a seamless, unified user experience for our clients and their members. Our clients often depend exclusively on Miramar to manage mission-critical workflows, which entrenches our client relationships and provides opportunities to both cross-sell additional offerings and develop new technologies in partnership with them. Miramar’s agile infrastructure enables us to rapidly deploy and scale new and innovative offerings. In 2021, Miramar processed over 3.1 billion automated transactions through integrated processes with health plans, members, employer groups, government entities, provider organizations, PBMs and financial institutions. In that same time period, we facilitated over 29 million touchpoints with members on behalf of our clients.
Miramar consists of three core end-to-end solutions in addition to ancillary modular solutions:
•Advanced Plan Administration (“APA”) Solutions: We provide technology-based plan administration services for government-sponsored health plans. Our solution encompasses eligibility and enrollment processing, member services, premium billing and payment processing, reconciliation and other related services.
•Supplemental Benefit Administration (“SBA”) Solutions: We provide technology and services to manage supplemental benefits provided to members through their MA plans. This solution is currently focused on the OTC benefit and we continue to extend our platform into additional supplemental benefits. Our SBA solutions include benefit design and administration, member eligibility and engagement, product fulfillment, and analytics and reporting.
•Value-Based Payment Assurance (“Value-Based”) Solutions: We provide payment tools and data analytics to improve revenue accuracy and identify gaps in quality, clinical care and compliance.
Advisory Services
Our Advisory Services Team Supports Payor Operations and Drives Business Model Evolution
We provide Advisory Services that complement our technology-enabled solutions in sales and marketing strategies, provider network strategies, compliance, operations, Star Ratings, quality, clinical, pharmacy, analytics and risk adjustment. We believe the trust our subject matter experts have earned with our clients gives us unique insights into and differentiated access to marketplace opportunities.
Industry Backdrop
We primarily operate within the government-sponsored health plan market. We believe that the increasing demand for our end-to-end platform solutions is driven by the following key healthcare industry tailwinds:
•Growth in Medicare-Eligible Beneficiaries & Privatization Trend: According to U.S. Census data, the 65-and-older population in the U.S. grew by over 33% during the past decade, which resulted in an increasingly large Medicare population base that we expect will continue to grow given the demographics trend. MA enrollment grew by a 7% compound annual growth rate from 2015 to 2020 and is expected to grow at that same 7% growth rate from 2020 
to 2025. In addition, MA enrollment as a percentage of total Medicare enrollment is expected to grow from 38.7% in 2020 to 46.5% in 2025. Additionally, approximately 70% of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in plans that provide Medicare Part D benefits, with enrollment doubling since the program began in 2006. Moreover, there is increasing focus by recent presidential administrations to grow government-sponsored healthcare. The growing Medicare population base and MA enrollment, coupled with the potential expansion of government-sponsored healthcare, represent important tailwinds for our business.

•Increased Reliance on Specialized, Technology-Enabled Third-Party Partners to Drive Health Plan Differentiation and Performance: Competition for MA lives among health plans has grown markedly, particularly amid industry consolidation and the emergence of technology-enabled payors. This increasingly competitive environment requires health plans to offer differentiated benefits, a superior member experience and enhanced clinical outcomes while remaining cost efficient. As a result, health plans are increasingly relying on specialized third-party partners with sophisticated purpose-built technology to enhance benefit design, drive member engagement and manage core workflows. We believe our technology-enabled solutions and expert advisory services position us favorably to serve as a high value-add partner to our health plan clients.
•Growth and Prevalence of Supplemental Benefits: MA plans are rapidly adopting supplemental benefits as a mechanism to improve clinical outcomes and attract and retain new members. While over three million MA beneficiaries are currently enrolled in plans providing additional supplemental benefits to individuals with chronic illnesses, this figure only accounts for less than 12% of the total number of MA members in 2021. Due to the popularity of supplemental benefits among members and ability to improve clinical outcomes, we expect the prevalence and utilization of supplemental benefits to continue to increase.
•Shift to Value-Based Care (“VBC”): MA is the largest and most successful VBC program in existence today. In a new era focused on value-based reimbursement, the increased burden on both members and health plans to reduce costs has driven significant changes in the industry. In particular, the need for aligned benefit design, effective member management and broad ecosystem coordination, which typically fall outside of the core competencies of health plans, has driven health plans to outsource these core workflows to specialized third parties. Moreover, there is an increasing need for health plans to offer supplemental benefits to their members as the VBC environment promotes the importance of breaking down traditional physical and social barriers to help drive health outcomes. The heightened focus on leveraging technology-enabled solutions to lower costs, increase quality and compliance, and improve member satisfaction is a key industry trend that we believe we are well positioned to address.
•Compliance with Increasingly Complex and Evolving Regulatory Requirements: The government sector healthcare system imposes many regulations and processes that are manual, complex and constantly evolving. Health plans often lack the necessary infrastructure or resources to adapt quickly to changing requirements. The lack of 
specialized in-house solutions health plans have to maintain compliance with CMS regulations and requirements often results in foregone reimbursement and monetary penalties. In addition to monetary penalties, health plans risk facing suspension or revocation of their licenses to operate if they are not compliant with CMS regulations. Furthermore, we believe the regulatory environment will continue to grow more complex as the government-sponsored health plan market evolves. Therefore, the need for specialized solutions to help navigate the regulatory environment and facilitate compliance with ever-changing regulations and requirements is becoming increasingly paramount for health plans.
Market Opportunity
We serve as a specialized, solutions-oriented partner to our health plan clients and help manage their core operations. As such, our addressable markets are predicated on our clients’ supplemental benefit and administrative expenditures. For our core Medicare-focused offerings, we estimate our total immediately addressable market opportunity to consist of:
•$10 billion Market Opportunity in Our Existing Client Base with Our Current TES Solutions: We estimate this market opportunity by multiplying (1) the total number of MA and PDP members enrolled in our TES and Advisory clients’ plans as of December 31, 2021 by (2) our estimated average market rate on a per-member basis for the three core TES solutions we currently offer clients. We believe there is significant opportunity to grow our business by using our existing relationships to cross-sell our offerings to clients who do not currently use all of our core TES solutions.
•$1 billion Market Opportunity with New Clients in Existing MA and PDP Markets with Our Current TES Solutions: We estimate this additional market opportunity by multiplying (1) the total number of MA and PDP members not currently enrolled in our TES and Advisory clients' plans as of December 31, 2021 by (2) our estimated average market rate on a per-member basis for the three core TES solutions we currently offer clients.
We estimate that the broader addressable market opportunity for our core Medicare-focused offerings is approximately $77 billion, including our immediately addressable market opportunity described above, to consist of:
•$47 billion Market Opportunity in Supplemental Benefit Administration: We estimate this market opportunity by multiplying (1) the estimated number of total addressable long-term MA and PDP plan members as of December 31, 
2020 (the most recent information available from the Kaiser Family Foundation) by (2) the estimated average supplemental benefits administration figure on a per member per-month basis.
•$30 billion Market Opportunity in Plan Administration: We estimate this market opportunity by multiplying (1) the estimated number of total addressable long-term MA and PDP plan members as of December 31, 2020 (the most recent information available from the Kaiser Family Foundation) by (2) the estimated average plan administration expenditure on a per-member per-month basis.
•We believe the MA market is underpenetrated at present. As such, we calculate the estimated number of total addressable long-term MA plan members by multiplying (1) the total number of members eligible for Medicare in 2020 (the most recent information available from the Kaiser Family Foundation) by (2) the expected percentage of MA plan members of all Medicare members in 2030. 
The Medicare market continues to benefit from strong secular trends and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this large and growing market opportunity.
In addition, we also intend to grow our addressable market opportunity through expansion into adjacent markets, and believe our solutions and services address similar needs that exist across other government-sponsored and commercial programs. We continue to grow our presence in Managed Medicaid and believe this represents a natural adjacency to our core MA market. We estimate our total addressable market opportunity in Managed Medicaid to be approximately $21 billion. Moreover, we estimate our total addressable market opportunity in commercial insurance to be an additional $117 billion.
Value Proposition

Our omni-channel supplemental benefits management offering enables members to fully access these benefits to which they are entitled.
Our Differentiated Miramar Technology Platform
The backbone of our offerings is our proprietary technology platform, Miramar. We believe the following are key differentiators of our technology platform:
•Comprehensive, Purpose-Built Platform: Miramar is a comprehensive technology platform that reduces the need for health plans to maintain multiple systems and enables us to provide a seamless user experience for our clients and their members. We designed and developed Miramar specifically for the government health plan sector, as opposed to retrofitting a commercial insurance sector technology. We unify internal and external clinical and financial data to provide a differentiated member view that enables health plans to provide superior engagement and retention. Miramar enables us to replace and support a broad range of core systems for our health plan clients, with key workflows that can be modularized across product development and sales, member management, operations and support, all using a single platform. This contrasts with the multiple siloed systems that would need to be integrated and individually updated if conducted in-house by our clients. Miramar empowers our clients to consolidate steps and simplify functions that improve member experience, drive cost savings and enhance clinical outcomes. Through Miramar, our clients have access to a host of key plan administration features.
•Built to Scale: Miramar’s unified infrastructure enables us to rapidly deploy and scale new integrated solutions and services and has been a mainstay of our continued innovation. We have proven our ability to scale our technology to new clients and solutions as a result of having a repeatable and data-driven blueprint to expand our capabilities. Over the past three completed fiscal years, we have won and successfully implemented 45 new TES clients. With scale, our data assets provide even more powerful insights on our clients’ members, enabling us to create more streamlined experiences for members and positively impact outcomes. We have a track record of being able to implement and deploy solutions for large health plan clients, which we have made a repeatable playbook as we look to acquire new clients.
•Strong Interoperability with Broader Healthcare Ecosystem: We have built and continue to innovate technology infrastructure to support broad ecosystem integrations with key healthcare constituents, including health plans, employer groups, government entities, provider organizations, PBMs and financial institutions. Our direct integration and interoperability with the broader healthcare ecosystem enables us to ingest and harmonize data from disparate sources. Given the high volume, velocity and complexity of data our health plan clients must sort through, our offerings provide extensive operational support and allow us to serve as a valuable partner. Miramar processed over 3.1 billion automated transactions in 2021 through integrated processes across the healthcare ecosystem. In 2021, we also facilitated over 29 million touchpoints with members on behalf of our clients.
•Data & Analytics Capabilities: Leveraging our large proprietary datasets, we yield actionable insights through our Value-Based solution that resolve gaps in care and improve quality, data integrity and financial performance. Our value-based analytics capture data for over 35 million members. The ability to efficiently aggregate and process large 
scale data flows, which is ultimately utilized to guide clients’ operational strategies and decisions, has played a key role in scaling and managing large member populations, particularly in today’s complex and value-based care environment. We have a growing data asset that we believe will only become more impactful over time as we continue to connect insights with workflows to drive measurable outcome improvement for our clients.
The Impact of Our Platform and Solutions
Utilizing our technology-enabled solutions and advisory services, we administer and support a comprehensive range of mission-critical workflows on behalf of our clients across the following key areas:
•Product Development & Sales: Our technology solutions and services empower our health plan clients to deliver a differentiated health plan offering, which can result in higher membership growth and plan revenues. Using our advanced plan administration, supplemental benefits administration and advisory offerings, we enable a number of product development and commercialization initiatives for our clients including benefit design, plan selection, formulary development, go-to-market research, strategy and execution, and broker and sales agent credentialing.
•Member Engagement & Core Operations: We manage critical member engagement workflows directly on behalf of our clients. Using our advanced plan administration solution, we manage workflows across enrollment and eligibility, premium billing, financial reconciliation, and payment processing. Our technology solutions are designed to enhance operational capabilities for our health plan clients, allowing them to improve the member experience by offering members easy-to-navigate self service capabilities including web portals and mobile applications. In addition, our dedicated compliance and quality teams continually monitor the evolving regulatory environment. We provide solutions and services that enable our clients to better adhere to government regulations and internal compliance requirements. We also support our clients in their quality and CMS audit processes. We believe that we provide highly-compliant and market-leading solutions that successfully help our clients minimize compliance risk.
•Clinical Health Outcomes: Our SBA solutions help members navigate a range of benefits that have been tailored to address clinical, social, or physical needs and improve their overall health. Our solutions enhance member experience, improve health outcomes and create differentiation for MA plans. We help our clients solve unmet social needs that impact almost 40% of all Medicare beneficiaries. For example, the home delivery of OTC products through our SBA solutions alleviates challenges with member access to transportation, which is a significant SDOH. Studies have shown 
that on average every dollar spent by consumers on OTC medicines saves $6-7 for the U.S. healthcare system. Many of the SDOH-focused supplemental benefits are becoming key differentiators for MA plans and improve both health outcomes and member experience. Our platform was purpose-designed to allow us to add additional benefit categories as new and innovative benefits emerge, and we are currently building out our technology to support supplemental benefits beyond OTC.
•Business Intelligence & Analytics: Our Value-Based data platform, powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, seamlessly aggregates and organizes disparate clinical, claims and SDOH data to optimize revenue and profitability. Our data analytics platform, which is currently powered by over 35 million lives and over 100 proprietary data models, is designed to handle a growing volume and velocity of healthcare data. Value-based payments such as MA reimbursement require the submission of enrollment, claims and clinical data to determine revenue for the plan. Our revenue integrity solution focuses on the complete, accurate and compliant data collection, submission and acceptance of data to the government. Our value based payment assurance product identifies revenue being understated on average by over 1.3% for an MA plan. 
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, for an MA plan with 100,000 members, this translates into approximately $20 million in additional revenue to the health plan. We believe the depth and breadth of our growing data set and ability to embed into workflows will differentiate our solutions and improve outcomes for our clients. 
We have a demonstrated track record of delivering compelling clinical, financial and administrative outcomes for our clients. We believe our comprehensive solutions and services enable us to deliver results that exceed those achieved in-house by our clients, as well as by most other third-party partners. A time and motion study confirmed that our APA solutions reduced the time to complete an address change with potential disenrollment by 75% due to our ability to address the complexity of this task, which involves multiple systems and reporting, using our integrated approach. This study also showed our ability to reduce the time to complete a premium billing credit card transaction by 47% compared to the time when utilizing a leading competitor’s solution to address the same task. The result is higher quality and lower cost for the health plan, and higher member satisfaction.
Case Study: Advanced Plan Administration Platform Efficiencies Driving Improved Member and Client
Satisfaction
Case Study: OTC Offering Helps Lower Medical Costs 
During 2021, our Value-Based Analytics business provided some insights on beneficiaries of our SBA program. Analyzing over 250,000 OTC beneficiaries across a three-year period, we found a high correlation between usage of our OTC offering and lower medical costs. More specifically, users of our OTC program who had diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or a history of slip and fall accidents had between 6 and 8 percent lower medical costs than members with similar conditions who did not use our OTC offering.
Competitive Strengths
Comprehensive Payor Services Platform Based on Differentiated, Solutions-Oriented Partnership Model
We believe our success is predicated on our comprehensive capabilities and track record of fostering long-term collaborative partnerships with our clients. We have strategically developed our portfolio of technology-enabled solutions and advisory services to address our clients’ mission-critical workflows. We engage closely with our health plan clients to help them attract and retain members, improve revenue accuracy, drive cost savings, facilitate regulatory compliance, and enhance operational effectiveness. Moreover, our active dialogue with our clients through our advisory team enables us to easily identify new opportunities to deploy additional solutions and services. 
We serve as a solutions-oriented partner to the largest and most sophisticated clients, including nine of the top 10 MA payors in the U.S. We believe our unwavering commitment to delivering innovative and effective solutions for our clients, our comprehensive capabilities and domain expertise have earned us our reputation as a trusted partner to the nation’s largest payors. 
Purpose-Built, Scalable and Integrated Technology and Analytics Platform 
We believe our proprietary technology, rich dataset and advanced applied analytics capabilities enable us to deliver meaningful value as a partner to our health plan clients, members and partner constituents. Our Miramar technology platform enables us to provide a seamless, unified user experience for our clients and their members. Miramar’s unified infrastructure enables us to rapidly deploy and scale new integrated solutions and services and has been a mainstay of our continued innovation. Miramar supports broad ecosystem integrations with health plans, employers groups, government bodies, provider organizations, PBMs and financial institutions, which enables us to ingest and harmonize data from multiple sources. Our Value-Based solutions integrate disparate clinical, claims and SDOH data and utilize sophisticated applied analytics to help our clients optimize value-based revenue and payment integrity. Our purpose-built solutions allow us to help our clients navigate the constantly evolving regulatory environment and more efficiently engage their members.
Attractive Operating Model with Contractually Recurring Revenues and High Financial Visibility
As of December 31, 2021, we had 169 clients that purchased our solutions and services. Our solutions managed over 3.5 million MA members and 1.6 million PDP members. Additionally, our value-based analytics, which are powered by our 35 million member data set, provided actionable insights for nearly 7.3 million MA members in 2021. The significant increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 in the number of MA members we provided actionable insights for was the result of contracting with new clients. As the MA payor market is relatively concentrated, we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our total revenue from a limited number of key clients. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our two largest clients, when aggregating all the solutions and services utilized by such clients across separate contracts with multiple product delivery solutions, represented 27.8% and 18.9% of our total revenue, respectively, or collectively 46.7% of our total revenue during this period. Our two largest clients are two of the top 10 MA payors in the U.S. While we have client concentration, our longest client relationships are among our two largest clients at 16 years and 10 years as of December 31, 2021, respectively, and we generally have long-term contracts with our other clients as well. In addition, we have many different contractual relationships with, and provide many different solutions to, each of our top clients. The multiple solutions we provide to our clients, the length of our contracts and the established long-term relationships we have developed with our top clients reduces the overall risk of concentration to our business.
We have generated a substantial portion of our revenue from clients on a recurring or re-occurring fee basis, which, coupled with our multi-year contracts and historically high client revenue retention, have provided high revenue predictability and visibility. We focus on maintaining longstanding relationships with our clients and serve as a strategic partner across mission-critical workflows. We believe our focus on collaborative innovation with our clients, in conjunction with the expansive set of mission-critical solutions and services we provide, results in a highly loyal client base as evidenced by our GDR of 99%, 98%, and 99% in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. Our high client retention, as measured on a revenue retention basis, demonstrates the predictability of our revenue and that our solutions are deeply embedded in our clients’ core operations. Our NDR was 117%, 135%, and 142% in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively, exhibiting the strength of our platform and growth of our existing client base. Figures for 2019 are based on the Successor period from June 13, 2019 to December 2019 and the Predecessor period from January 1, 2019 to September 3, 2019.
Unmatched Expertise and Breadth of Solutions for Government-Sponsored Health Plans
Based, in part, on our extensive experience and history working with many of the nation’s largest payors, we believe we have unmatched expertise and an established leadership position in government plan administration. Our TES solutions and Advisory services position us at the forefront of emerging trends across payor strategies. We believe our platform, which embodies years of research, innovation, iterations and enhancements, is a leading platform for the administration of government plans demonstrated by the fact that we serve nine of the top 10 MA payors in the U.S. Our comprehensive capabilities, extensive healthcare ecosystem integrations and highly specialized expertise in the complex government health plan market enable us to deliver innovative solutions and superior clinical, operational, compliance and financial outcomes for our clients.
Outstanding Management and Advisory Team with Proven Track Record of Success
Our long-tenured executive leadership team has extensive experience across the healthcare, technology and consulting sectors and has delivered a strong compound annual growth rate in revenue from continuing operations since 2011. Our CEO and CFO have a combined experience of over 28 years with Convey Health as of December 31, 2021, and extensive experience managing publicly traded companies. Our executive officers have on average 23 years of experience with the government health plan market as of December 31, 2021. We approach the market competitively and believe that we win, in part, because of our commitment to dedicate the resources required to accomplish the goals of our clients. We believe that our Advisory team brings us closer to the market so that we remain at the forefront of trends and drive further innovation in the market. As a result of this powerful combination of services and technology, we believe that we have a strong competitive position and can adapt more rapidly to any changing conditions. Further, we believe that our innovative combination of technology and advisory expertise has transformed Convey Health into the preeminent payor solutions platform.
Growth Strategy
Cross-Sell and Upsell Existing Solutions
Our technology-enabled solutions expand regularly, and our clients often utilize more solutions over time. The flexibility of our platform and our consultative approach allow us to cross-sell more products and solutions to existing clients and expand our share of wallet with the nation’s top health plans. We also benefit from plan membership growth within existing clients, many of which are growing and gaining market share.
We believe we have significant remaining opportunity to continue our growth within our existing client base. For example, approximately 60% of our TES client base uses only one of our three core technology enabled solutions as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, approximately 46% of our clients use only Advisory services as of December 31, 2021, and currently utilize none of our TES solutions. Consequently, we believe our existing client base continues to be a significant channel in which to sell both our existing technologies and any additional solutions or services.
Expand Existing Solutions and Introduce New Solutions
Our clients are increasingly looking to simplify their offerings and we expect to extend our technology offering to allow Miramar to be a single portal for multiple supplemental benefits. This could entail offerings and support for food and grocery, meals, transportation, in-home services, hearing, vision, and dental which are all gaining in popularity. As more supplemental benefits are designed to address SDOH, we believe our solutions will help drive improved health outcomes. We also see Managed Medicaid and the commercial insurance market as adjacent opportunities.
In particular, we believe our supplemental benefits offering will continue to expand due to growing prevalence of plans offering supplemental benefits, increasing member enrollment trends in such benefits, rising spend allocated to supplemental benefits, and increasing member utilization of such benefits. Further, our clients are increasingly looking to expand their offerings with leading third party platforms, and we continue to extend our technology offering to allow Miramar to be a single portal for multiple supplemental benefits.
There are several additional technology solutions that we are considering strategically, including, but not limited to, clinical management, member marketing, member acquisition, provider data and network management, claims administration, health risk assessments, home health, and SDOH. In addition, we believe our domain expertise from Advisory accelerates our technology development and allows us to develop leading solutions. We have a successful history of growing our solutions and services through internal innovation and will continue to actively invest in expanding our platform capabilities.
Win New Technology Clients
Our technology platform serves large national and regional health plans as well as PBMs. We believe we have a significant opportunity to sell technology solutions, as approximately 46% of our clients use only Advisory services as of December 31, 2021, and currently utilize none of our TES solutions. In addition, 53% of insurance carriers that offer MA plans as of December 31, 2021, are not our clients. Over time, we expect to leverage our Advisory relationships to implement technology solutions to address their needs. Our reputation as a long-term strategic partner, combined with our comprehensive solutions set and specialized market expertise, has enabled us to win 45 new TES clients since 2017. Given the increasing importance health plans are placing on growing their MA business, we believe we are well positioned to demonstrate value at multiple touchpoints to align to their business objectives.
Targeted Expansion in New Markets
We are continuously evaluating new markets to deploy our broad set of solutions. We have identified Managed Medicaid, commercial health insurance payors, and risk-bearing providers as adjacent markets that we believe are good candidates for our TES solutions. Our Value-Based solutions have already been deployed to several risk-bearing providers.
Strategic and Highly Disciplined Acquisitions
We have a demonstrated history of continuously expanding our relationships with clients through the addition of new solutions to our platform, both organically and through acquisitions. This includes the successful acquisition and integration of Gorman Health Group, HealthScape Advisors, LLC (“HealthScape Advisors”) and Pareto Intelligence, LLC (“Pareto Intelligence”). We also recently acquired HealthSmart International and intend to leverage its product development and supply chain expertise to introduce additional products and technologies to enhance the health at home benefit for MA members. Our differentiated partnership model and collaborative approach enable us to gain critical insights into our clients’ evolving needs. We intend to complement our internal innovation and strong organic growth opportunities with acquisitions of complementary technology solutions and services to continue to better serve our clients. Potential targets could include, among others, companies that would further strengthen our platform and technologies in clinical management, member marketing, provider data and network management, claims administration, as well as expansion of supplemental benefits management.
Sales and Marketing
We sell and market our solutions in three primary ways:
•cross-sales to existing clients utilizing our TES solutions;
•selling TES solutions to clients served by our Advisory Services offerings; and
•sales to new clients.
Our Advisory team is critical to identifying opportunities where our existing clients can utilize our TES solutions, as their extensive executive level relationships provide critical insights into our clients’ strategic initiatives. We benefit significantly from the subject matter expertise, market credibility, thought leadership and relationships our executives and advisory team have within our industry and referrals from existing clients. While our sales and client service representatives are responsible for lead generation, they are primarily dedicated to the cross-selling and upselling of our solutions to existing clients. We deploy marketing strategies centered on initiatives that drive awareness of our company and our solutions in order to reach new customers. These initiatives include targeted direct marketing, advertising, trade show participation, workshops, web-based marketing activities, e-newsletters and customer and industry conferences.
Our Clients
Our clients consist primarily of health plans, specialty health companies and to a lesser degree providers. As of December 31, 2021, we served 169 clients, including nine of the nation’s top 10 health plans. Our two largest clients are two of the top 10 MA payors in the U.S. As of December 31, 2021, we served 36 of the top 50 MA and PDP plans.
We believe we serve as a trusted, solutions-oriented partner to our clients and foster long-term, collaborative relationships, with our average relationship for our top 10 clients of over eight years as of December 31, 2021. Revenue from our top 10 clients accounted for 75%, 77%, and 72% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, our two largest clients, Cigna Corporate Services and United HealthCare Services, when aggregating all the solutions and services utilized by such clients across separate contracts with multiple product delivery solutions, represented 27.8%, and 18.9% of our total revenue, respectively, or collectively 46.7% of our total revenue during this period. As the MA payor market is relatively concentrated, we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our total revenue from a limited number of key clients. See “Risk Factors — Our client base is highly concentrated and we currently depend on a small number of clients for a substantial portion of our total revenue, and this concentration exposes us disproportionately to effects from altered contracts with these clients.” While our client base is concentrated, we have multiple contractual relationships with our largest clients covering multiple product delivery solutions. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we achieved 117%, 135%, and 142% NDR of our total client base, respectively. Figures for 2019 are based on the Successor period from June 13, 2019 to December 2019 and the Predecessor period from January 1, 2019 to September 3, 2019.
Government Regulation
Substantially all of our business is directly or indirectly related to the healthcare industry and is affected by changes in the healthcare industry, including regulatory changes and fluctuations in healthcare spending. In the United States, the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequently changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Participants in the healthcare industry, including our customers, are required to comply with extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations, including those issued by CMS and other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), as well as other laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse, false claims, anti-kickback and privacy and data security laws and regulations. Although some laws and regulations do not directly apply to our business, these laws and regulations affect the business of our customers and in turn can affect the demand for our solutions.
Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D
Medicare
Medicare is a federal program administered by CMS through various contractors. Available to individuals age 65 and over, and certain other individuals, the Medicare program provides, among other things, healthcare benefits that cover, subject to limitations, the major costs of most medically necessary care for such individuals, subject to certain deductibles and copayments.
CMS has established guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain products and procedures by Medicare. In general, to be reimbursed by Medicare, a healthcare procedure furnished to a Medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. The methodology for determining coverage status and the amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary received healthcare products and services. Medicare is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, intermediary determinations, and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease the rate of 
program payments to healthcare providers. Any such changes in federal legislation, regulations and policy affecting the entities with which we contract could have a material effect on our performance and revenue generation.
Medicare Advantage
Under the Medicare Advantage program, also known as Medicare Part C, the federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. MA plans can be structured as Health Maintenance Organizations, Preferred Provider Organizations or private fee-for-service plans. In addition to covering Part A and Part B benefits, the health insurers may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and plan costs on beneficiaries. Medicare beneficiaries that choose to participate in MA choose which health plan through which to receive their Medicare coverage. To assist beneficiaries with plan selection, CMS established a five-star quality rating system. Using this system, CMS publishes Star Ratings based on a variety of quality, patient satisfaction and performance measures for health plans on an annual basis. These ratings are based on data gathered from a variety of sources, including the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems program, the Medicare Health Outcome Survey, the Medicare Prescription Drug Program and CMS administrative data. CMS generally pays health insurance plans that participate in MA on a per capita basis. CMS makes certain adjustments based on service benchmarks and quality ratings.
Medicare Part D
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
In the United States, federal and state legislatures and agencies periodically consider healthcare reform measures that may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare participants operate, including our customers. Our business could be affected by changes in healthcare laws, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which was signed into law in March 2010. The ACA has changed how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced Medicare program spending and insurance market reforms. The ACA has created major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed and generally increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States. Among other things, the ACA has increased the number of individuals with Medicaid and private insurance coverage, implemented reimbursement policies that tie payment to quality, facilitated the creation of accountable care organizations that may use capitation and other alternative payment methodologies, strengthened enforcement of fraud abuse laws and encouraged the use of information technology. While provisions of the ACA are not directly applicable to our business, the ACA affects the business of our customers, which may in turn affect our business.
HIPAA and other Health Information Laws
A significant portion of our business is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). Among other things, HIPAA requires business associates and covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements relating to protected health information and personally identifiable information and mandates the way certain types of healthcare services are coded and processed. We frequently act as a business associate to our covered entity clients and, as a result, collect, use, disclose and maintain the protected health information and personally identifiable information of individuals, as well as other financial, confidential and other proprietary information belonging to our customers and certain third parties from whom we obtain information (e.g., private insurance companies and financial institutions). HIPAA and other state laws and regulations and industry standards require us to establish and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of electronic protected health information, which also includes information about the payment for healthcare services, as well as 
payment card data under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. These laws, regulations and standards, and the rules promulgated thereunder, are changed frequently by legislation, regulatory issuances or administrative interpretation. For instance, in January 2013, HHS issued the Omnibus Final Rule modifying and supplementing many of the standards and regulations under HIPAA. The Omnibus Final Rule significantly lowered the disclosure standards required for notifications of breaches in patient privacy and expanded the universe of available liability under certain of HIPAA’s requirements, including expanding direct liability for HIPAA’s requirements to companies such as ours, which act as business associates to covered entities.
HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and requires the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form, as well as breach notification procedures for breaches of protected health information and penalties for violation of HIPAA’s requirements for entities subject to its regulation. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations mandate format and data content standards and provider identifier standards (known as the National Provider Identifier) that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as eligibility inquiries, and enforcement of compliance with these standards falls under HHS and is carried out by CMS. Violations of HIPAA’s requirements may result in civil and criminal penalties, which may be significant. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing individuals’ health information. HHS is currently conducting audits of covered entities and business associates to assess their HIPAA compliance, and we may be subject to such an audit in our capacity as a business associate to our covered entity clients.
In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal and state laws govern the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of protected health information and personally identifiable information, and these laws can be more restrictive than HIPAA, which means that entities subject to them must comply with the more restrictive state law in addition to complying with HIPAA. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some state laws, unlike HIPAA, also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. State laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject. We cannot predict how future federal or state privacy or similar laws and regulations may affect us or our customers. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting our business related to compliance with HIPAA and other federal and state laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Governmental Regulation — We are subject to complex, stringent and evolving laws, regulations and standards relating to data privacy and security (including the collection, storage, use, transfer, and processing of personally identifiable information), including protected health information, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws, regulations or standards, or our own information security policies or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security, could adversely affect our business, including our reputation among clients.”
Communications Laws
In addition, the United States regulates marketing and certain other communications by telephone and email, and individual states also impose restrictions on telephone marketing. The laws and regulations governing the use of emails and telephone calls for such purposes continue to evolve, and changes in technology, the marketplace or consumer preferences may lead to the adoption of additional laws or regulations or changes in interpretation of existing laws or regulations. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act, as amended (“TCPA”) and other federal and state laws prohibit companies from making telemarketing calls to numbers listed in the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry and impose other obligations and limitations on contacting our customers and our customers’ members. The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (“CAN-SPAM Act”) regulates commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that do not comply with certain requirements, such as providing an opt-out mechanism for stopping future emails from senders. We are required to comply with these and similar laws, regulations and other requirements.
For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting our business related to compliance with federal, state and other laws and regulations and other requirements, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Governmental Regulation — Recent and future developments in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Governmental Regulation — We are unable to predict what changes to laws, regulations and other requirements, including related to contractual obligations, might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business and the costs of compliance.” 
Intellectual Property
We rely upon a combination of trade secret, trademark, patent and copyright laws, license agreements, confidentiality policies and procedures, contractual provisions (e.g., intellectual property assignment agreements), nondisclosure agreements and technical measures of varying duration designed to establish, maintain and protect the intellectual property and other proprietary information and commercially valuable confidential information and data used in our business. We have registered or applied to register certain of our trademarks in the United States. We also license intellectual property and technology from third parties, including some that is incorporated into our solutions. 
For example, with respect to the Miramar technology platform, which was internally-developed by the Company, the Company owns all right, title and interest in the copyrightable expression embodied in the source code for Miramar, the source code for Miramar is a trade secret of the Company, and the Company has obtained trademark protection for various products and features included in the Miramar platform. 
We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other intellectual property, including the source code for Miramar, through the use of internal and external controls, including entering into nondisclosure, confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees and third parties.
The steps we have taken to protect our trade secrets, trademarks, patents and other intellectual property and proprietary information may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse our intellectual property. If this were to occur, it could harm our reputation and adversely affect our competitive position, business, results of operation or financial condition.
For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting our business related to our protection of intellectual property and other proprietary information, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual Property — The protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights requires substantial resources, and protections of our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequate. Any failure to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights, or failure of our intellectual property and proprietary rights to be sufficiently broad, could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.”
Competition
We compete primarily with healthcare services and technology companies. We also compete in some cases with certain of our customers who themselves provide some of the same solutions that we offer or who may decide to perform internally some of the same solutions that we provide. In addition, certain major software, hardware, information systems and business process outsourcing companies, both with and without healthcare companies as their partners, may seek to offer competitive software and services.
Our TES solutions compete with:
•healthcare information system vendors that support providers or payors in their administration of MA (including the administration of supplemental benefits), Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan and Employer Group Waiver Plans;
•healthcare insurance companies, pharmacy benefit management and pharmacy benefit administrator companies, hospital management companies and pharmacies that provide or are developing electronic transaction and payment distribution services for use by providers or by their members and customers;
•healthcare payments and communication solutions providers, including financial institutions and payment processors that have invested in healthcare data management assets; and
•healthcare payment accuracy companies, and providers of other data products and data analytics solutions, including healthcare risk adjustment, quality, economic statistics and other data, and analytics solutions.
Our Advisory Services offerings compete with:
•National management consulting firms (including, but not limited to, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, Accenture plc, McKinsey & Company and other similar firms);
•Boutique consulting firms; and
•Internal consulting departments within our clients.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,800 full-time employees, including approximately 550 full-time employees hired on a temporary basis in connection with seasonal volume increases and approximately 290 part-time 
employees and independent contractors. All of our employees and independent contractors are located in the United States except for approximately 340 individuals who were located in the Philippines as of December 31, 2021. We experience seasonal employee hiring practices primarily from September through December in connection with the Medicare annual enrollment period, which typically results in the hiring of a significant number of full-time employees on a temporary basis. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash based performance bonus awards.
