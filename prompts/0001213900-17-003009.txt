Summary
 
ImmuCell Corporation was founded in 1982 and completed an initial public offering of common stock in 1987. After achieving approval from the Center for Veterinary Biologics, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell First Defense® in 1991, we focused most of our efforts during the 1990’s developing human product applications of the underlying milk protein purification technology. Beginning in 1999, we re-focused our business strategy on First Defense® and other products that improve animal health and productivity in the dairy and beef industries. We aim to capitalize on the growth in sales of First Defense® (a product that provides significant immediate immunity to newborn dairy and beef livestock) and to revolutionize the mastitis treatment paradigm (with a product we are developing to treat this most significant cause of economic loss to the dairy industry).
 
During 2000, we began the development of Mast Out®, our Nisin-based treatment for subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows. No sales of this product can be made without prior approval of our New Animal Drug Application (NADA) by the Center for Veterinary Medicine, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Regulatory achievements to date have significantly reduced the product development risks in the areas of safety and effectiveness. Our primary product development focus has now turned to the manufacturing objectives required for FDA approval.

Since 2006, we have made ongoing efforts to maintain compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations in all of our manufacturing operations, which requires a sustained investment that further enhances the quality of all of our products. As we make process improvements, we continue to invest in personnel, equipment and facility modifications to increase the efficiency and quality of our operations.
 
We had approximately 2,429,000 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 1998 (at the time we focused our strategy on products for the dairy and beef industries) in comparison to approximately 4,847,000 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2016. There were approximately 480,000 and 251,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under stock options that were outstanding as of December 31, 1998 and 2016, respectively. During 2016, we issued an aggregate of 1,783,690 shares of common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $9,364,000 in two separate transactions. In order to minimize the dilutive effects of such transactions on our existing stockholders, we chose not to issue any form of convertible or preferred securities and issued these common shares without any warrants. We also raised up to approximately $6.5 million in new debt availability (during the first quarter of 2016 and amended during the first quarter of 2017). We intend to use this new capital to complete the development of Mast Out® without relying on funding from a partner, thereby retaining control over all product rights and potential revenues.
 
Our operations are generally profitable, except when we elect to make unusually large investments in product development expenses. During these eighteen years in which we have focused on products for the dairy and beef industries, we have funded our operations and improved our net financial position, as demonstrated in the following table (in thousands, except for percentages):

Animal Health Products
 
Our lead product, First Defense®, is manufactured from hyperimmune cows’ colostrum (the milk that a cow produces immediately after giving birth) utilizing our proprietary vaccine and milk protein purification technologies. The target disease, bovine enteritis (calf scours), causes diarrhea and dehydration in newborn calves and often leads to serious sickness and even death. First Defense® is the only USDA-licensed, orally delivered scours preventive product on the market for calves with claims against E. coli K99 and coronavirus (two leading causes of scours). We are working to add a third claim (rotavirus) to our product line during 2017. First Defense® provides bovine antibodies that newborn calves need but are unable to produce on their own immediately after birth. Our milk antibody products provide Immediate Immunity™ during the first few critical days of life when calves need this protection most. Studies have shown that calves that scour are more susceptible to other diseases later in life and under-perform calves that do not contract scours. The direct, two-part mode-of-action of First Defense® delivers specific immunoglobulins at the gut level to immediately protect against disease, while also providing additional antibodies that are absorbed into the bloodstream. These circulating antibodies function like a natural timed-release mechanism, as they are re-secreted into the gut later to provide extended protection. A single dose of First Defense® provides a guaranteed level of protection proven to reduce mortality and morbidity from two major causes of calf scours. First Defense® is convenient to use. A calf needs to receive only one bolus of First Defense® within the first twelve hours after birth (the earlier the better). The product is stored at room temperature and no mixing is required before it is given to the calf. We are a leader in the scours prevention market with this product. The third quarter of 2016 marked the 25th anniversary of the original USDA approval of this product in 1991. During the third quarter of 2016, we sold the 18,000,000th dose of First Defense®. We believe that these milestones demonstrate the value of our technology and the long-term market acceptance of our product. In 2011, we began selling nutritional and feed supplement product applications (that are not delivered in the capsule format) of our First Defense Technology®, which is a unique whey protein concentrate that is purified utilizing our proprietary milk protein processing methods that does not carry the claims of our USDA-licensed product. We are working to add USDA claims to these product formats. We utilize one liquid processing production line and two filling and formulating production lines and one quality system for all of our milk-based products.

During 1999, we acquired Wipe Out® Dairy Wipes, which has been our second leading source of product sales. Wipe Out® Dairy Wipes consist of towelettes that are pre-moistened with a Nisin-based formulation to prepare the teat area of a cow in advance of milking. Wipe Out® Dairy Wipes were manufactured in compliance with cGMP regulations, as required by federal law. As a product line extension, we developed a pet application of the Nisin technology underlying Wipe Out® Dairy Wipes, since many skin infections in pets are caused by Nisin-susceptible bacteria. During the first quarter of 2017 based on an extensive review of this product line, we discontinued the production and sale of the topical wipes product line due to its limited sales growth potential and minimal contribution to profits.
 
During 2001, we began to offer our own, internally developed California Mastitis Test (CMT). CMT can be used for bulk tank as well as individual cow sample monitoring and can be used to determine which quarter of the udder is mastitic. This test can be performed at cow-side for early detection of mastitis. CMT products are also made by other manufacturers and are readily available to the dairy producer.
 
In connection with our acquisition of certain gel formulation technologies during the first quarter of 2016, we also acquired certain products that we now produce and sell under private label relationships with Ridley, USA Inc. of Mankato, MN and Genex Cooperative Inc. of Shawano, WI.
 
Sales and Markets
 
Our sales and marketing team currently consists of one vice president, five regional managers and one inside sales and marketing employee. The manner in which we sell and distribute our products depends, in large measure, upon the nature of the particular product, its intended users and the country in which it is sold. First Defense® and CMT are sold primarily through major animal health distributors who, in turn, sell directly to veterinary clinics, fleet stores and direct to farms. We have experienced minimal bad debt with respect to these products. Promotional merchandise is given to certain customers at times because we believe it enhances brand recognition. Additionally, advertising, training meetings, incentive programs, direct mail initiatives and face-to-face solution selling are tactics we use to create brand loyalty. Sales of First Defense® are normally seasonal, with higher sales expected during the first quarter. Sales of this product into the beef industry are highly seasonal because most beef calves are born between January and April each year. Harsh winter weather and severe temperature fluctuations cause stress to calves, and calves under stress are more susceptible to scours. We sold Wipe Out® Dairy Wipes to distributors, bovine veterinarians and directly to producers.
 
International product sales represented approximately 13% and 16% of our total product sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of these international sales were to Canada. We currently price our products in U.S. dollars. To the extent that the value of the dollar declines with respect to any other currency, our competitive position may be enhanced. Conversely, an increase in the value of the dollar in any country in which we sell products may have the effect of increasing the local price of our products, thereby leading to a potential reduction in demand. The value of the Canadian dollar has declined recently, but this has not correlated with a decrease in our sales into Canada. Generally, our international sales are generated through relationships with in-country distributors that have knowledge of the local regulatory and marketing requirements. We continue our efforts to grow sales of First Defense® in North America, where there are approximately 40,200,000 dairy and beef cows in the United States and 4,795,000 dairy and beef cows in Canada. We believe that even greater market opportunities exist in other international territories. There are estimated to be approximately 67,000,000 dairy and beef cows in China, 35,850,000 in the European Union, 20,306,000 in Australia and New Zealand, 10,175,000 in Mexico, 1,344,000 in South Korea and 1,340,000 in Japan. However, industry practices, economic conditions, cause of disease, distribution channels and regulatory requirements may differ in these international markets from what we experience in North America.

We introduced First Defense® into South Korea in 2005 through Medexx Co., Ltd of Gyeonggi-do, Korea and its equivalent into Japan in 2007 through NYS Co., Ltd of Iwate, Japan. We entered into a distribution agreement with Beijing Starbiopharm Inc. of Beijing, China covering China during 2014. We entered into distribution contracts covering certain Middle Eastern countries with Triplest for Drugs and Trade of Madaba, Jordan during the first quarter of 2017 and covering Iran with Senikco, LLC of Laguna Niguel, CA during the fourth quarter of 2016.
 
With Mast Out®, we are working to expand our product offerings to include an intramammary treatment for subclinical mastitis for the mother cow during lactation. Mastitis (inflammation of the mammary gland) is the most costly and common disease affecting the dairy industry. It is estimated to cost the U.S. dairy industry approximately $2 billion in economic harm per year. The disease diminishes the saleable quantity and overall value of milk, in addition to causing other herd health and productivity losses. While the benefit of treating clinical mastitis is widely known, subclinical mastitis (those cases where cows have infected udders, but still produce saleable milk) is associated with its own significant economic losses and is recognized as a substantial contributor to clinical mastitis cases. There is a growing awareness of the cascade of adverse events and conditions associated with subclinical mastitis, including reduced or foregone milk quality premiums, lower milk production, shorter shelf life for fluid milk, lower yields and less flavor for cheese, higher rates of clinical mastitis, lower conception rates, increased abortions and increased cull rates. Some industry experts have estimated that subclinical mastitis costs the U.S. dairy industry approximately $1 billion per year. Our active ingredient, Nisin, is an antibacterial peptide that has been demonstrated in clinical studies to be an effective aid in the reduction of mastitis-causing organisms in dairy cows. We believe that Mast Out® could revolutionize the way that mastitis is treated by making earlier treatment of subclinically infected cows economically feasible by not requiring a milk discard during, or for a period of time after, treatment which would be a significant competitive advantage for our product. No other FDA-approved mastitis treatment product on the market can offer this value proposition. Because the milk from cows treated with traditional antibiotics must be discarded, most dairy producers simply do not treat subclinically infected cows. It is generally current practice to treat mastitis only when the disease has progressed to the clinical stage where the milk from an infected cow cannot be sold. Common milk discard periods cover the duration of treatment and extend from 36 to 96 hours after last treatment, depending on the antibiotic. On average, a cow produces approximately 60 to 80 pounds of milk per day. While milk prices vary significantly, at an average value of $15.00 per 100 pounds, a cow produces approximately $9 to $12 worth of milk per day. These estimated figures would result in milk discard costs ranging from approximately $32 (for 3.5 days of milk at 60 pounds per day) to $132 (for 11 days of milk at 80 pounds per day) per treated animal, which is a significant barrier to the routine treatment of subclinical mastitis with traditional antibiotics. We have estimated that the approximate cost to the U.S. dairy industry of this discarded milk may be around $300 million per year. Subclinical mastitis is associated with reduced milk production (some have estimated approximately 1,500 pounds of lost milk, or about $240 at $16.00 per hundredweight, per infected cow), reduced milk premiums, reproduction inefficiencies and an increased incidence of clinical mastitis. The ability to treat such cases without a milk discard could revolutionize the way mastitis is managed in a herd. It is common practice to move sick cows from their regular herd group to a sick cow group for treatment and the related milk discard. This movement causes stress on the cow and a reduction in milk production. Cows treated with Mast Out® would not have to be moved, allowing this costly drop in production to be avoided. Mast Out® likely will be priced at a premium to the traditional antibiotic products currently on the market, which are all sold subject to a milk discard requirement. We believe that the product’s value proposition demonstrates a return on investment to the producer that will justify this premium.
 
The USDA’s National Animal Health Monitoring System through its Dairy 2014 study suggests that 21% of all dairy cows are treated with a mastitis drug, of which approximately 51% are treated with third generation cephalosporins. Many fear that the possible overuse of antibiotics in livestock undermines the effectiveness of drugs to combat human illnesses and contributes to a rising number of life-threatening human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria, commonly known as “superbugs”. The FDA is committed to addressing this public health risk. Citing concerns about untreatable, life-threatening infections in humans, new FDA and European regulations are aimed at restricting the use of antibiotics (including cephalosporins) in food animals and at improving milk quality. Regulators have recently increased their monitoring of antibiotic residues in milk and meat. During the first quarter of 2012, the USDA reduced the allowable level of somatic cell counts (SCC) in milk from 750,000 (cells per milliliter) to 400,000 at the individual farm level (not a blended calculation of comingled milk) in order to qualify for an EU health certification for export.

The FDA’s Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) became effective January 1, 2017 restricting the use of medically important antibiotics for performance purposes and requiring more oversight of antibiotic usage in food producing animals by a veterinarian, and more changes and restrictions are likely. Several major food processors and retailers have implemented policies addressing this growing public health concern. By reducing the risk of antibiotic residues and slowing the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms, we can improve food quality and preserve medically important antibiotics for human disease treatment. This would not be a concern for Mast Out® because Nisin is not used for human health. This current environment could be favorable to the introduction of a new product such as Mast Out® as an alternative to traditional antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporins. We believe that this changing environment of new regulations and public opinion supports the value of our ongoing product development efforts. Additionally, we believe that the use of First Defense® is consistent with this trend of reducing the use of antibiotics because the prevention of calf scours early in life with our purified milk antibodies can reduce the need for treatment antibiotics later in a calf’s life.
 
It is difficult to estimate the potential size of the market for the treatment of subclinical mastitis because this disease is largely left untreated presently. We believe that approximately 20-30% of the U.S. dairy herd is affected by subclinical mastitis caused by Gram-positive organisms falling within the Mast Out® claim spectrum. This compares to approximately 2% of the U.S. herd that is thought to be infected with clinical mastitis, where approximately $60 million per year is spent on drug treatments. We have estimated that first year domestic sales of our product could be approximately $5.8 million and that annual sales could grow to approximately $36.1 million by the fifth year after market launch. Actual sales results could be higher or lower. Key assumptions underlying these estimates include there being 7.65 million cows in lactation in the United States and the treatment of 1.15 quarters per cow on average with three doses per treatment at approximately $9.99 per dose. We assumed that 2.2% of all cows in lactation would be treated during the first year after market launch and that 13.7% would be treated during the fifth year after market launch. We believe that similar market opportunities also exist outside of the United States and for the treatment of dry (non-lactating) cows. The manufacturing facility that we are constructing could have enough capacity to meet approximately $13 million of the sales projected for the second or third year after product launch. Our construction plans allow for additional equipment to be installed in this facility in future years, which (when considered with anticipated yield improvements) could more than double the initial production capacity. This incremental investment would only be made after market acceptance of the product is demonstrated.
 
Product Development
 
The majority of our product development spending is focused on the development of Mast Out®. During the seventeen-year period that began on January 1, 2000 (the year we began the development of Mast Out®) and ended on December 31, 2016, we invested the aggregate of approximately $12,409,000 in the development of Mast Out®. This estimated allocation to Mast Out® reflects only direct expenditures and includes no allocation of product development or administrative overhead expenses. Approximately $2,891,000 of this investment was offset by product licensing revenues and grant income related to Mast Out®, most of which was earned from 2001 to 2007.
 
During 2000, we acquired an exclusive license from Nutrition 21, Inc. (formerly Applied Microbiology Inc. or AMBI) to develop and market Nisin-based products for animal health applications, which allowed us to initiate the development of Mast Out®. In 2004, we paid Nutrition 21 approximately $965,000 to buy out this royalty and milestone-based license to Nisin, thereby acquiring control of the animal health applications of Nisin. Nisin, is an antibacterial peptide known to be effective against most Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. We have more than fifteen years of experience manufacturing Nisin for our now discontinued topical wipes product line. In our pivotal effectiveness study, statistically significant Mast Out® cure rates were associated with a statistically significant reduction in milk somatic cell count, which is an important measure of milk quality. Nisin is a well characterized substance, having been used in food preservation applications for over 50 years. Food-grade Nisin, however, cannot be used in pharmaceutical applications because of its low purity. Our Nisin technology includes processing and purification methods to achieve pharmaceutical-grade purity.

In 2004, we entered into a product development and marketing agreement with Pfizer Animal Health (now known as Zoetis) covering Mast Out®. Zoetis elected to terminate the agreement in 2007. We believe that this decision was not based on any unanticipated efficacy or regulatory issues. Rather, we believe the decision was primarily driven by a marketing concern relating to their fear that the milk from treated cows could interfere with the manufacture of certain cultured dairy products. Due to the zero milk discard feature, there is a risk that Nisin from the milk of cows treated with Mast Out® could interfere with the manufacture of certain (but not all) commercial cultured dairy products, such as some kinds of cheese and yogurt, if a process tank contains a high enough percentage of milk from treated cows. The impact of this potential interference ranges from a delay in the manufacturing process, which does happen at times for other reasons, to the less likely stopping of a cheese starter culture. Milk from cows that have been treated with Mast Out® that is sold exclusively for fluid milk products presents no such risk. We worked with scientists and mastitis experts to conduct a formal risk assessment to quantify the impact that milk from treated cows may have on cultured dairy products. This study concluded that the dilution of milk from treated cows through comingling with milk from untreated cows during normal milk hauling and storage practices reduces the risk of interference with commercial dairy cultures to a negligible level when Mast Out® is used in accordance with the product label. We do not believe that a premium-priced product such as Mast Out® will be used as part of a whole herd (“blitz”) treatment protocol, which reduces the risk of cheese interference. We do not see this as a significant problem as modern “precision dairying” practices support reducing the indiscriminate use of drug treatments.
 
Commercial introduction of Mast Out® in the United States is subject to approval of our New Animal Drug Application (NADA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approval cannot be assured. Foreign regulatory approvals would be required for sales in key markets outside of the United States, which would involve some similar and some different requirements. The NADA is comprised of five principal Technical Sections and one administrative submission that are subject to the FDA’s phased review. By statute, each Technical Section submission is generally subject to a six-month review cycle by the FDA. Each Technical Section can be reviewed and approved separately. Upon review and assessment by the FDA that all requirements for a Technical Section have been met, the FDA may issue a Technical Section Complete Letter. The current status of our work on these submissions to the FDA is as follows:
 
1) Environmental Impact: During the third quarter of 2008, we received the Environmental Impact Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.
 
2) Target Animal Safety: During the second quarter of 2012, we received the Target Animal Safety Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.
 
3) Effectiveness: During the third quarter of 2012, we received the Effectiveness Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA. The draft product label carries claims for the treatment of subclinical mastitis associated with Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci in lactating dairy cattle.
 
4) Human Food Safety (HFS): The HFS Technical Section submission was made during the fourth quarter of 2010. This Technical Section includes several subsections such as: a) toxicology, b) total metabolism, c) effects of drug residues in food on human intestinal microbiology, d) effects on bacteria of human health concern (antimicrobial resistance) and e) pivotal residue chemistry. During the second quarter of 2011, we announced that the FDA had accepted the subsections described above and granted Mast Out®a zero milk discard period and a zero meat withhold period during and after treatment. Before we can obtain this Technical Section Complete Letter, we must transfer our analytical method that measures Nisin residues in milk to a government laboratory. Completion of the HFS Technical Section is currently anticipated during the second half of 2017.
 
5) Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC): Obtaining FDA approval of the CMC Technical Section defines the critical path to FDA approval and to initial commercial sales. During the third quarter of 2014, we completed an investment in facility modifications and processing equipment necessary to produce the Drug Substance (the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, which is our pharmaceutical-grade Nisin) at small-scale. This small-scale facility has been used to i) expand our process knowledge and controls, ii) establish operating ranges for critical process parameters, iii) optimize process yields and iv) verify the cost of production. We believe these efforts will reduce risk as we invest in the commercial-scale production facility.

Implementing Nisin production at commercial scale is the most critical action in front of us on our path to regulatory approval. Our initial plan was to have Nisin produced for us under a Development and Manufacturing Agreement with Lonza Sales, Ltd. of Basel, Switzerland, in order to avoid the investment in a manufacturing facility. By the end of 2011, we determined that the required minimum volumes were too large to permit efficient, continuous production and that the cost of goods under this contract would not be commercially feasible. This contract was terminated during the fourth quarter of 2014 by mutual consent. We presented this product development opportunity to a variety of large and small animal health companies. During the second quarter of 2013, we received a non-refundable $250,000 exclusive license option fee from a prospective partner that considered manufacturing our Nisin in a plant of their own. During the third quarter of 2013, this prospective partner decided not to execute a development and marketing license because it had determined that, in its opinion, it could not cost-effectively commercialize the product. While such a corporate partnership could have allowed us to avoid the large investment in a commercial-scale production facility, the partner would have taken a large share of the gross margin from all future Mast Out® sales. We are encouraged by the regulatory and marketing feedback from prospective partners, following their due diligence, that our novel mastitis treatment can achieve FDA approval and have a significant, positive impact on the dairy industry. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired land nearby to our existing Portland facility for the construction of our own facility for the commercial-scale production of Nisin. During the third quarter of 2016, we broke ground for this facility, and construction is now well underway and progressing on schedule and within budget. We plan to complete construction by the third quarter of 2017 and installation and qualification of equipment by the first quarter of 2018. To gain regulatory approval of this product, validation batches must be produced at commercial scale, and a detailed CMC Technical Section prepared and submitted to the FDA. We expect that two, six-month reviews of the CMC Technical Section by the FDA will be required. Additionally, successful FDA site inspections must be achieved.
 
After preparing materials responsive to other administrative requirements, the administrative NADA submission will be assembled for review by the FDA. This final administrative submission is subject to a statutory sixty-day review period. Adherence to this timeline sets us up for anticipated regulatory approval in 2019.
 
We are party to a long-term, exclusive supply agreement with Nordson Corporation (formerly Plas-Pak Inc.) of Norwich, Connecticut covering the proprietary syringe that was developed specifically for treating cows with Mast Out®. These syringes were used for all pivotal studies of Mast Out®. During the fourth quarter of 2015, this contract was extended through December 31, 2020. A further extension past December 31, 2020 would be required, unless an alternative supplier is identified.
 
Since 2010, we have been party to a long-term, exclusive Contract Manufacture Agreement with Norbrook Laboratories Limited of Newry, Northern Ireland, an FDA-approved Drug Product (sterile-filled and packaged syringes) manufacturer, covering the formulation and sterile-filling of the Drug Substance into Drug Product for Mast Out®. Norbrook provided these services for clinical material used in all pivotal studies of Mast Out®. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a revised agreement with Norbrook covering the final development and commercial-scale launch of Mast Out® after FDA approval.
 
In addition to our work on Mast Out®, we are actively developing further improvements, extensions or additions to our current First Defense® product line. For example, we currently are developing treatments that could prevent calf scours caused by enteric pathogens in addition to E. coli K99 and bovine coronavirus (the current disease claims for First Defense®). In connection with that effort, during the second quarter of 2009 we entered into an exclusive license with the Baylor College of Medicine covering the underlying rotavirus vaccine technology used to generate the specific antibodies. This perpetual license (if not terminated for cause) is subject to milestone and royalty payments. If approved, this would be the first passive antibody product on the market with USDA-approved disease claims providing immediate immunity against each of the three leading causes of calf scours: E. coli, coronavirus and rotavirus. Results from pilot studies completed during the first quarter of 2009 justified continued product development. We initiated a second pivotal effectiveness study at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine during the second quarter of 2014 and announced positive effectiveness results from this pivotal study during the first quarter of 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, we obtained concurrence from the USDA that we have been granted disease claims against bovine rotavirus for our product. We are now working to complete the other laboratory and manufacturing objectives required for product license approval. This could position us to achieve product licensure and market launch of this product, First Defense® Tri-Shield™, with the expanded claims during the second half of 2017. We intend to continue selling the bivalent formats of First Defense® as options for customers after the launch of First Defense® Tri-Shield™. We are currently working to establish USDA claims for our bivalent gel tube (expected during the second half of 2017) and bulk powder (expected during 2018) formulations of First Defense Technology®. At the same time, we are working to expand our product development pipeline of bacteriocins that can be used as alternatives to traditional antibiotics. During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into a three-year exclusive option agreement to license new bacteriocin technology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This technology focuses on bacteriocins having activity against Gram-negative infections for use in combating mastitis in dairy cattle. Subject to the availability of needed financial and other resources, we intend to begin new development projects that are aligned with our core competencies and market focus. We also remain interested in acquiring, on suitable terms, other new products and technologies that fit with our sales focus on the dairy and beef industries.

Competition
 
Our competition in the animal health market includes other biotechnology companies and major animal health companies. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development capabilities than we do.
 
We would consider any company that sells an antibiotic to treat mastitis, such as Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health, a division of Pfizer, Inc.), Merck Animal Health and Boehringer Ingelheim, to be among the potential competitors for Mast Out®. We expect the FDA to grant a period of five years of market exclusivity for Mast Out® (meaning the FDA would not grant approval to a second NADA with the same active drug for a period of five years after the first NADA approval is granted) under Section 512(c)(2)F of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
 
There are several other products on the market, some with claims and some without, that are delivered to newborn calves to prevent scours. We believe that First Defense® offers two significant competitive advantages. First, First Defense® is the only product that provides protection against both E. coli and coronavirus, the two leading causes of calf scours. Second, First Defense®, being derived from colostrum, offers Immediate Immunity™ through antibodies that function both at the gut level and are absorbed into the blood stream for future protection. To complement this, First Defense® is easier to use, requires no mixing or refrigeration, and can be administered without delaying maternal colostrum.
 
Zoetis sells a product that competes directly with First Defense® in preventing scours via oral delivery to newborn calves. Their product (Calf-Guard®) is a modified-live virus vaccine, but we know that newborn calves respond poorly to vaccines and that the immune system must be given time to develop a response to vaccines. Like First Defense®, Calf-Guard® carries a claim against coronavirus infections, but this product does not carry a claim against E. coli infections like First Defense® does. Calf-Guard® carries a claim against rotavirus that First Defense® does not currently carry. First Defense® is priced at a premium to Calf-Guard®. It is common practice to delay colostrum feeding when dosing a calf with Calf-Guard® so that the antibodies in the colostrum do not inactivate the vaccine product. There is no nutritional benefit to withholding milk from calves. In contrast, we encourage the feeding of four quarts of high quality colostrum immediately after birth when dosing a calf with First Defense®, which is standard practice for good calf health. Because the antibodies in First Defense® would likely work to inactivate a modified-live vaccine, rendering it useless or less useful, our product label historically included a precaution that First Defense® should not be used within five days of such a vaccine. During the first quarter of 2015, the USDA granted us permission to remove this precaution from our label. We believe that this precaution should be required on the Calf-Guard® label to prevent inactivation of that product by First Defense® or colostrum.
 
Elanco Animal Health (a division of Eli Lilly and Company) and Boehringer Ingelheim also sell directly competitive products. The Elanco product (Bovine Ecolizer® + C20) was acquired through Elanco’s January 2015 acquisition of Novartis Animal Health and carries claims to prevent scours in newborn calves caused by E. Coli and Clostridium perfringens. We also compete for market share against a Boehringer Ingelheim product (Bar-Guard-99™). This product carries claims to prevent scours in newborn calves caused by E. coli. These latter two products are both derived from equine serum in contrast to the bovine colostrum used for First Defense®. Equine antibodies are less efficiently absorbed into the bloodstream, so fewer antibodies are re-secreted for additional protection.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2016, Merck launched a new competitive product into this market space. This product (BOVILIS® Coronavirus) is a modified-live virus intranasal vaccine.

Market research that we have access to suggests that we captured approximately 37% of the market comprised of the four leading scours preventatives given orally to newborn calves during 2016. This estimate is down from 39% during 2015 and up from 33% during 2014. This market share estimate has increased from 22% during 2012 and 26% during 2013 as the total market size has steadily increased. We will begin tracking the market share of the new Merck product during 2017.
 
First Defense® also competes against scours vaccines sold by Zoetis and Merck that are given to the dam (mother cow) to increase her production of antibodies that can then be transferred through her colostrum to the calf. Despite the best-managed dam vaccine program, colostrum quality is naturally variable and newborn calves do not always get the antibodies they need from maternal colostrum. We believe that the guaranteed dose of antibodies in First Defense®  provides more consistent protection than such vaccine products.
 
We may not be aware of competition that we face, or may face in the future, from other companies. Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract and retain key scientific, managerial and sales personnel, to develop proprietary technologies and products, to obtain USDA or FDA approval for new products, to effectively promote and market our products, to have available properly licensed, efficient and effective raw material and finished product manufacturing resources and to continue to profitably sell our current products. We currently compete on the basis of product performance, price and distribution capability. We continue to monitor our network of independent distributors to maintain our competitive position.
 
Patents, Proprietary Information and Trademarks
 
In 2004, we were issued U.S. Patent No. 6,794,181 entitled “Method of Purifying Lantibiotics” covering a manufacturing process for Drug Substance (pharmaceutical-grade Nisin). In the future, we may file additional patent applications for certain products under development. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued with respect to any pending or future applications. In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain products or processes. Instead, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant proprietary technology through operational measures and contractual agreements.
 
We have registered certain trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the sale of our products. We own federal trademark registrations of the following trademarks: ImmuCell; First Defense®, our calf scours preventive product, Mast Out®, our mastitis treatment product under development, Your Calf Crew®, a term used to describe our sales team and First Defense Technology®, the product name we use for line extensions of First Defense® without disease claims. We utilize the trademark Immediate Immunity™ in connection with the marketing of our products, and we intend to apply to register this mark and related design during 2017. The FDA has determined that the name Mast Out® is overly promotional. Rather than continuing an appeal of this decision, we have decided to select a new product name before market launch. During the first quarter of 2017, we sold our registered trademarks related to Wipe Out® Dairy Wipes when we discontinued that product line.
 
Government Regulation
 
We believe that we are in compliance with current regulatory requirements relating to our business and products. The manufacture and sale of animal health biologicals within the United States is generally regulated by the USDA (Center for Veterinary Biologics). We have received USDA and Canadian Food Inspection Agency approval for First Defense®. Mast Out® is regulated by the FDA, Center for Veterinary Medicine, which regulates veterinary drugs. Regulations in the European Union will likely require that Mast Out® be sold subject to a milk discard requirement in that territory, although the duration of the milk discard requirement may be shorter than the discard requirement applicable to competitive antibiotic products in that market. The manufacture of Wipe Out® Dairy Wipes also was regulated by the FDA. Comparable agencies exist in foreign countries and foreign sales of our products will be subject to regulation by such agencies. Many countries have laws regulating the production, sale, distribution or use of biological products, and we may have to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities in countries in which we propose to sell our products. Depending upon the product and its applications, obtaining regulatory approvals may be a relatively brief and inexpensive procedure or it may involve extensive clinical tests, incurring significant expenses and an approval process of several years’ duration. We generally rely on in-country experts to assist us with or to perform international regulatory applications.
