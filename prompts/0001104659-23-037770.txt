Item 1. Business.
Overview
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to PepperLime Health Acquisition Corporation.
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on June 29, 2021. We were incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses that we have not yet identified (“Business Combination”).
As of December 31, 2022, we had not yet commenced operations. All activity for the period from June 29, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022 relates to our formation, the initial public offering (the “IPO”), which is described below, and subsequent to the IPO, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the investments held in the Trust Account (as defined below).
Our sponsor is PepperOne LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). The registration statement for our IPO was declared effective on October 14, 2021. On October 19, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 15,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $150.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $16.9 million, of which $5.3 million was for deferred underwriting commissions. There was $7.986 million of excess of fair value over price paid for Founder Shares sold to certain qualified institutional buyers or institutional accredited investors (the “Anchor Investors”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.
We granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,250,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, to cover over-allotments, if any. On October 29, 2021, we issued an additional 2,000,000 units (the “Over-Allotment Units”) pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in connection with the IPO, generating gross proceeds of $20.0 million (the “Over-Allotment”). We incurred additional offering costs of $1.1 million in connection with the Over-Allotment (of which $700,000 was for deferred underwriting fees).
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 7,500,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of $7.5 million. On October 29, 2021, simultaneously with the issuance and sale of the Over-Allotment Units, we consummated the sale of an additional 600,000 Private Placement Warrants at $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”), generating additional gross proceeds of $600,000.
Upon the closing of the IPO, the Over-Allotment and the Private Placement, approximately $171.7 million ($10.10 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units and the Private Placement Warrants were placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) and will continue to be invested in United States government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account.
On January 11, 2023, we held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”). At the Extraordinary General Meeting, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which we must consummate our Business Combination from April 19, 2023 to October 19, 2023 (the “Extension Amendment”).
In connection with the approval of the Extension Amendment at the Extraordinary General Meeting, holders of 15,753,079 of our ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price of $10.25 per share, for an aggregate of approximately $161.51 million. Following the payment of the redemptions, the Trust Account had a balance of approximately $12.78 million.

Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. Our Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time we sign a definitive agreement in connection with the Business Combination. However, we will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
We will provide our holders of Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (initially at $10.10 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters.
We will proceed with a Business Combination if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.
If a shareholder vote is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the “Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, a shareholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, we will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If we seek shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor and the other holders of the Founder Shares (the “Initial Shareholders”) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the Initial Shareholders agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming our shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the IPO, without our prior consent.
The Initial Shareholders agreed not to propose an amendment to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our Public Shares in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete a Business Combination, unless we provide the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment.
We have until October 19, 2023 (originally April 19, 2023) to consummate a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”). If we are unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

The Initial Shareholders agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if we fail to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Shareholders acquire Public Shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event we do not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of our Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $10.10 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.10 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.10 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business, execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our Business Combination will be successful.
Our Strategy
We believe the ongoing growth in consumer health and wellness markets industry presents us with a significant opportunity. There are a number of growth drivers, such as regulatory changes that allow for more accessible medical treatments via telehealth, mobile health and other digitized channels, changing population demographics and growth and increased destigmatization of healthcare services around mental and behavioral health needs. We believe that the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has demonstrated the importance of intentional self-care, which includes physical, emotional and sexual care and have conviction that this trend will persist in a post-COVID-19 world. In particular, we have identified physical health, behavioral and mental health, sexual wellness and women’s health and sleep health as areas where digital health and technology-enabled products and services are emerging to provide accessible, affordable, customizable and destigmatized care to a large and growing patient population. With advances in technology, digital therapeutics allow for increased access to care and provide healthcare professionals with the flexibility to scale healthcare services by employing a digital platform. In the case of sexual health, we believe there is a vast opportunity around the growing mainstream understanding that sexual health and wellness is an important part of whole person health and is crucial to relationship satisfaction. While we have long heard about the importance of diet and exercise, the conversation around the positive impact of sexual health is just becoming mainstream. Positive trends toward the destigmatization of sexual diversity, a growing understanding of the nuances of gender and sexual identity and a greater focus on care for women throughout their stages of life has catalyzed an emergence of new consumer-branded and technology-enabled products that serve people across demographics. In addition, there are new use cases, growth and attention paid to legacy brands.
The consumer healthcare and wellness industry and the sexual health and sleep related health verticals in particular, are highly fragmented and host a large number of private companies that could benefit from our team’s deep industry expertise. We have a proven track record of implementing strategic and financial initiatives to turn around stagnant brands, as well as accelerate growth in already high-growth properties, build out platforms through acquisition, expand to new demographics and geographies and utilize new types of technology and media effectively and innovatively. We may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that is outside the consumer health and wellness markets industry.
Industry Overview
Given our team’s core competencies and experiences, we take a differentiated approach to health and wellness. We believe that the different elements of care are most effective when working in tandem. We see many mutually beneficial interactions between the key pillars of health, which can either complement or reinforce target companies’ existing business models. As such, we intend to focus on consumer health and wellness broadly, but have isolated four key focus areas that are both essential to human wellness and boast large,

fragmented and growing end markets. The verticals are physical health, behavioral and mental health, sexual wellness and women’s health and sleep related health. According to a report dated October 15, 2019 by the Global Wellness Institute, the physical activity economy was valued at $828.2 billion in 2018 and will surpass $1.1 trillion by 2023. In addition, according to a report dated July 2021 by Allied Market Research, the global mental health market was valued at $383.1 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $537.97 billion by 2030. According to a report dated December 2022 by Precedence Research, the telehealth market was valued at $48.3 billion in 2022 and is expected to surpass around $224.8 billion by 2030. According to a report dated July 2022 by Acumen Research and Consulting, the global sexual wellness market was valued at $80.1 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $121.6 billion by 2030. According to a report dated July 2022 by Precedence Research, the global sleep aids market size was estimated at $74.3 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow to around $124.97 billion by 2030.
According to a report dated November 24, 1999 by the Journal of American Medical Association, 47% of women and 38% of men have a sexual complaint in the US, which is illustrative of a large market opportunity. According to a report dated July 22, 2020 by Research and Markets, 57% of the sexual wellness market is comprised of sexual wellness products. The combination of these end markets showcases the grand scale that overall consumer health and wellness operates in.
Furthermore, a survey dated August 2020 by McKinsey & Company, 79% of respondents believe health and wellness is important and 42% consider it a top priority. Furthermore, the report also found that the categories of health, fitness, mindfulness and sleep comprised 70.8% of consumer spending, demonstrating an expansive market.
Physical Health
We believe that a healthy lifestyle is key to happiness. This market is by far the biggest in the health category and is rapidly digitizing. According to a report dated October 15, 2019 by the Global Wellness Institute, the Global Web Index found that the fitness/mind-body market, a subset of the $828.2 billion physical activity economy, was worth $595 billion in 2018. The physical activity economy includes the sports and active recreation, fitness and mindful movement core segments — along with the supporting markets of equipment and supplies, apparel and footwear and technology. According to a report dated October 19, 2020 by Fortune Business Insights, Fortune Business Insights also predicts the industry is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 25.2% from 2020 – 2027. Many factors have contributed to the growth of telehealth, including increased traditional healthcare costs, public and private funding for telemedicine, an increase in digital health users and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated regulatory shifts.
Behavioral and Mental Health
According to a report dated July 2021 by Allied Market Research, the global mental health market was valued at $383.1 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $537.97 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.5% from 2021 to 2030. According to a report dated December 2022 by Precedence Research, as of 2020, the global telehealth market size relating to physical and mental health was valued at $48.3 billion in 2022 and is projected to surpass around $224.8 billion in 2030. The destigmatization around mental health support and increasing prevalence of mental disorders including anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and chronic stress are propelling the market demand. Clinical advancement in therapies, online counseling and behavioral health software are also driving the growth of the behavioral health market. The proliferation of digital products aimed at mental health, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has helped to create a virtuous cycle of destigmatization around mental health issues and has increased demand for accessible products.
Sexual Wellness and Women’s Health
According to a report dated July 2022 by Acumen Research and Consulting, the global sexual wellness market is projected to proceed at a CAGR of 4.8% from 2022 to 2030. The same report also found the global sexual wellness market was valued at $80.1 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $121.6 billion by 2030. According to a report dated November 24, 1999 by the Journal of American Medical Association, 47% of women and 38% of men have a sexual complaint in the US, which is illustrative of a large market opportunity. According to a report dated July 22, 2020 by Research and Markets, 57% of the sexual wellness market is comprised of sexual wellness products. The combination of these end markets showcases the grand scale that overall consumer health and wellness operates in. Accordingly, we believe there are compelling merger and acquisition opportunities that have been overlooked by mainstream strategic and financial sponsor acquirors.

According to a report dated April 2022 by Grand View Research, the women’s health market was worth $38 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% from 2022 to 2030. North America and Europe currently dominate over half of women’s health spend, and there’s an opportunity for growth in Asia.
Sleep Related Health
According to the CDC, sleep related health is integral to mental and physical health, with lack of sleep being linked to issues such as chronic disease and depression. According to a report dated July 2022 by Precedence Research, the global market for sleep aids was estimated at $74.3 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach around $124.7 billion by 2030 with a CAGR of 5.95% for the period of 2022 to 2030. The global sleep aids market is segmented into mattresses and pillows, sleep apnea devices, medications, sleep laboratories and home sleep tests.
Key Differentiators

We believe that the following characteristics will positively contribute to our ability to identify an attractive target:

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Combination Criteria
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses and, when evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will use the following and other criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our Business Combination with a target business that does not meet any or all these criteria and guidelines. Our targets include businesses that

● | May be health and wellness platforms including, but not limited to, platforms that are either technology-enabled or are primed for technological innovation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Operate within fragmented markets that have a large number of under-the-radar investment opportunities due to the historically stigmatized nature of various healthcare verticals, such as sexual wellness and women’s health and behavioral health;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have the potential to address aspects of consumer health and wellness by leveraging our expertise in a variety of channels, such as retail, digital, and clinical modalities as well as the team’s understanding of whole-body health and wellness;

● | Offer attractive potential returns for our shareholders; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------

These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets
We believe our management team’s significant operating, investment and transaction experience set and differentiated relationships with company management and ownership teams across our target sectors will provide us with a substantial number of potential Business Combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team operating, sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. In addition, members of our management team have developed contacts from serving on the boards of directors of several companies.
We believe this network will provide our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which are proprietary or where a limited group of investors are invited to participate in the sale process. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with important sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.

We are not prohibited from pursuing a Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, directors or officers. In the event we seek to complete a Business Combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, directors or officers, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another valuation or appraisal firm that regularly renders fairness opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire that such a Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
If any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such Business Combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such Business Combination opportunity to us. Our directors and officers currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.
Our executive offices are located at 548 Market Street, Suite 97425, San Francisco, California 94104 and our telephone number is (415) 263-9939.
Mail addressed to us and received at our registered office will be forwarded unopened to the forwarding address supplied by us to be dealt with. None of the Company or our directors, officers, advisors or service providers (including the organization which provides registered office services in the Cayman Islands) will bear any responsibility for any delay howsoever caused with regards to mail reaching the forwarding address.
Sources of Target Businesses
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or other communications. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account.
We are not prohibited from pursuing a Business Combination with a Business Combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or from completing the Business Combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete a Business Combination with a Business Combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or a valuation or appraisal firm, that such a Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Selection of a target business and structuring of a Business Combination
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information, which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the Business Combination transaction.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the 

10



identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination.
Lack of business diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our Business Combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete Business Combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business.
By completing our Business Combination with only a single entity our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several Business Combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry.
Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:

● | solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our Business Combination.
Limited ability to evaluate the target’s management team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Business Combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our Business Combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Business Combination.
Following our Business Combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Shareholders may not have the ability to approve our Business Combination
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.
Under Nasdaq listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our Business Combination if, for example:

● | we issue Class A ordinary shares that will either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of Class A ordinary shares then issued and outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company; (ii) the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote; (iii) the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed Business Combination; (iv) other time and budget constraints of the company; and (v) additional legal complexities of a proposed Business Combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
The Companies Act and Cayman Islands law do not currently require, and we are not aware of any other applicable law that will require, shareholder approval of our Business Combination.
Permitted purchases and other transactions with respect to our securities
In the event we seek shareholder approval of our Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Business Combination. There is no limit on the number of securities such persons may purchase. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our Business Combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material non-public information), our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our Business Combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. Such persons will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy requires insiders to (1) refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (2) clear certain trades prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our Business Combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our Business Combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.
The purpose of such transaction could be to (1) vote in favor of the Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of our Business Combination, (2) reduce the number of warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our Business Combination or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our securities and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.

12



Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors and/or any of their respective affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of public shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our Business Combination. To the extent that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates enter into private transactions, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our Business Combination. Such persons would select the shareholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our Business Combination. Our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Any purchases by our sponsor, directors, officers and/or any of their respective affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will be restricted unless such purchases are made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, directors, officers and/or any of their respective affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.
Redemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At the completion of our Business Combination, we will be required to purchase any ordinary shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.10 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our Business Combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial shareholders, directors and officers have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and (other than the anchor investors) any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our Business Combination.
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. Additionally, a net tangible asset may be contained in the agreement relating to our Business Combination. In addition, our proposed Business Combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Business Combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our Business Combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of our IPO, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements.
Limitation on redemption upon completion of our Business Combination if we seek shareholder approval
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming our shares with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage 

13



shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Business Combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Business Combination, particularly in connection with a Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Business Combination.
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no Business Combination
As a result of the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal at the Extraordinary General Meeting, we have 24 months, rather than 18 months, from the closing of our IPO to complete our Business Combination. If we have not completed our Business Combination within such 24-month period or during any additional extended time that we have to consummate a Business Combination beyond 24 months as a result of a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (an “additional extension period”), we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Business Combination within the 24-month time period or during any additional extension period.
The Initial Shareholders and our directors and officers have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of our IPO or during any extension period. However, if our initial shareholders (or any of our directors, officers or affiliates) acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our Business Combination within the allotted 18-month time period or during any extension period.
Our initial shareholders, directors and officers have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of our IPO or during any extension period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. Additionally, a net tangible asset or minimum cash requirement may be contained in the agreement relating to our Business Combination.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $891,154 of proceeds held outside the trust account as at December 31, 2022, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.10. The proceeds deposited in the trust account 

14



could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.10. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver only if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not completed our Business Combination within the required time period, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our Business Combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.10 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (1) $10.10 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.10 per share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to $891,154 from the proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants as December 31, 2022, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.

15



If we file a winding-up or bankruptcy petition or an involuntary winding-up or bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable insolvency law, and may be included in our insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.10 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a winding-up or bankruptcy petition or an involuntary winding-up or bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or insolvency laws as a voidable performance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) our completion of a Business Combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of our IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity; and (3) the redemption of our public shares if we have not completed a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of our IPO or during any extension period, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants.
Competition
We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these entities and other investors are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we have and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek shareholder approval of our Business Combination and we are obligated to pay cash for our Class A ordinary shares, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our Business Combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a Business Combination. If we have not completed our Business Combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.10 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.
Indemnity
Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.10 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations.
Employees
We currently have four executive officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our Business Combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend 

16



to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Business Combination and the current stage of the Business Combination process.
Corporate Information
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands Government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (1) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (2) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated with limited liability on June 29, 2021. Our executive offices are located at 548 Market Street, Suite 97425, San Francisco, California 94104, and our telephone number is (415) 263-9939. Our corporate website address is www.pepperlimehealth.com. 
Summary of Risk Factors
An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In that event, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:

17




● | We are a recently incorporated company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Past performance by our management team or their affiliates, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Global or regional conditions may adversely affect our business and our ability to consummate our Business Combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As the number of special purpose acquisition companies remains significant, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our Business Combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate a Business Combination.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our search for a target, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a Business Combination, may be materially adversely affected by the geopolitical uncertainty and macroeconomic environment resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and subsequent sanctions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We maintain our cash at financial institutions, often in balances that exceed federally insured limits, and our liquidity could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash fail.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) or other regulatory agencies may modify, delay or prevent our Business Combination.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed Business Combination, which means we may complete our Business Combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential Business Combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we seek shareholder approval of our Business Combination, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote in favor of such Business Combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential Business Combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a Business Combination with a target.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable Business Combination or optimize our capital structure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The requirement that we complete our Business Combination within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a Business Combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential Business Combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our Business Combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders.

● | Our search for a Business Combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a Business Combination, may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and other events and the status of debt and equity markets.

● | If we seek shareholder approval of our Business Combination, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may elect to purchase shares or warrants from public shareholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed Business Combination and reduce the public “float” of our securities.

● | If a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our Business Combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.

● | You are not entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.

● | Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for Business Combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our Business Combination. If we have not completed our Business Combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.10 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on our redemption of their shares, and our warrants will expire worthless.

● | If the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the duration of the completion window, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our Business Combination and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search for a Business Combination, to make permitted withdrawals and to complete our Business Combination. If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unable to complete our Business Combination.
