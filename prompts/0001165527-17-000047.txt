History and Evolution of Trident Brands
 
Trident Brands Incorporated was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 5, 2007 as Sandfield Ventures Corp.

We are currently in the product introduction and commercialization phase of this business focus.

On June 12, 2013 the Board of Directors approved an agreement and plan of merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary called Trident Brands Incorporated.  At that point we changed our name from Sandfield Ventures Corp. to Trident Brands Incorporated and Mark Holcombe assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer.
 
Following that, on July 9, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a resolution to affect a 4 for 1 forward stock split. Upon effect of the forward split, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock increased from 7,000,000 to 28,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001
 
On August 1, 2013, our directors approved the adoption of our 2013 Stock Option Plan which permits us to issue up to 4,200,000 shares of our common stock to directors, officers, employees and consultants of our company upon the exercise of stock options granted under the 2013 Stock Option Plan.
 
On December 23, 2013, we signed a 15 year license agreement (including a ten year extension option) with Everlast® World’s Boxing Headquarters Corp., International Brand Management & Licensing, to market and sell products in the nutritional foods and supplements category under the Everlast® brand. This licensing agreement enables us to introduce a portfolio of nutritional products in categories such as supplements and functional foods using this brand mark.

On May 5, 2014, we entered into a Product Development Agreement with Continental Ingredients Canada Inc. in support of our plan to commercialize nutritional supplements and functional food and beverage products for sales in North America.

There had been no disagreements with George Stewart, CPA on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of George Stewart, CPA would have caused them to make reference thereto in connection with their report on the financial statements for such years.

Business Objectives and Strategies
 
Our business brings together many years of seasoned expertise in branded consumer products, supply chain, product development and corporate finance. Our team has experience in developing and commercializing consumer products, in both global companies and specialty markets.
 
Our objective is to provide our shareholders with solid returns through strategic investments across multiple consumer product and food ingredient platforms. The platforms we are focusing on include:
 
 
· | Life science technologies and related products that have applications to a range of consumer products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nutritional supplements and related consumer goods providing defined benefits to the consumer; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Functional foods and beverages ingredients with defined health and wellness benefits.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We are building our business through strategic investments in high growth early stage consumer brands and functional ingredients platforms within segment/sectors which we believe offer long term growth potential.  We are focused on three core strategies underpinning our objectives:
 
 
· | To execute our multi-tier brand and innovation strategy to drive revenue;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | To aggressively manage our asset light business model to drive a low cost platform; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | To drive disciplines leading to increased investor awareness and ability to finance and govern growing operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



While we have yet to realize break even cash flows or profitability, we believe we are making progress against our goals and objectives, and expect revenues and margins to increase as we begin commercializing the products within our portfolio. All three of our product platforms show solid potential in the markets where they compete and both our Everlast® and Brain Armor® product lines are now in the market and generating revenues.  We are also developing a full range of private label product offerings.  The development of Oceans Omega as an ingredient for food and beverage products is ongoing, and given the longer sales cycle for ingredients, we expect to realize revenues in 2017 both through external customer product development and also internally via potential line extensions for both the Everlast® and Brain Armor® product lines.
 
Our purpose is to apply these capabilities in starting new product lines with specific competitive advantage.  Our product development is focused on:
 
 
· | Extending established brands with existing equity that can be leveraged;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Delivering consumer benefit with unique technology or intellectual properties; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Targeting dynamic growth segments.
--+-----------------------------------



Coupled with strategic capital investment, our focus is on investments within the fast growing nutritional product and functional food segments/sectors. Our goal is to provide our shareholders with outstanding ROI through a portfolio of branded platforms via an asset light business model when and where appropriate.
 
As part of our long-term strategy we are targeting the following growth opportunities:
 
 
· | Brand licenses in fast growing categories;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | Consumer goods with focus on supplements, functional foods & beverages;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Life science technology that has applications in consumer products with a focus on nutritional, brain and heart health products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Intellectual property and/or licenses in recognized brand platforms.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------



In addition to investments in brands and technology, we will seek to acquire positions in businesses to support our strategy through the use of common and/or preferred equity, senior secured, unsecured, and convertible debt in organizations who meet our investment goals. Through our management and directors vast expertise in both the consumer branded segment and strategic investment experience, we seek to provide our shareholders a sound return on their investment.

The Company’s strategic objective is to:
 
 
· | Build and grow strategic brands organically;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | Make strategic investments in high growth companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | Develop and then merge brands/business lines into larger multi-national Companies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mitigate risk by creating a diverse portfolio of brands/operations in the growth sectors listed above.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brands
 
Everlast®
 
We have a long term license, with a 10 year extension option, to market and sell products in the nutritional foods and supplements category under the Everlast® brand. The US Dietary Supplement Segment continues to experience dynamic growth driven by favorable demographic trends, increased media coverage of dietary issues and greater emphasis on preventive health/wellness practices in the healthcare industry, and the Everlast® line of products are designed to capitalize on this dynamic.
Brain Armor®
 
In March 2015, we acquired, through a licensing agreement, the exclusive global rights to Brain Armor®, a plant-based DHA supplement designed specifically for the needs of athletes. Brain Armor® helps optimize cognitive and visual performance by supplying a meaningful amount of DHA, an important Omega-3 shown to support brain, eye and heart health. Brain Armor® is powered by Life’s DHA®, a patented plant source of DHA grown in a FDA inspected facility.
Oceans Omega
 
In January 2016 we obtained the rights to purchase, market, sell and distribute certain patented Omega 3 products produced by Oceans Omega LLC.  The products have application as a functional food ingredient and include breakthrough technology for omega 3 fortification of food and beverages.  Prior to acquiring these rights we acted as a distributor for the then rights owner.
Product Supply
 
We procure our products utilizing a series of ingredient suppliers and strategic contract manufacturers. All suppliers are pre-qualified and must meet our stringent quality and performance standards. We also have a strategic agreement with Continental Ingredients Canada (“CIC”) whereby they provide services for the development, manufacturing, and supply of our Everlast Nutrition® and Brain Armor™ brand nutritional supplements, and functional food and beverage products.  CIC’s services include research and development, design, ingredient sourcing, production, distribution, and inventory management of our planned portfolio of branded products.  In addition, CIC manages all third party suppliers and manufacturers, and provides us with office space at their Oakville, Ontario, facility.  
Competition
 
We compete in the highly competitive branded nutritional products and functional foods market segments. These markets are highly competitive with many companies, large and small, competing for market share. The nutritional products market is one of the fastest growing markets in the world producing close to 32 billion dollars in revenue in 2012, and is projected to double, producing revenues exceeding 60 billion dollars by 2021 according to the Nutritional Business Journal. With the combination of high quality, scientifically designed and cost competitive products, and the equity in our brands, we believe we will be able to gain market share in rapidly growing markets.
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
Our operations, supply chain and products are subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in various regions where we operate, including the U.S. and Canada.  These laws, regulations and policies are implemented, as applicable in each jurisdiction, on the national, federal, state, provincial and local levels.  We believe we have processes and systems in place throughout our supply chain to meet the requirements of these regulations.
 
 11
 
 
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements, or Labor Contracts
 
We currently do not directly own any material patents, trademarks, copyrights, franchises or concessions as these are currently owned by our licensing partners.  We will assess the need for any copyright, trademark or patent applications on an ongoing basis as our business develops.
Human Resources, Contract Service Providers, Employees
 
We operate our business via resources that provide services to the Company on a contractual basis.  We feel this is most prudent as we can cost effectively meet our needs and leverage capabilities of talented individuals without employing on a full time basis.  As the business grows we expect to add a number of full-time employees.  We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. Except for our stock option plan, there are presently no personal benefits available to our officers and directors.
Reports to Securities Holders
 
We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders.  We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules of Regulation S-K for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  We are subject to disclosure filing requirements, including filing Form 10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly.  In addition, we will file Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required.  We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act.  The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ("SEC"), at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549.  The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.  The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
