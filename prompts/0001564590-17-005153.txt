Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a commercial stage company that develops and markets products and services based on proprietary technology that facilitates the routine use of targeted molecular profiling. Molecular profiling is the collection of information about multiple molecular targets, such as DNA and RNA, also called biomarkers, in a biological sample. Molecular profiling information has many important applications, from basic research to molecular diagnostics in personalized medicine. Our technology can be used throughout that range of applications, which is just one of its many benefits. Our focus is on clinical applications. Our primary customer segments include biopharmaceutical companies, academic research centers and molecular testing laboratories.
 Historically, molecular profiling has faced several technical challenges in clinical applications. These include (i) limited “multiplexing,” which means only a few biomarkers could be tested in a single sample, (ii) the need for vast amounts of sample to test more than a few biomarkers, which often required several different technologies conducted in different locations, (iii) complex sample preparation, and (iv) manual and/or time consuming workflows. Even where it was possible to test tens, hundreds or thousands of biomarkers, such as with fixed arrays, data analysis could be quite complicated and time consuming.
 Our proprietary technology has several key differentiators, including (i) multiplexing from tens to thousands of biomarkers in a single sample, (ii) very low sample input requirements, (iii) simple, extraction-free sample preparation, which is effective with a wide variety of samples, (iv) automated workflow with sample-to-result turnaround times rivaling any current competitor, and (v) simplified data output. In addition, our HTG EdgeSeq assay technology, launched in 2014, generates a molecular profiling library for detection using NGS. Among other things, NGS provides improved sensitivity and dynamic range for our HTG EdgeSeq assays. We believe these advantages position us to outperform most other now-available molecular profiling technologies, especially in certain sample types, such as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, or FFPE. While we continue to advance our technology, we are particularly focused on gaining market recognition and expanding our product offerings.
 Our current sources of revenue include services provided by our VERI/O laboratory (discussed below) and sales of our automation systems and integrated NGS-based HTG EdgeSeq assays. Our current assay product offerings include the following:
  
• | HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel,

• | HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay,
--+-----------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq Lymphoma Panel,
--+----------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq microRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay, and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay.
--+----------------------------------------

 Our assays are currently sold for research use only, except in Europe where our diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, assay is CE-marked and available for diagnostic use. In March 2017, we obtained CE-marking of our HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay in Europe, and we continue work on our pre-market approval, or PMA, submission for this assay in the United States. In 2017, we also have a focused development pipeline of new profiling products, which includes planned panels for translational research, drug development, and molecular diagnostics with initial focus in immuno-oncology and next generation pathology. We also expect to complete feasibility testing on several new technological developments, including our direct-target sequencing “version 2” chemistry, or V2 chemistry.
 Our HTG EdgeSeq assays are automated on either our HTG Edge or HTG EdgeSeq platform, which may also be referred to as an “instrument” or “processor” and which, together with the assay, is a fully integrated system. Our HTG Edge platform can run both our original, plate-based assays and our NGS-based HTG EdgeSeq assays. We continue to support a small number of customers interested in utilizing our plate-based assays (such as our HTG Edge DMPK Core CYP Assay or otherwise on a custom manufacturing basis); however, in 2016, based on market trends and customer feedback, we shifted our product focus to our NGS‑based HTG EdgeSeq system.
 Customers can also obtain the advantages of our proprietary technology by engaging our VERI/O laboratory for pre-clinical and clinical research-related services, including drug development and translational research. Our VERI/O lab processes samples for molecular profiling data or, if aligned with our clinical diagnostic product strategy, designs custom research or investigational profiling assays. In 2017, we also expect to deploy our V2 chemistry in the VERI/O lab for detection of DNA mutations.
 We believe the value propositions of our products and services are gaining significant recognition. In 2016, we entered into agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, and Merck KGaA, which are just two examples of the 36 individual project programs with biopharmaceutical companies employing our proprietary technology in their clinical research and drug development programs as of December 31, 2016.

As we navigate product-related regulatory requirements to launch additional molecular diagnostic products, initially in Europe and then in the United States, we expect our research products and services will continue to drive market recognition and technology adoption. Further, we expect that strategically positioning our proprietary technology, products and services in drug or other clinical development programs will drive a future, ongoing portfolio of molecular diagnostic products, including companion diagnostic products. 
 We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we have never been profitable. We incurred net losses of $26.0 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $115.6 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had available cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $7.5 million and investments in short-term corporate and government debt securities totaling $4.3 million, and had current liabilities of approximately $10.0 million plus an additional $14.0 million in long-term liabilities primarily attributable to our growth term loan and our obligation to NuvoGen Research LLC, or NuvoGen.   
 Our Strategy
 Our objective is to establish the HTG solutions as the standard in molecular profiling, and to make their benefits accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic. The key components of our strategy are:

• | Focus on immuno-oncology based molecular profiling. We plan to develop novel RNA-based gene classifiers to help biopharmaceutical companies and leading translational medicine researchers better understand and predict durable response to immune checkpoint inhibitor drug candidates, such as anti-PD-L1 therapeutics, in mono- and combination therapies. We also plan to develop novel DNA profiling tests that can provide information about mutation load and microsatellite instability, which are genetics factors believed to be associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase and strengthen companion diagnostics collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies. We believe collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies with late-stage drug development programs will lead to us generating companion diagnostic consumables revenue. As of December 31, 2016, we had 36 active development programs across 16 leading biopharmaceutical companies which are incorporating companion diagnostics in their drug development programs. We plan to expand upon our first companion diagnostic partnership (Merck KGaA for DLBCL cell of origin determination) with additional companion diagnostic collaborations. We have entered into an agreement with QIAGEN Manchester Limited, a subsidiary of QIAGEN, N.V., or QIAGEN, to expand our commercial and technical capabilities in this market. We intend to continue to leverage our VERI/O laboratory services business to enable nimble response to emerging biopharmaceutical molecular profiling requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase our market adoption by leveraging the advantages of our technology, including low sample input and high sensitivity. We plan to promote global adoption of our proprietary technology in molecular labs, biopharmaceutical companies and major translational research centers by demonstrating the key differentiating aspects of our chemistry and platforms, such as small sample utilization, multiplexing and high sensitivity. These advantages result in cost, time and ease of use benefits for our customers. To facilitate adoption, we announced and branded our VERI/O service laboratory, in 2016, to support customers who desire additional laboratory capacity, assay design services, and/or to access our service-only content offerings and, in addition, we continue to offer our HTG EdgeSeq system and reagents to customers who want to bring our technology in-house.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish our systems workflow as the best solution for clinical sequencing. We intend to continue to establish our technology as the best sample and library preparation method for clinical applications with next generation sequencers. We believe our differentiated HTG EdgeSeq chemistry will accelerate adoption by leveraging the large and growing installed base of next generation sequencers. We are engaged with industry and corporate partners including Illumina, Life Technologies Corporation and QIAGEN, to position our HTG EdgeSeq products as the benchmark for workflow in targeted sequencing applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Develop new molecular diagnostic panels with high medical utility. The HTG platforms were developed with features that we believe will enable local molecular labs to routinely test targeted RNA expression, including expressed gene mutations, such as ALK gene rearrangements using our HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay, all from extremely small samples, such as a single five micron section of FFPE tissue. We plan to develop future molecular diagnostic assays in conformance with existing reimbursement codes to facilitate our clinical customers’ billings. We also plan to work in the major European medical centers to develop and validate certain solid tumor classifiers and lower cost alternatives for breast and prostate cancer testing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the addressable market of HTG technology through new applications. We have demonstrated technical feasibility for several new applications that are intended to allow us to measure DNA mutations directly and in expressed RNA, and improve the already-high sensitivity of our HTG EdgeSeq assays. These new applications are expected to allow us to, among other things, develop future “multi-parameter” panels that detect both RNA and DNA targets in a single assay, for use in translational research, companion diagnostics and molecular diagnostics. We believe these applications and panels can be developed efficiently with reasonable capital investment.

Our Market
 Development of Molecular Profiling
 Molecular profiling is the analysis of biomarkers, including DNA and RNA and protein, in biological samples, such as tissue, cells, blood and other biofluids, to identify gene expression patterns or genomic changes. New molecular approaches are making it possible to perform these characterizations in unprecedented ways, resulting in a shift from the traditional approach of looking at one target at a time to the simultaneous analysis of potentially tens, hundreds or thousands of targets. 
 Among what we believe are the most promising applications of molecular profiling is the targeted sequencing of RNA and DNA from patient samples to identify gene expression patterns or molecular markers of disease that can aid in diagnosis, gauge patient prognosis or predict response to an available therapy. These applications have launched a fundamental shift towards personalized medicine where an individual patient’s molecular profile is used to guide treatment. 
 We estimate that the global molecular profiling market is approximately $27.0 billion today. Based on published industry reports, cancer profiling makes up the largest segment of this market at an estimated $17.8 billion, the substantial majority of which we believe currently consists of research-use-only products, and is expected to grow to $35.0 billion by 2018. Our initial diagnostic products target the approximate $4.0 billion pathology related diagnostic markets where we can transition existing testing methods to NGS-based workflows. The companion diagnostic market is currently estimated at $2.5 billion and growing approximately 18% annually. We believe that the acceleration of investment into immuno therapy drugs will also be a catalyst for future companion diagnostics for combination therapies where gene expression classification is expected to be important.  
 For decades, the treatment of disease was dominated by one-size-fits-all drug regimens. Over the last 10 years, numerous molecular markers and profiling techniques have transitioned from research tools to inclusion in clinical guidelines for patient care. Oncology drug developers have also seen the benefits of molecular markers and today there are many drugs in clinical development with a companion biomarker strategy. 
 Among the vanguard of these personalized treatments were hormone therapies for breast cancer patients whose tumors expressed the estrogen receptor protein. This was followed using trastuzumab for treating patients with HER2-positive breast cancers. This paradigm shift led to significantly improved patient outcomes when compared to the non-specific, chemotherapeutic approaches used in the past.  
 The evolution of molecular profiling has also taken shape over the last decade in non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. NSCLC patients were first profiled for EGFR gene mutations to select patients most likely to respond to the drug erlotinib. Next came testing for ALK gene rearrangements as an indicator of response to the drug crizotinib. Now, additional mutations and rearrangements such as ROS1, RET, HER2, KRAS and MET, have been integrated into the NCCN guidelines for the treatment of lung cancer and are used to guide patient treatments.
 Similar trends are unfolding in other diseases such as thyroid cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma. These trends are fueling rapid growth of new molecular profiling offerings, technologies and industry business models to support the demand. The fastest growing segment of the estimated $10.6 billion molecular diagnostics market, a subset of the estimated $27.0 billion global molecular profiling market, is clinical testing in oncology. As oncologists rapidly integrate this new level of molecular profiling information into patient management strategies, a growing number of highly specialized central laboratories now offer tests that address specific clinical questions. The trend towards highly multiplexed profiling is not limited to oncology; other examples of expanding demand include prenatal, neonatal, inherited disease, and organ transplant and rejection profiling.

Molecular profiling continues to move into clinical applications, including molecular profiling to develop clinical biomarker strategies, patient stratification for clinical trials, and companion diagnostics. The primary goal is to develop an understanding, at the molecular level, about why a drug does or does not work in a patient population. Variability in patients’ gene expression patterns is believed to at least partially explain why the 25% response rate for oncology therapeutics is among the lowest for all disease states. 
 While the primary objective of these drug-development efforts is to improve response rates, third-party payor pressures to lower patient treatment costs also plays a significant role. As a result, most biopharmaceutical companies develop biomarker strategies to increase the rate of patient response to new drugs in development. Typically, studies will focus on a variety of biological profiling markers that include RNA or protein expression levels, and/or presence or absence of DNA mutations (such as gene fusions and rearrangements), which can be detected in genomic DNA or expressed RNA or protein. Currently, it is estimated that there are over 2,000 clinical trials underway in oncology, and that the clear majority of drug developers believe personalized and targeted therapy development is important to the future success of drug development.
 When a molecular biomarker panel is used for selection of patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a new drug, the drug and biomarker test are often submitted to the applicable regulatory agency for approval together. In the United States, upon Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval of the biomarker test, or companion diagnostic, the patient must be tested with the companion diagnostic prior to treatment with the drug. Companion diagnostic tests have a clear clinical utility which generally supports favorable reimbursement decisions. We believe there are over 900 active oncology drug development programs, most of which have molecular biomarker strategies, creating a significant opportunity for molecular diagnostic companies with the right molecular profiling solutions. 
 Complexities and Challenges of Molecular Profiling Today
 Currently, molecular profiling typically is conducted in the clinical setting using a variety of profiling techniques and instrumentation platforms across multiple laboratory departments, and, in many situations, sent to distant labs. These techniques include immunohistochemistry, or IHC, fluorescent in situ hybridization, or FISH, polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, gene expression arrays, or GEA, and NGS. This distributed profiling approach has accelerated the use of molecular profiling and increased the need to make the process more accessible and routine. However, molecular profiling is also highly specialized because current technologies are complex, require multiple capital-intensive workflows, and are not economically scalable to the case volume of the local laboratory. The fragmentation of methods, sample logistics and information flow has created significant challenges for labs, physicians and patients as discussed below.
Insufficient Sample Availability
 The proliferation of new molecular profiles and technologies has led to the need for more biopsy material to conduct tests of interest. However, the trend is toward less invasive procedures that produce smaller biopsies and thus, in many situations there simply is not enough collected sample to meet all the profiling requirements. For example, historically, the standard method of collecting tumor samples for testing in oncology is via a surgical procedure where the tumor is resected or biopsied and then stabilized, or fixed, in a formaldehyde-based fixative known as formalin. Between 24 to 72 hours after the tissue is removed from the patient, it is permanently stabilized in a hard block of paraffin where it can be stored at room temperature for decades. This preservation technique was developed over 100 years ago, well in advance of the discovery of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. While techniques to recover nucleic acids from these FFPE tissue samples have been developed, formalin fixation presents several technical challenges in analyzing DNA and RNA sequences. Because of the convenience of this preservation method, though, FFPE samples are the starting material for almost all tumor-profiling testing in oncology today. 
 Most commonly, in the past and continuing today, very thin slices of tissue from FFPE blocks, typically five microns in thickness, are affixed to glass slides for testing. Then, a histological stain called an H&E (for the combination of hematoxylin and eosin) is used to differentially mark cellular structures, making it simple for a pathologist to examine the patterns of the normal and diseased tissue under a microscope. IHC stains are also often performed on FFPE tissue slides to aid diagnosis, prognosis or help guide therapy selection, with each IHC stain consuming two slides, one for the stain, and the other for a negative control. Historically, five to ten slides in total were consumed in the complete diagnostic workup for each tumor. With the advent of new molecular techniques there are additional demands for tissue, and most molecular tests on the market today require much more than a single slide. In many clinical situations, there simply is not enough collected tissue to meet all the profiling requirements. The growing number of specialized tumor-profiling tests, and their appetite for FFPE tissue or other sample material, is in direct conflict with the trend towards smaller, less-invasive testing approaches.
 Slow Turnaround Times
 In many cases, turnaround times for comprehensive profiling of a patient’s sample(s) are several weeks due to the logistical time to route samples to various laboratory departments and to distant specialized labs. Several technologies for sample characterization

have been used and introduced over the years to determine the status of various molecular characteristics for a sample. These characteristics include RNA and protein expression levels, and/or the presence or absence of DNA mutations, such as single-point mutations and gene fusions and rearrangements, which mutations can be detected in genomic DNA or expressed RNA and protein. A single tumor specimen from a cancer patient is often profiled for multiple molecular characteristics where each characteristic is measured using a different platform. These platforms are utilized in separate laboratory departments or institutions with different technicians and clinicians, requiring that the sample and data be split into multiple workflows. This also requires even more sample consumption.
 The time it takes to deliver the final report to a treating physician so that informed treatment decisions may be made is dependent on the turnaround time of the slowest test. A single laboratory with well-choreographed routing of tissues and information may be able to complete sample profiling within a week, but if part of the sample needs to be sent for additional profiling at a specialty lab, the total turnaround time may be lengthened by one or two weeks due to shipping, accessioning by the receiving laboratory and integration of the testing results into the final report.
 Implications of Workflow Inefficiencies on Data Quality and Integration
 In addition to the challenges of splitting a single sample into multiple testing workflows, the individual workflow for molecular profiling of biological samples, including FFPE tissues, is complicated. Many of the steps from sample to result require manual intervention by a molecular technician. While these technicians are trained to standard operating procedures and proficiency tested, the levels of proficiency and precision vary among technicians. Variability introduced by technicians performing manual steps can translate to variability of results, with a test sample frequently at risk of experiencing losses of fidelity through the series of separation and transformation steps.
 Further, the increase in number of technologies for sample characterization and fragmentation of the testing workflows can also create challenges in putting all the results together in a timely, complete profiling report. This level of data integration is critical for the treating physicians to assure they have the complete molecular assessment prior to consultation with the patient. Without a complete molecular assessment, there is limited ability to discuss the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options. Overall, we believe the critical relationship between the local pathologist and treating physician has been fractured as many tests results are now sent directly to the treating physician from these specialized and centralized Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, laboratories. We believe the pathologist is critical to aggregating the diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information in a single patient molecular profile that can be utilized by the treating physician for therapeutic decisions.
 Case Study of the Current Limitations in Molecular Profiling: Immuno-Oncology
 A rapidly developing area of oncology drug development is the broad grouping of approaches referred to as immuno-oncology therapies. These immuno-oncology therapeutics include checkpoint inhibitors such as Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for melanoma and NSCLC, cancer vaccines such as chimeric antigen receptors in development by various companies and immunomodulatory therapies such as interferon-alpha. Increasingly, these immuno-therapies are being coupled with more traditional oncology drugs such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chemotherapeutics to create synergistic treatment options that attack multiple aspects of the tumor and potentially increase patient response. 
 While single-biomarker IHC tests have been approved as companion or complimentary diagnostics for anti-PD-1 checkpoint-inhibiting therapies, a proliferation of checkpoint inhibitors targeting additional ligands and receptors for CTLA4, OX40, LAG3, TIM‑3 and others, coupled with combination approaches, is challenging the one-biomarker / one-drug diagnostic paradigm that previously advanced IHC-based companion diagnostics (e.g. HER2, ALK, c-KIT, etc). Understanding the complex biological framework of the tumor microenvironment is becoming increasingly important in interpreting the host immune response to tumors and developing the best single or combination therapy approach.

The need for multiplexed gene expression assessment is illustrated in the graphic below where two histologically similar DLBCL tumors elicit very different host immune responses. Both cases have similar tumor composition and large populations of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (see left-most panel). In case 1, however, the immune system is responding primarily with natural killer lymphocytes, as indicated by the biomarker expression shown in the right-most panel; whereas in case 2, the immune system expresses biomarkers of CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes (center panel). Based on this information and other clinical parameters, very different immunotherapeutic strategies may be recommended to combat the tumor. We believe that current molecular profiling techniques, like IHC, FISH or RT-qPCR, are ill-suited for comprehensive assessment of the tumor microenvironment at least because of the amount of information (e.g. number of biomarkers) relevant to the clinical decision making that needs to be collected from limited amounts of sample in a time- and cost-efficient way. 
 
Case Study of the Current Limitations in Molecular Profiling: NSCLC
 The complexities and potential inefficiencies present in current molecular profiling techniques can be seen in NSCLC. While an increasing number of clinical parameters are being assessed using multiple testing methodologies, the size of the tumor specimen has dramatically decreased, with approximately 70% of lung cancer patients receiving their diagnosis from a small biopsy or cytological specimen. Personalized therapy and entry into clinical trials for NSCLC are heavily dependent on accurate histological classification which is typically performed by IHC. Tumor samples are also routinely tested for various gene mutations and gene rearrangements, with each of these tests performed on a different platform with a disparate workflow. 
 It is common for each of these platforms to be in separate laboratory departments and/or locations with different technicians and clinicians, requiring that the already small sample be split into multiple workflows. The results from the individual testing workflows are typically aggregated into a single report, signed off by the pathologist and transmitted to the oncologist. As outlined in the diagram below, the multiple steps involved in the process may substantially slow turnaround times and result in an incomplete molecular profile not suitable to inform clinical decision making.

Example of Typical NSCLC Testing Workflow
 
Our Solution
 We have developed and sell assays, automation platforms and services based on a proprietary technology that provides precise, efficient molecular profiling of samples for clinical and research purposes. Our proprietary products and services are designed to work with many different biological sample types, can generate robust results from very small samples, and obviate the need for many of the sample-preparation steps associated with traditional molecular profiling techniques. Our platforms and assays enable the simultaneous detection and quantitation of tens, hundreds or thousands of molecular targets and are capable, now or in the future, of profiling multiple parameters such as RNA expression levels, RNA-expressed gene fusions and insertions and DNA mutations in a single testing workflow that can use NGS detection for quantitative measurement.
 We manufacture the consumables utilized with our platforms specifically for our platforms and these consumables cannot be obtained from other sources. At the core of our solution is our proprietary chemistry called quantitative nuclease protection, or qNPA. Our qNPA-based chemistries provide an extremely efficient method for analyzing DNA and RNA as it eliminates the need for DNA or RNA extraction or reverse transcription. We designed and developed our HTG automation platforms to optimize the capabilities of our chemistries, provide fast turnaround time and enable ease of use to molecular labs. Our chemistries and automation platforms are highly adaptable, so when molecular profiling needs change or emerge, we expect to be able to efficiently add new applications to address these needs.
 The HTG systems provide data in a simple easy to use format. The entire workflow for both systems from sample preparation to a molecular profiling report can be accomplished in 24-36 hours.
 We believe most customers in our target markets would prefer to maintain control of their samples and perform the profiling internally but are challenged by limitations in available technologies. We believe we are well positioned to democratize molecular profiling with the following key benefits:
  
• | Optimize sample utilization. The HTG systems can analyze as many as 2,500 genes from extremely small sample volumes such as a single five micron section of tissue or 15 microliters of plasma or serum. Our technology allows customers to do more with less, which meets the needs of clinical or pre-clinical laboratories where today there is often not enough patient sample to do all the testing available or desired. We believe providing customers the ability to work with extremely small sample will be a significant driver of adoption of our technology and systems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compatibility with multiple sample types. Our HTG systems allow customers to profile and unlock molecular information from a wide variety of biological samples such as FFPE tissue, cells, blood serum and plasma. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to profile these and other sample types, and believe we ultimately can profile most clinically relevant sample types, including cell-free circulating nucleic acids from tumors, a rapidly developing area of investigation which is referred to as a liquid biopsy. We believe that the capabilities of our system will allow us to efficiently expand applications, regardless of sample type.

• | Flexible and adaptable chemistry allows for use in multiple applications. We believe our proprietary chemistry provides the ability to measure a variety of molecular targets in many necessary applications, including RNA expression levels, expressed RNA gene rearrangements (such as gene fusions and insertions), and DNA point mutations, and offers the ability to quantify these applications on a variety of NGS platforms. This flexibility provides customers the ability to optimize their use of our technologies based on their specific throughput, workflow and application needs. Our proprietary chemistry is comparatively simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. For example, compared to RT-qPCR, our chemistry does not require extraction or cDNA synthesis. Compared to traditional RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the elimination of these steps helps prevent biases associated with these steps, sample degradation and increased opportunities for technician error.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Robust data. Molecular profiling produces large amounts of information that is used, among other things, to make important decisions, such as identifying potential drug targets or selecting a patient for a therapeutic treatment. This information is valuable only to the extent it accurately represents the true biology of the test sample and the same answer can be produced under many different conditions. Our chemistries are highly specific and sensitive, meaning they can detect the right target even when very little is present in the sample. Our system produces consistent results on a replicate-to-replicate, day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Automation provides superior workflow and ease of use. Our technologies are designed with fewer workflow steps in part due to the elimination of the need for complex sample-preparation processes such as extraction, cDNA synthesis, labeling, selection, depletion and shearing. This enables customers to limit hands-on time and the need for specialized skills, resulting in turnaround times of approximately 24-36 hours. Additionally, our HTG EdgeSeq application further integrates sample preparation for targeted sequencing and greatly simplifies the data bioinformatics, so customers looking to leverage their NGS instrument can seamlessly add this capability to their current workflows.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplified bioinformatics. Our software provides data in a simple and easy to use format through a simple graphical user interface, or GUI, that is flexible enough for researchers yet structured enough for clinical laboratories. The HTG EdgeSeq parser software, which processes the data from the NGS platform, is modular so that new applications can be downloaded without any changes to hardware. We believe the simplicity of our bioinformatics solution will help drive the adoption of our platform.

Current Commercial Panels Offered on the HTG Platforms
 We currently market proprietary molecular profiling panels targeting late stage drug development programs with potential breakthrough therapies, such as immuno-oncology. We market these panels to biopharmaceutical companies, with which we collaborate in biomarker development programs. We believe these programs could facilitate our commercialization of companion diagnostic tests. In addition, our panels are used in pre-clinical and clinical research areas, which, we also believe, will facilitate our commercialization of diagnostic tests, including tumor classifiers and prognostic tests. Our currently marketed panels are:

• | HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay. One of the most promising areas of cancer therapy is immunotherapy or immuno-oncology, where new classes of oncology drugs are thought to enable or boost the host immune response towards tumors. Multiple drugs targeting the genes CTLA4, PD-1 and PD-L1 are on market with additional candidates moving into late-stage trials. Profiling samples for the genes targeted by these therapies may be predictive of drug response and aid in the stratification of patients into responsive and non-responsive groups. The HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay measures the expression of 549 of these immuno-oncology-associated genes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay. DLBCL tumors are frequently classified into either the activated B-cell like, or ABC, or germinal center B-cell like, or GCB, sub-types by measuring the molecular profile of the tumor. These two subtypes display different clinical pathologies, as patients with the GCB subtype of DLBCL tend to respond differently than those of the ABC sub-type. With many of the large number of new DLBCL-targeting drugs appearing to have greater efficacy in one of the sub-types, a need for a reliable, FFPE-based cell of origin classification assay has emerged. The HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay is being utilized in numerous late-stage drug programs to stratify these patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel. This RNA expression panel measures the expression of up to 2,560 genes implicated in cancer for profiling tumor tissues, analyzing cancer pathways and identifying new biomarkers across both solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms. We worked with key opinion leaders to identify the genes in this panel, which we believe is a comprehensive list of genes targeting known signaling pathways and receptor gene families implicated in cancer. Representative genes in this panel include EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4, PD-1 and FGFR. When paired with our HTG EdgeSeq microRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay (below), we provide customers with a comprehensive solution for profiling their large sample archives for novel expression signatures.

• | HTG Edge DMPK Core CYP Assay. Biopharmaceutical companies often perform DMPK profiling studies as part of the drug development process to adhere to regulatory guidance. A set of genes known as the cytochrome P450 family is known to predict both the toxicity and stability of drugs in the human body. The HTG Edge DMPK Core CYP Assay enables DMPK scientists to measure six cytochrome P450 genes recommended for in vitro pharmacokinetic studies. The DMPK area is a high-volume profiling market segment and creates synergies with down-stream clinical drug development programs.

 We utilize several alternative arrangements to sell our systems. Our platforms can be purchased directly by our customers, who also then purchase HTG EdgeSeq assays and other consumables from us on an as-needed basis. In some instances, we provide our instruments free of charge on a limited basis to facilitate customer evaluation. We also may choose to install instruments for our customers at no cost, in exchange for an agreement to purchase assays and other consumables from us at a stated price over the term of the agreement, or allow customers to rent our instrument for a monthly fee. As of December 31, 2016, we had an installed base of 47 HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq instruments (consisting of 27 systems sold, six covered under reagent rental agreements, one rental, nine evaluation units and four systems with key opinion leaders). 
 Product and Technology Pipeline Plan
 Our objective is to establish the HTG EdgeSeq system as a standard in molecular profiling, making this capability broadly accessible. We are leveraging our flexible and adaptable platform to develop comprehensive molecular profiling panels across an increasing set of molecular applications. We believe it is important to include applications that cover a broad set of genomic variation as well as expression-based clinical biomarkers to continually increase the value of the HTG EdgeSeq system and provide a more complete profiling solution for our customers. The diagram below depicts our planned expansion of systems, applications and profiling panels which are being adding in a phased approach.

Opportunities for Comprehensive Molecular Profiling in Diagnostics
 We are planning to develop a portfolio of molecular diagnostic products using our proprietary technology to provide a single, efficient testing system for sample profiling that integrates seamlessly into a customer’s NGS testing workflow. 
 We are initially focused on areas where the diagnostic testing paradigm has significant inefficiencies. For example, many leading medical institutions are shifting from a single-drug / single-test approach to a broader tumor profiling strategy for their oncology practices. Rather than testing for single mutational analyses, such as KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer, these institutions use their NGS platforms to assess the mutational status of 50 or more genes. In addition, the information a physician needs to make clinical decisions often comes from tests conducted using various testing modalities such as IHC, FISH and NGS. These complexities lead to a growing and unmet demand in clinical diagnostics for more comprehensive molecular profiles that can include RNA expression, RNA fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations and protein expression.
 We are developing solutions to address the detection and measurement of gene rearrangements such as gene fusions and insertions. A fusion gene is a hybrid gene formed from two previously separate genes. A well-established example is the EML4-ALK fusion gene found in a subset of malignant lung cancers. Our research team previously demonstrated feasibility to simultaneously detect and measure key gene fusions in lung cancer such as ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 from multiple small sample types including FFPE, cell lines and purified RNA. An insertion is the addition of one or more nucleotides into a genomic sequence; a small percentage of NSCLC exhibit HER2 exon 20 insertions. 
 We are currently developing our HTG ALKPlus Assay, or ALKPlus Assay, as our first clinical diagnostic test for the U.S. market. Our ALKPlus Assay is a comprehensive panel for lung gene rearrangements that will detect certain fusions in the following genes: ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 as well as certain insertions in HER2. This test panel is in clinical study phase and three of the four PMA modules have been submitted to the FDA. We completed the CE marking of this assay in Europe in March 2017, and expect to obtain FDA pre-market approval for the ALKPlus Assay by late 2017 or early 2018. The intended use for the ALKPlus Assay, if approved by the FDA, will be as a companion diagnostic for crizotinib therapy for ALK positive NSCLC cases. Information on the ROS1, RET, NTRK1 and HER2 gene rearrangements included in the ALKPlus Assay panel will be provided with RUO status. After obtaining the appropriate exemption(s), we believe the ROS1, RET, NTRK1 and HER2 gene rearrangements detected with the ALKPlus Assay could also be used for investigational use only, or IUO, for certain late-stage drug development trials, and, as appropriate, receive FDA approval in the future. 
 When we look at the current state of a NSCLC patient assessment, the HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay fulfills one critical part of the current diagnosis process. Other critical factors clinicians need to understand NSCLC prior to treatment are the tumor sub-type (adenocarcinoma, or ADC, squamous cell carcinoma, or SCC, neuroendocrine) and its EGFR and KRAS mutational status. A well-known U.S. cancer center recently published a peer-reviewed article showing that our technology can be used to determine whether a tumor is an ADC or SCC. In addition, we are currently developing enhancements to our chemistry, our V2 chemistry, which we believe will enable direct-sequencing of EGFR and KRAS mutations in NSCLC and other disease states. Taken together, these enhancements could, in the future, provide a single testing workflow, which we refer to as the HTG total lung solution, whereby information about the NSCLC subtype and status of clinically recognized biomarkers can be obtained in a single “multiparameter” test. 
 Ultimately, we believe that HTG technology can bring multiparameter testing to a wide variety of solid tumor sample types. We will need to develop, refine and implement new panel protocols and make changes or adjustments to our chemistry and software to optimize these planned applications and panels for use with our HTG EdgeSeq system. This will require substantial effort from our research scientists and the use of various laboratory equipment, supplies and materials, which combined represent the most significant costs that we expect to incur in connection with the development of these applications and profiling panels.   The HTG EdgeSeq system can augment or, in some cases, replace IHC testing
 IHC tests currently are integral to the diagnostic workup for most tumor types, providing qualitative protein expression data within the morphological context of the tissue tested. While there are over 400 different biomarkers tested by IHC in clinical practice today, we believe it is rare to test more than ten. This is due in part to tissue availability, especially for minimally invasive core needle biopsies, and limitations on the number of tests reimbursed per case. We are in the concept stage for an HTG EdgeSeq next generation pathology product, which is intended to enable the assessment of the RNA analogues for a clear majority of clinical IHC biomarkers in a single NGS-based test. We believe this single-test concept will provide pathologists a standard by which to measure all tumors, augmenting or in some cases replacing their IHC testing with a quantitative assessment of the tumor biology.

Serving the decentralized markets with Project JANUS
 In addition to continued menu expansion for clinical diagnostic products we have begun the development of our next generation instrument targeting the lower throughput clinical market segment. We refer to this development program as Project JANUS. We believe the lower throughput clinical market segment will potentially increase our addressable market for instrument sales from hundreds to thousands of labs. The molecular testing market is served by a mix of centralized reference laboratories, comprehensive cancer centers, and decentralized regional hospital laboratories. Volumes of particular case types and downstream testing needs for solid tumors are somewhat unpredictable for these providers. We believe Project JANUS is well suited for managing low, medium, and surge testing volumes; thus, assisting our customers with this unpredictable aspect of their businesses. We anticipate testing panels for Project JANUS to include mutations, fusions, expression classifiers and a molecular surrogate for IHC. Our approach is to serve centralized markets with the HTG EdgeSeq system and expand to the decentralized market with Project JANUS, as shown schematically in the following figure. We believe our current HTG EdgeSeq system has the throughput capabilities that match the needs of the centralized market. Project JANUS is our planned approach to expand our addressable market to the lower sample throughput labs and further decentralize the market. Due to various research and development priorities, Project JANUS development efforts were temporarily put on hold during the third quarter of 2016. We intend to resume development efforts as soon as reasonably feasible and as our V2 chemistry matures. 
 Our Technology
 
HTG Chemistries
 The qNPA chemistry used in our current HTG EdgeSeq assays reliably measures tens to thousands of messenger RNA, or mRNA, and microRNA gene expression levels from very small amounts of difficult to handle samples without the need for conducting RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, RNA amplification or RNA-labeling steps. Two primary elements of our chemistry process are DNA to RNA hybridization and S1 nuclease digestion. Both elements have been widely researched for decades and are well understood. The method is described in more detail below. 
 HTG EdgeSeq Chemistry
 Our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry is shown schematically in the following figure. Specifically, DNA nuclease protection probes, or DNA protection probes, which include a target-specific region flanked by universal wing sequences are hybridized to targeted RNAs. Target RNA can be both soluble and cross-linked in the biological matrix. Universal DNA wingmen probes are hybridized to the wings to prevent S1 nuclease digestion. S1 nuclease is added to remove single-stranded nucleic acids, including unhybridized DNA 
 12


protection probes and RNA. Following S1 nuclease treatment, the only remaining DNA protection probes in the reaction are those hybridized to targeted RNA and wingmen probes to form a hybridized complex. This produces an approximately 1:1 ratio of DNA protection probes to the RNA targeted in the sample. Alkaline hydrolysis of the hybridized complexes releases the DNA protection probes from such complexes. The released DNA protection probes are ready for quantitation. DNA protection probes are labeled with sequencing adaptors and tags in a thermocycler. The labeled DNA protection probes are concentrated, pooled, and ready for sequencing using standard NGS protocols. Data from the NGS instrument is processed and reported by the parser software provided with the HTG EdgeSeq system.
 
HTG EdgeSeq V2 Chemistry
 Like our current HTG EdgeSeq chemistry described above, our next generation V2 chemistry is based upon nuclease protection probes, which are used to protect regions of DNA and/or RNA for direct sequencing of the target. We expect to provide further details about the V2 chemistry in due course. We plan to make our V2 chemistry first available in our VERI/O laboratory, in the first half of 2017, for services such as detection of selected DNA mutations. 
 Key Advantages of HTG Chemistries
  
• | Multiplexing tens, hundreds or thousands of targets. Measuring multiple genes in a single reaction can be challenging with competitive technologies due to the complex interactions of reaction components. While we are currently marketing a panel with our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry that can profile up to 2,560 genes in a sample, we believe we can develop applications using our chemistry for multiplexing more than 2,560 genes if there is a customer need. The high level of gene multiplexing allows for significantly lower amounts of tissue to be used per sample than in competitive low-plex profiling technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No RNA extraction. Competitive technologies for assessing RNA generally require RNA that is isolated and purified from other components found in the sample. These time-consuming steps may lead to some target loss and bias the test outcome. In FFPE tissues, for example, it has been reported that a fraction of the RNA is lost in the purification process because it cannot be separated from insoluble tissue components and the fixation and embedding process or long storage times for FFPE tissue may damage the RNA and break it into smaller, more difficult to analyze fragments. This makes molecular profiling of small FFPE tissues particularly challenging and can result in testing failures and loss of precious samples due to insufficient RNA recovery. These biases introduced by RNA extraction cannot be overcome and may be magnified throughout the subsequent analysis. Our proprietary chemistry does not require RNA extraction for FFPE samples or most other sample types (we recommend extracting RNA from fresh-frozen tissue samples to prevent processing variability), improves utilization of precious samples, improving workflow and reducing costs by eliminating a step known to bias the data.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | No cDNA synthesis. Many competitive technologies, most prominently qRT-PCR and traditional RNA sequencing, require conversion of RNA into DNA for analysis. This process, called reverse transcription, requires an enzyme to move along the extracted RNA to create a DNA copy of the molecule. When damaged and fragmented RNA is used, these small RNA strands become increasingly difficult to convert into DNA in an accurate and reproducible manner. Our proprietary chemistry does not require conversion of the RNA to DNA by reverse transcription, removing a technical difficulty experienced with competitive technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Short protection probes. Many samples contain RNA degraded by various combinations of heat, age, poor processing, and fixation. In these samples, the RNA is damaged and fragmented into smaller strands. Utilizing short protection probes of 50 bases or less, our proprietary chemistry is more efficient than competitive technologies that require longer strands of RNA for quantitation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplicity. Our proprietary chemistry is simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. Compared to RT-qPCR, our chemistry does not require extraction or cDNA synthesis. Compared to traditional RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the accumulation of these steps required by other technologies results in amplification of biases, sample degradation and increased opportunities for technician error.

 HTG Chemistry and Instrument Platforms
 Our assays and instruments were developed and are manufactured under ISO 13485:2003 guidelines using our proprietary HTG EdgeSeq chemistry to simplify multiplexed nucleic acid testing in research and clinical laboratories. The entire workflow from sample preparation to a molecular profiling report can be accomplished in approximately 36 hours for 96 samples. With the speed, flexibility, sensitivity, and accuracy of our HTG platforms, combined with the system’s ability to work effectively with small sample volumes, researchers can profile tens, hundreds or thousands of different genes per sample.
 
The HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq (shown above) platforms consist of a processor, a host computer and integrated software. The processor is a fully automated instrument that prepares biological samples for quantitation using proprietary, electronically barcoded, single-use consumables. The processor has barcode scanner units to process the two-dimensional barcodes printed on the consumables loaded into the instrument. The barcoded consumables are single-use in order to reduce operator errors and provide chain of custody traceability for the samples. The robotic systems within the instrument are engineered for reliable performance and low maintenance. The walking path of the robot is programmed to minimize any chance of contamination of the reagents or samples. One host computer supports up to five processors allowing laboratories to easily expand their capacity by adding processors.
 HTG EdgeSeq applications combine either the HTG Edge processor or HTG EdgeSeq processor with an NGS platform to enable the quantitative analysis of tens, hundreds or thousands of targeted RNAs in a single panel. The sample is prepared for quantitation on the processor, then labeled with molecular sequencing adaptors and tags. The labeled samples are concentrated, pooled, and sequenced on an NGS platform using standard protocols. Data from the NGS instrument are processed and reported by the parser software included with the system. HTG EdgeSeq assays currently are available to process sample batches ranging from eight to 96.
 HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq Platform Workflow
 Our HTG platforms deliver complex molecular profiling information in a simple four step workflow. A technician spends relatively little time preparing samples which are easily loaded into the applicable processor. Once the sample is loaded, the processor 
 14


performs our proprietary chemistry protocol with no technician intervention, which is commonly referred to as walk away automation. Once the sample is processed, a technician prepares the sample for quantitation on an existing NGS instrument. This flexibility in quantifying molecular information provides customers the ability to optimize their use of the HTG Edge or HTG EdgeSeq platform based on their specific throughput, workflow and application requirements. In comparison to traditional RNA sequencing (sometimes referred to as RNA Seq), there are many fewer steps required for molecular profiling using HTG EdgeSeq applications as shown in the diagrams below.
 HTG Platform Performance
 Our HTG systems have performance characteristics that enable our customers to reproducibly, accurately and quantitatively profile from tens to thousands of genes in a single reaction using very small samples. This section provides details and examples of these performance characteristics. 
 Equivalent quantitative expression results from large as well as very small samples
 HTG EdgeSeq assays and panels are analytically validated with sample inputs ranging from as much as 25 mm2 to, in a few cases, 1.5 mm2 tumor surface area from a single 5 µm section, enabling comprehensive molecular profiling on a large surgical resection or very small needle core biopsy. Needle core biopsies are often the only tissue available for profiling of certain tumor types. A representation of the difference in the amount of tissue available in a surgical resection versus a core needle biopsy is shown graphically below (left panel). In an internal study using our HTG EdgeSeq resections versus core needle biopsies from the same non-small cell lung cancers (right panel), Pearson correlations (log2 transformed counts) greater than 0.96 were observed. These results indicate that our assay provides the same result for the two sample sizes tested. 
 

15


We believe obtaining molecular profiles from very small samples is of critical importance to our customers. We have demonstrated reproducible, quantitative results from a fraction of the more than 100 ng of input RNA typically required for competitive technologies. In the study shown below, the HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel was used to measure mRNA expression levels in a dilution series from 12.5 ng to 1.56 ng of Universal Human RNA. In the figure titled Input Titration Correlations below, correlations between each dilution were measured by Pearson’s r and are displayed in each comparison field. A Pearson correlation between two perfectly identical molecular profiles will produce an r-value of 1.0. The r-values obtained in the study shown below, of greater than 0.99, indicate nearly identical molecular profiles were obtained throughout the dilution series. In the figure titled Assay Linearity below, the raw number of sequencing reads for each of the samples in the dilution series are shown, with the statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line, R-squared, of 0.98481. These plots demonstrate the capability of the HTG EdgeSeq applications on the HTG Edge or HTG EdgeSeq platform to deliver equivalent molecular profiles over a range of sample inputs. 
 
 16


Leveraging the dynamic range and sensitivity of NGS
 The end product of the HTG EdgeSeq assay is a library of DNA probes that, once sequenced, are compared to a reference database consisting of the sequences of the probes used in the assay. NGS platforms sequence each nucleotide of each DNA probe in the library to produce highly specific information about each such probe. Each nucleotide sequenced is stored as a single read. With the capacity of a single sequencing run numbering in the millions of reads, NGS platforms are highly sensitive, capable of detecting low abundance or rare sequences, while having a wide dynamic range, accurately counting the relative number of abundant sequences. In the development and validation of gene expression assays, we believe it is important that the applicable assay reliably measure differential gene expression for both high and low abundance genes. As an example of how the HTG EdgeSeq system leverages the sensitivity of NGS, the graphic below shows the relative expression of the low-abundance immunotherapy targeted genes PD-1 and PD-L1 across a wide range of sample inputs using the HTG EdgeSeq DLBCL Cell of Origin Assay.
 
High fidelity between processing conditions
 One of the greatest challenges faced in molecular profiling of formalin fixed samples is the poor fidelity routinely seen when comparing the results across various processing conditions. One example is the lack of fidelity seen between formalin fixed samples, such as FFPE, to non-fixed tissue. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the fixation process can lead to different molecular profiles in otherwise identical samples. We believe researchers often obtain sub-optimal molecular profiling results solely due to the formalin fixation process. We further believe that our chemistry overcomes the losses in fidelity between non-fixed and FFPE tissues, enabling users to obtain an accurate assessment of tumor biology from FFPE tissues.  
 17


To demonstrate fidelity between non-fixed and FFPE tissues that may be achieved using the HTG EdgeSeq system, a resection from a breast cancer tumor was prospectively collected and split, with half of the specimen immediately frozen and the other formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. RNA from the non-fixed, fresh frozen specimen was extracted and added to the HTG lysis buffer (we recommend extracting the RNA from fresh tissue samples to prevent processing variability). The matched FFPE tissue was directly lysed in the HTG lysis buffer without extraction. Both specimens were then profiled using the HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay. The scatterplot below shows the correlation between the non-fixed, fresh frozen tissue and the FFPE tissue, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.95, indicating that our proprietary chemistry produces the same result regardless of whether or not a sample is fresh or fixed. We believe our system enables researchers and clinicians to access their large collections of archived FFPE tissues to deliver reproducible, biologically relevant molecular profiles.
 

Compatibility with multiple sample types
 We believe our proprietary chemistry is robust across many biological sample types. Below are technical replicates of heart FFPE, plasma and whole blood preserved in PAXgene profiled using the HTG EdgeSeq microRNA Whole-Transcriptome Assay. As shown by the high correlations, our customers can expect the same result from a sample run after run.  
 

Detection of gene fusions
 In feasibility studies, HTG EdgeSeq chemistry has demonstrated the ability to accurately detect gene rearrangements in patient-derived FFPE tissues. The example below demonstrates detection in a patient sample with a characterized gene fusion involving the KIF5B and RETS genes. Using multiple DNA protection probes, the HTG EdgeSeq system can detect gene rearrangements such as fusions. We are developing an assay that allows gene fusions to be detected in two ways. First is the direct measurement and detection of the unique RNA sequence created at the gene fusion site. This is indicated by the strong signal obtained from the KIF5B-RET v1 probe in the following graph. The second approach involves calculating the ratio of signals obtained from probes targeting both the 5’ and 3’ end of the RET gene. Samples which do not contain a RET gene fusion will have similar RET 5’ and RET 3’ expression. In the 
 18


sample above, however, which contains a RET gene fusion as indicated by the fusion-junction specific prove, we see significantly higher signal from the RET 3’ probe implying the two parts of the RET gene are no longer connected, indicating a gene rearrangement has occurred.
 
A cell line with a known ALK gene fusion and normal (or wild-type) ROS1 gene was tested using the same 5’ and 3’ probe ratio methodology described for the RET fusion above. As expected with a fused ALK gene, the expression of the 3’ portion of the transcript is much higher than the 5’ portion, indicating a fusion event has occurred. An example of a known non-fusion gene, ROS1, is also shown in the example where the 5’ and 3’ ends of the ROS1 are expressed at a 1:1 ratio, indicating this gene has not undergone a fusion event.
 

19


Discriminating between closely related sequences
 The specificity of our proprietary chemistry is demonstrated in the data chart below. Closely related synthetic miRNA pools supplied by Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities were split between pools. All possible probes were used to profile individual pools. As shown in the following graphs, from 3-11% of NPP probes bound to off-target sequences with a 1-base difference (right graph) while only 0.1-0.3% of NPP probes bound to off-target sequences with a 2-base difference (left graph). In both examples, the on-target hybridization signal is at least 8X greater than off-target hybridization. Data was generated using the Illumina MiSeq v2 1x50 reagent kit. We believe that our proprietary chemistry is highly specific and will enable our customers to discriminate between closely related sequences.
 
Repeatability
 An important consideration in adoption of a molecular profiling platform is the degree to which the same molecular profile can be obtained from a sample tested on multiple replicates and multiple occasions. Obtaining highly similar profiles indicates that the panel is stable, and that the data generated is reliable and repeatable. The XY scatterplots below show the correlation between the same sample on technical replicates using the HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay. Extremely similar results were obtained, as demonstrated by the Pearson correlation coefficient r-values of 0.96 and 0.97 for fresh frozen and FFPE samples, respectively. We believe the HTG EdgeSeq system enables our customers to produce stable and repeatable molecular profiles. As demonstrated by the measurement of 549 mRNAs in the sample, HTG EdgeSeq chemistry has the ability to reliably detect large numbers of genes in a complex background.
20



Reproducibility
 Another important consideration in adoption of a molecular profiling platform is the degree to which the same molecular profile can be obtained from a single sample tested multiple times over on the same and different instruments. Obtaining highly similar profiles indicates that the chemistry and instrument platform is stable, and that the data generated is reliable and reproducible. The XY scatterplots below show the correlation between the same sample profiles on three separate instruments across three days using the HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel. The scale of the vertical and horizontal axes represent log 2 transformed, filtered probe counts. Extremely similar results were obtained, as demonstrated by the Pearson r-values above 0.96 for all comparisons. We believe the HTG EdgeSeq platform and HTG EdgeSeq chemistry enables our customers to produce stable and reproducible molecular profiles.
Research and Development
 We have committed, and expect to commit, significant resources to developing new technologies and products, improving product performance and reliability and reducing costs. We have assembled an experienced research and development team with the scientific, engineering, software and process talent that we believe is required to successfully grow our business. As of December 31, 2016, our research and development team consisted of 21 employees across the disciplines of research and development scientist, platform development and bioinformatics.
 As discussed in more detail above, in addition to an ongoing focus on the expansion of our profiling applications and test panel menu, in 2016 we began the development of the next generation of our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry, or V2 chemistry, which will allow targeted, direct sequencing of RNA and DNA. Applications of the V2 chemistry are likely to include mutation detection, expressed mutation detection, expression measurements and co-detection of RNA and DNA from FFPE tissue.  
 21


We have also begun the development of our next generation Project JANUS instrument program. External development efforts for Project JANUS with Invetech PTY, Ltd. were temporarily put on hold in mid-2016, but are expected to resume in the near future as our V2 DNA chemistry matures. 
 We incurred research and development expenses of $7.9 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Sales and Marketing
 We distribute our instruments and consumables via direct sales in the United States and Europe and also through distributors in parts of Europe and other countries. As of December 31, 2016, our U.S. sales and marketing organization consisted of 33 employees including 11 in direct sales or sales management, 15 in sales support and seven in marketing. In addition to our direct sales team in the United States, as of December 31, 2016, we had three direct sales and support employees in Europe and distribution agreements in several additional countries. This sales model provides us with direct sales coverage in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the Nordic countries, and distributors in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Israel.   
 Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at biopharmaceutical companies, clinical research centers and clinical diagnostic labs focused on sample profiling for translational research, biomarker/companion assay development and lab-developed diagnostic testing. We intend to promote adoption of our HTG EdgeSeq system, sample profiling panels and future molecular diagnostic assays, upon marketing clearance or approval by FDA by expanding our U.S. sales force, building a greater direct sales presence in Europe, expanding international distribution, and continuing to collaborate with key opinion leaders to validate our platform and influence utilization of our products.
 The top two customers accounted for 29% and 12% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 38% and 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015. We derived 0% and 8% of our total revenue from grants and contracts primarily from one organization during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Manufacturing and Suppliers
 We primarily perform manufacturing and final acceptance testing in house. External resources are leveraged for their specific expertise in either producing components for our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq instruments and raw materials for our consumables in accordance with our designs, or based on their catalog products which are utilized as is within our designs. We manufacture HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq instruments and reagent kits at our Tucson, Arizona facility, which has been certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards. We completed capital improvements in 2016, which created over 6,500 square feet of dedicated manufacturing and operations space. We believe that our existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our needs at least for the next several years. 
Instruments
 We assemble our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq instruments at our Tucson, Arizona facility. We have qualified an alternative third-party manufacturer for our instruments and we believe additional instrument manufacturing alternatives would be available if necessary. Instrument component vendors are qualified and reviewed regularly to ensure that manufacturing standards are met and maintained. We award contracts for estimated annual quantities of components and, considering the replenishment lead times of our vendors, take delivery of batches covering approximately one month of demand at a time. 
Consumables
 We assemble our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq consumables at our Tucson, Arizona facility. Raw material vendors are selected using precise standards, and are reviewed regularly for compliance with our specific quality requirements. We purchase raw material stock in quantities that often exceed projected annual demand. We complete batches of finished goods approximating quarterly demand and supervise inventory on a minimum/maximum basis to ensure that we are replenishing our finished goods and raw material ahead of demand.

 While we believe that we compete favorably based on the factors described above, many of our competitors are more highly capitalized and/or have been in existence for a longer period, and enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:
  
• | Greater name and brand recognition, financial and human resources;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broader product lines;
--+-----------------------


• | Larger sales forces and more established distributor networks;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Substantial intellectual property portfolios;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Larger and more established customer bases and relationships; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Better established, larger scale and lower cost manufacturing capabilities.

Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain intellectual property rights relating to key aspects of the technology employed in our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms and assays, maintain any strategic licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely upon certain patents, registered and common law trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, invention and patent assignment agreements and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We intend to aggressively protect, defend and extend the intellectual property rights in our technology.
Patents and Patent Applications
 As of December 31, 2016, our patent portfolio included 13 patent families that, collectively, consisted of nine issued U.S. patents, 37 granted foreign patents (variously in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom), and 28 patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. This portfolio is directed to our nuclease-protection-based technologies as well as to lung cancer and melanoma biomarker panels and a DLBCL cell-of-origin classifier discovered using our nuclease-protection-based technology, which will help us maintain an exclusive position in key areas of our business, including targeted nuclease-protection based sequencing, and, if we should so elect, may provide opportunities for out-licensing melanoma, DLBCL, or lung-cancer-related content. There were two pending applications and 10 granted patents, including one U.S. patent, directed to our novel HTG EdgeSeq methods in the portfolio as of December 31, 2016. The HTG EdgeSeq method patents will expire in April 2032. The portfolio also included two pending applications directed to our V2 HTG EdgeSeq methods as of December 31, 2016. Worldwide, as of December 31, 2016, we had 21 patents in the two patent families directed to our HTG Edge plate-based methods; these patents will begin to expire at the end of December 2017 with the last ones expiring in June 2022.
Agreements with Third Parties
 Asset Purchase Agreement with NuvoGen Research, LLC
 We entered an asset purchase agreement dated January 9, 2001, as amended in November 2003, September 2004, November 2012 and February 2014, with NuvoGen to acquire certain intellectual property from NuvoGen. The acquired technology generally relates to our array-based nuclease protection panels. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the acquired technology, we initially paid NuvoGen 5,587 shares of our common stock, fixed payments of $740,000 over the first two years of the agreement and agreed to pay NuvoGen 6% our yearly revenue, which would be applied to any fixed payments, until the total aggregate cash compensation paid to NuvoGen under the agreement equals $15,000,000. Pursuant to the latest amendment to the agreement, through 2017, we are only required to pay a yearly fixed fee, in quarterly installments, to NuvoGen of $800,000, and may defer any accrued revenue-based payments. Beginning in 2018, we are obligated to pay the greater of $400,000 or 6% of sales, plus amounts, if any, deferred in the 2017 period by which 6% of revenue exceeds the applicable fixed fee plus 5% interest on such deferred amounts until the obligation is repaid in full. We paid our fixed fees for 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 in advance, and resumed making quarterly payments in April 2016. No revenue-based payments were deferred in 2016. 
 In a transaction related to the foregoing acquisition, NuvoGen also received a non-exclusive, royalty free license under the acquired technology pursuant to an agreement dated September 15, 2004. The license is limited to NuvoGen’s own internal service-oriented efforts and activities to accelerate the development of targeted drugs and other pharmaceutical compounds and agents as part of NuvoGen’s grant funded or other basic research and development of drugs intended for the treatment of cancer. Pursuant to the agreement, if NuvoGen produces revenue through the sale of cancer drugs developed through use of the license for entities other than for-profit and other commercial drug-research and development service ventures, NuvoGen will pay us a royalty in the mid-single digit range percentage of such revenue for the quarter. This agreement may be terminated by either party in case of a breach by the other party, and we may terminate the agreement by giving written notice if NuvoGen files for bankruptcy or performs other similar actions.
 License Agreement with Merck
 In connection with the investment by Merck Capital Ventures LLC in the Company, we granted to Merck Sharpe & Dohme, or Merck, pursuant to an agreement dated February 15, 2011, a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicenseable (except to affiliates of Merck) license to certain of our qNPA patent rights solely for Merck’s internal research and development purposes. We may terminate the agreement upon a breach of any material provision of the agreement by Merck, if Merck has not cured such breach within 60 days after receiving written notice from us.

Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford Finance, LLC and Silicon Valley Bank
 On August 22, 2014, we entered a Loan and Security Agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, as collateral agent, or in such capacity, Agent, and a lender and Silicon Valley Bank, as a lender, or SVB, and together with Oxford, the Lenders, providing for up to two separate term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 million.
 We borrowed the initial term loan in the principal amount of $11.0 million, or Term Loan A, on August 22, 2014. Term Loan A bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.50% per annum. On or prior to June 30, 2015, the Loan Agreement allowed us to borrow one additional term loan, or Term Loan B, for up to $5.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain borrowing conditions. We received the Term Loan A proceeds, net of a $320,000 original issue discount, with a requirement to pay a final payment of 3.75% of the total amount borrowed.
 In August 2015, the Company and its lenders amended the Loan Agreement to extend the availability of Term Loan B until March 31, 2016. Pursuant to the August 2015 amendment to the Loan Agreement, we made monthly interest-only payments until April 1, 2016. Following the interest-only payment period, equal monthly payments consisting of principal and interest amortized over the remaining term of the loan through the September 1, 2018 maturity date are due. The amendment also increased the final fee payment percentage to 4.75%. In February 2016, the Company notified its lenders, pursuant to the requirements of the amendment to the Loan Agreement, of its intention to draw the remaining $5.0 million available under Term Loan B. This additional principal will be repaid evenly over the course of 30 months beginning April 1, 2016 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.75%. The final fee premium relating to Term Loan B of $237,500 is being amortized to interest expense, using the effective interest method, over the term of Term Loan B.
 We may prepay all, but not less than all, of the loaned amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the prepayment date with 15 days’ notice to Oxford. In accordance with the August 2015 amendment, we will be obligated to pay a prepayment fee equal to (i) 2% of the principal amount repaid if the loan is prepaid after the first anniversary but on or prior to the second anniversary of the August 2015 amendment and (ii) 1% of the principal amount repaid if the loan is repaid after the second anniversary of the August 2015 amendment and prior to maturity. We are not entitled to reborrow any amounts of principal once such principal has been repaid. The agreement was again amended in June 2016 to modify the definitions of permitted indebtedness and permitted liens to provide for an increased maximum amount of permitted indebtedness, authorize a new category of permitted indebtedness and authorize a new category of permitted liens. 
 While any amounts are outstanding under the credit facility, we are subject to several affirmative and restrictive covenants, including covenants regarding delivery of financial statements, maintenance of inventory, payment of taxes, maintenance of insurance, dispositions of property, business combinations or acquisitions, incurrence of additional indebtedness and transactions with affiliates, among other customary covenants. We are also restricted from paying cash dividends or making other distributions or payments on our capital stock except for repurchases of stock pursuant to employee stock purchase plans, employee restricted stock agreements, stockholder rights plans, director or consultant stock option plans, or similar plans, provided such repurchases do not exceed $100,000 in the aggregate per fiscal year.
 We granted the Agent a security interest in our personal property to secure our obligations under the loan agreement. The security interest does not extend to patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights (except for rights to payment related to the sale, licensing or disposition of such intellectual property rights) or certain other specified property. If we default under our term loan, our lenders could foreclose on our assets, including substantially all of our cash, which is held in accounts with our lenders. 
 Upon the occurrence of certain events, including but not limited to the failure by us to satisfy our payment obligations under the loan agreement, the breach of certain of our other covenants under the loan agreement, and the occurrence of a material adverse change, the Agent will have the right, among other remedies, to declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable, and will have the right to receive the final payment fee and, if the payment of principal and interest is due prior to maturity, a prepayment fee. The Agent also will have the right, among other remedies, to foreclose upon and/or sell or otherwise liquidate our personal property upon the occurrence of certain events.
 In connection with Term Loan A, we granted each of the Lenders warrants to purchase 1,256,281 shares of the Company’s Series E Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $0.2189 per share. The warrants are exercisable until August 22, 2024 and were automatically converted to warrants for common stock upon completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, in May 2015. In connection with the funding of Term Loan B, in March 2016, we issued Oxford a common stock warrant exercisable for 45,307 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.759 per share, and the warrant previously issued to SVB automatically became exercisable for an additional 5,317 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $23.51 per share in accordance with the Loan Agreement. 
 25


Development and Component Supply Agreement with Illumina, Inc.
 In October 2014, we entered a development and component supply agreement with Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, for the development and worldwide commercialization by us of up to two complete diagnostic gene expression profiling tests for use with Illumina’s diagnostic instruments, using components supplied by Illumina. We refer to these diagnostic gene expression profiling tests as in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, test kits or assays. The IVD test kits may be used in two discrete testing fields chosen by us, one or both of which may relate to oncology for breast, lung, lymphoma or melanoma tumors, and up to one of which may relate to transplant, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or immunology/autoimmunity. We provided notice to Illumina of our first testing selection during the quarter ended March 31, 2015. We are in discussions with Illumina regarding, among other things, a potential extension of the original October 2016 deadline to select a second field. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2015, we and Illumina agreed to a development plan for the development and regulatory approval of the selected IVD test kit, following which we paid Illumina a $100,000 fee. Illumina has agreed to provide development and regulatory support as part of the plan, which relates to our HTG EdgeSeq ALKPlus Assay, now in development. We are also required to pay Illumina up to $1.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones relating to the IVD test kits. In addition, we have agreed to pay Illumina a single digit percentage royalty on net sales of any IVD test kits that we commercialize pursuant to the agreement. Ongoing research and development costs for these programs have been expensed as incurred. 
 Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to obtain our requirements for certain components to be used in the development and/or commercialization of IVD test kits from Illumina. We and Illumina have also agreed to negotiate in good faith to enter into a supplemental supply agreement for the continued purchase and supply of the foregoing components.
 Absent earlier termination, the agreement will expire in October 2019 or on the date which the last to expire development plan under the agreement is completed, whichever is earlier. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days’ written notice and may terminate any development plan under the agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice. Illumina may terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice if we undergo certain changes of control or immediately if we fail to select a testing field for an IVD test kit within 24 months following the date of the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach of the agreement that remains uncured for 30 days, or upon the other party’s bankruptcy.
 Authorization, Supply and Regulatory Authorization Agreement with Life Technologies Corporation
 In March 2016, we entered an Authorization, Supply and Regulation Authorization Agreement with Life Technologies Corporation, or LTC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., for the development and worldwide commercialization by us of up to five RNA-based NGS panels, or HTG Assays, for use with LTC’s sequencing instruments and components supplied to end‑users by LTC. 
 Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to obtain our requirements for certain components to be used in the development of HTG Assays from LTC. In March 2016, we purchased approximately $250,000 of LTC products and equipment in accordance with this agreement. LTC has agreed to provide support in our efforts to obtain regulatory approval of the HTG Assays. We are required to pay LTC a milestone payment in the mid-six figure dollar range upon certain regulatory achievements for each HTG Assay. In addition, we have agreed to pay LTC a single digit percentage royalty on net sales of HTG Assays that we commercialize pursuant to the agreement. No milestone or royalty payments have been accrued or made pursuant to this agreement as of December 31, 2016. 
 Absent early termination, the initial term of the agreement will expire in March 2021 and thereafter will automatically renew for additional two year periods for as long as we continue to develop or sell HTG Assays, provided that neither party provides written notice of its election to terminate the agreement at least 60 days prior to expiration of the then-current term. Either party may terminate the agreement (a) upon the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 30 days, (b) upon the other party’s bankruptcy or (c) upon written notice in the event the party providing notice reasonably determines that continued performance under the agreement may violate any regulatory law, or any other applicable law or regulation or FDA guidance.
 Bristol-Myers Squibb Agreement 
 In May 2016, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for the development, in collaboration with BMS, of two custom assays based on our HTG EdgeSeq technology. Following development of each custom assay, at BMS’s request, we may also perform sample processing services using such custom assay(s) and/or supply the custom assay(s) to BMS or its third-party subcontractors. Additional custom assay development related to immuno-oncology research may be undertaken pursuant to the agreement in accordance with a mutually acceptable work plan, which is incorporated by written amendment.  
 26


BMS paid an initial non-refundable, non-creditable program set-up fee, and has agreed to pay an annual non-refundable, non-creditable project management fee in quarterly installments, as well as a fee for each custom assay developed. Each such fee was or is in the low six-figure range. At BMS’s request, we will supply custom assay kits and perform sample processing services. 
 The agreement will expire on May 11, 2019 or, if a project is then ongoing, the date of delivery of the final report for such project. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach or default in the performance of a material obligation under the agreement or if certain warranties or representations are untrue in any material respect, either a Default, and such Default remains uncured for 60 days or such longer period if the Default cannot be cured within 60 days. BMS may terminate a project upon 90 days’ prior written notice. 
 Merck KGaA Agreement 
 In October 2016, we entered a Master CDx Agreement, or master agreement, with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, or Merck KGaA to serve as the basis for one or more project agreements to develop, seek regulatory approval for, and commercialize companion diagnostics for Merck KGaA drug candidates and corresponding therapeutics. Concurrently, we entered into a first project agreement under the master agreement concerning our sequencing-based DLBCL cell of origin assay, or DLBCL Assay and Merck KGaA’s investigational drug, M7583, or Project.
 The Project has three stages aligned with timelines and outcomes of M7583 development. During stages 1 and 2, we will perform specified DLBCL Assay development activities. In stage 3, we will obtain applicable regulatory approvals on the DLBCL Assay and make it commercially available in the United States and certain other jurisdictions.
 Stages 2 and 3 each have an up-front payment, and all stages of the Project have milestone-based payments. We are eligible to receive up to a total of $9,900,000 over a period of approximately nine years in fixed or determinable contract consideration comprising up-front and milestone payments. In addition, during stages 1 and 2 of the Project, we will sell DLBCL Assay kits and/or perform sample processing services upon request of, and as instructed by, Merck KGaA. 
 Merck KGaA may terminate the Project by providing 90 days’ prior written notice, at which point Merck KGaA will reimburse us for costs incurred during the termination period, of an amount not to exceed non-cancellable, non-reimbursable expenses, and we will reimburse Merck KGaA for any costs that have been prepaid without being incurred prior to termination. Further, either party may also terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 45 days or upon the other party’s bankruptcy. 
 QIAGEN Agreement
 In November 2016, we entered a Master Assay Development, Commercialization and Manufacturing Agreement, or Governing Agreement, with QIAGEN Manchester Limited, or QML, a wholly owned subsidiary of QIAGEN N.V. The Governing Agreement creates a framework for the companies to combine their technological and commercial strengths to offer biopharmaceutical companies a complete NGS-based solution for the development, manufacture and commercialization of companion diagnostic assays. Under the Governing Agreement, the parties will jointly seek companion diagnostic programs with biopharmaceutical companies, QML will contract with interested biopharmaceutical companies for specified projects, each a Project, and the companies will enter into a statement of work under the Governing Agreement, which sets forth the rights and obligations of each party with respect to each Project. 
 The parties’ relationship under the Governing Agreement is exclusive in the oncology field. Such exclusivity in the oncology field may be lost and become non-exclusive if certain performance targets are not met. Projects may be undertaken in non-oncology fields at each party’s discretion on a non-exclusive basis.   
 The companies will share net profits under each statement of work, based on whether development of particular assays under a statement of work are primarily based on each company’s intellectual property. Each statement of work will provide additional financial terms for the corresponding Project, which terms will depend on the respective development and/or commercialization activities of the parties. 
 The Governing Agreement will continue for a five-year term. However, either party may terminate the agreement upon (i) the other party’s uncured material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency, (ii) specified events affecting all statements of work, or (iii) a change of control by either party. In the event a party terminates the Governing Agreement for its own change of control, a $2.0 million termination payment will be payable to the non-terminating party. 
 27


Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, entered concurrent with the Governing Agreement, QIAGEN North American Holdings, Inc., or QNAH, another wholly owned subsidiary of QIAGEN N.V., purchased 833,333 shares of our common stock on November 17, 2016 at $2.40 per share, for a total purchase price of $2.0 million. QNAH agreed to purchase up to an additional $2.0 million of our common stock (subject to any applicable limitations under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market) upon the sale by the Company of at least $12.0 million of common or preferred stock in a financing transaction that occurs prior to May 16, 2017, or such other mutually agreeable date, or a Qualified Financing. The price per share payable by QNAH in a second tranche purchase will be equal to the price per share at which shares are sold in a Qualified Financing. 
 Trade Secrets
 We also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that we have entered into such agreements with all relevant parties, or that these parties will abide by the terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy or commercially exploit aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
 For additional information relating to the risks associated with our intellectual property position see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.”
 Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 Clinical laboratories will acquire our instrumentation through a capital purchase, capital lease or reagent purchasing agreement. These laboratories will offer their customers a menu of testing services using our IVD test kits or their LDTs, which they may develop using components they purchase from us, or a combination of both. Our customers will generate revenue for these testing services by collecting payments from third-party payors, including public and private payors, as well as patient co-payments.
 United States
 In the United States, our customers will utilize the existing reimbursement framework for testing services: Tier 1 and Tier 2 Molecular Pathology Procedures
 Prior to January 1, 2013, molecular pathology procedures were reimbursed using the 83890-83912 code series, commonly known as “stacking codes”, which were based on the various technical steps performed to produce a test result. The American Medical Association, or AMA, created the Tier 1 codes (81200-81383) and Tier 2 codes (81400-81408) to specifically identify the test being performed and as a replacement to stacking codes. The stacking codes were deleted from the clinical laboratory fee schedule used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for payment determination in 2013. Single analyte tests for mutations and gene rearrangements are described by these Tier 1 and Tier 2 codes; specific examples include 81235 for epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, mutation analysis and 81401 for EML4/ALK rearrangement analysis. Single analyte tests not specifically called out in Tier 1 or Tier 2 codes can be submitted for reimbursement consideration using the miscellaneous code 81479.
Genomic Sequencing Procedures.
 The AMA created codes for Genomic Sequencing Procedures, or GSPs, and other Molecular Multianalyte Assays as part of its calendar year 2015 update to the clinical laboratory fee schedule. AMA has since modified the GSP codes to clarify the definition to include DNA and RNA. Our customers may use these codes to seek reimbursement for diagnostic multi-analyte test offerings, such as:

• | Gene expression classifiers for hematolymphoid neoplasms, such as the determination of activated B-cell like, or ABC, or germinal center B-cell like, or GCB, subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gene rearrangements in solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutations in solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 Payments for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Molecular Pathology Procedures and GSPs may be sought from both public and private payors. Claims for Medicare coverage are processed by private Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, such as Novitas and Cahaba, and coverage for specific test codes are specified in Local Coverage Determinations, or LCDs, issued by individual MACs or National Coverage Determinations, or NCDs, which apply to all MACs. Private payors issue their own coverage determinations that are largely 
 28


reflective of the CMS LCDs and NCDs. HTG closely monitors trends in coverage through interactions with customers, industry associations such as the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, and the Association for Molecular Pathology, or AMP, and industry consultants; these trends are key considerations in our product development plans.
 Our customers may use our products, subject to regulatory limitations, to offer testing services that provide an analysis of 5‑50 genes as well as 51 or more genes. In October 2014, CMS released its preliminary determinations regarding the method for determining 2015 payment rates for new codes under the clinical laboratory fee schedule. CMS recommended that payment rates for GSPs be determined through a process known as gapfill rather than by crosswalking to allow CMS and its contractors to gather information about the manner in which the tests are performed and the resources necessary to provide them, so that ultimately CMS can set an appropriate payment rate for these tests. In the gapfill process, the local MACs determine the appropriate fee schedule amounts in the first year, and CMS calculates a national payment rate based on the median of these local fee schedule amounts in the second year. On September 27, 2015, gapfill pricing for CPTs 81445 and 81450 for the assessment of 5-50 genes in solid and liquid tumors, respectively, were set at $597 and $648, respectively, and remains the same as of December 31, 2016. CPT 81455 for the assessment of 51 or more genes in solid and liquid tumors has not yet been priced.  
 We believe that establishment of the aforementioned reimbursement codes specific to genomic sequencing procedures such as our clinical diagnostic tests currently in development is an important factor in expanding access to our products. In addition, coverage and reimbursement of our clinical diagnostic tests by government and private payors is essential to our commercial success. Accordingly, our strategy includes efforts to encourage third-party payors to establish coverage, coding and payment that will facilitate access to our tests as we seek FDA approval for these tests and expand our commercialization efforts in the United States. Our success in these efforts depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for tests using our technology. Failure by our customers who use our tests to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from healthcare payors or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ policies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects.
 In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments made under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, with amounts assigned to the procedure billing codes used to report the specific laboratory services. The CLFS sets the maximum amount payable under Medicare for each billing code. Payment under the CLFS has been limited from year-to-year by Congressional action such as imposition of national limitation amounts and freezes on the otherwise applicable annual consumer price index updates. In February 2012, the Middle-Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 was signed into law which, in part, reduced the potential future cost-based increases to the CLFS by 2%. The payment amounts under the CLFS are important not only for Medicare reimbursement, but also because although there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement amongst third-party payors, other third-party payors are often guided by the Medicare CLFS in establishing reimbursement rates. For example, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients. Because of the anticipated reduction in the CLFS payment amounts, certain third party payors may also reduce reimbursement amounts.
 Beginning January 1, 2016, there will also be major changes to the payment formula under the CLFS. Under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which was signed to law in April 2014, clinical laboratories must report laboratory test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic lab test that it furnishes during a time period to be defined by future regulations. The reported data must include the payment rate (reflecting all discounts, rebates, coupons and other price concessions) and the volume of each test that was paid by each private payor (including health insurance issuers, group health plans, Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid managed care organizations). Beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test will be equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period. The payment rate will apply to laboratory tests furnished by a hospital laboratory if the test is separately paid under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system.
 Outside the United States
 Our target markets outside of the United States are Europe and Asia/Pacific. Our diagnostic product menu plans for Europe and Asia/Pacific consist primarily of NGS‑based test kits that will satisfy existing or emerging testing demand, and we expect to be competing based on testing efficiency, quality and price. 
 In Europe, coverage for molecular diagnostic testing is varied. Countries with statutory health insurance (e.g., Germany, France, The Netherlands) tend to be more progressive in technology adoption with favorable reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing. In countries such as the United Kingdom with tax-based insurance, adoption and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing is not uniform and is influenced by local budgets.
 29


In Asia/Pacific, our commercial strategy is to opportunistically partner with distributors in countries with sufficient demand for our products to justify the investment by both parties. 
 Our diagnostic product menu plans for Europe and Asia/Pacific consist primarily of NGS-based test kits that will satisfy existing or emerging testing demand, and we will be competing based on testing efficiency, quality and price. We plan to seek partners knowledgeable in local molecular diagnostic testing reimbursement practices and, working co‑operatively with such partners, prepare, to the extent feasible, favorable reimbursement treatment for our diagnostic products in the applicable Asia/Pacific markets. Preferably, such favorable reimbursement decisions will coincide with or precede the launch of each applicable diagnostic product.
 Failure by our ex-U.S. customers to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our diagnostic products from healthcare payors or adverse changes in government and private payors’ policies would have a material adverse effect on our ex-U.S. growth prospects and our overall business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Government Regulation – Medical Device Regulations
 United States
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Currently we are limited to marketing our products for research use only, which means that we cannot make any diagnostic or clinical claims. However, we intend to seek regulatory clearances or approvals in the United States and other jurisdictions to market certain assays for diagnostic purposes. The clinical diagnostics under development by HTG are classified as “medical devices” under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of such products for their intended use.
 Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA submission can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
 Device Classification
 Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
 Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
 Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and post market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to either:
  
• | a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
 30


After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements.
 The PMA Process
 If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
 Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally costlier and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical study data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
 In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical studies intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and Institutional Review Board approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical studies. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical studies for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical study sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical studies, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
 Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If the PMA application is determined to be sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g. major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a 
 31


PMA, an FDA advisory panel may be convened to review the PMA and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. This advisory panel may also involve a public meeting if FDA determines public input is required. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical study data and clinical study sites, and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
  
• | the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical studies may be insufficient to support approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, which usually contains several conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional analytical studies or clinical studies are necessary, in which case approval of the PMA submission may be delayed for several months or years while the analytical studies and/or trials are conducted and data are submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
 New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
 In approving a PMA application, the FDA may also require some form of post market studies or post market surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for several years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. FDA may also require post market surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:
  
• | the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow elaborate design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advertising and promotion requirements;
--+----------------------------------------


• | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | PMA annual reporting requirements;
--+-----------------------------------


• | the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 32


 
• | medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an order of repair, replacement or refund;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | device tracking requirements; and
--+----------------------------------


• | post approval study and post market surveillance requirements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
 Research Use Only
 A research use only, or RUO, product is one that is not intended for clinical diagnostic use and must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for research use only and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA requirements discussed above, including the approval or clearance and QSR requirements. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use.
European Union
 The European Union, or EU, has also adopted requirements that affect our products. These requirements include establishing standards that address creating a certified quality system as well as several directives that address specific product areas. The most significant of these directives is the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive, or IVDD, which includes:

• | Essential Requirements. The IVDD specifies “essential requirements” that all medical devices must meet. The requirements are similar to those adopted by the FDA relating to quality systems and product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conformity Assessment. Unlike United States regulations, which require virtually all devices to undergo some level of premarket review by the FDA, the IVDD currently allows manufacturers to bring many devices to market using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the essential requirements for that device. A small number of products must go through a more formal pre-market review process. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the EU and European Economic Area.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vigilance. The IVDD also specifies requirements for post market reporting similar to those adopted by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other International
 Several other countries, including Australia, Canada, China and Japan, have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for medical devices sold in those countries. Many of these standards are loosely patterned after those adopted by the European Union, but with elements unique to each country. Although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards, regulations in each country may vary substantially, which can affect timelines of introduction. We routinely monitor these developments and address compliance with the various country requirements as new standards are adopted.
Government Regulation – Fraud and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulation
 We may be subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback laws. Penalties for violations of these healthcare laws include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, 
 33


additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
 Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending, any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value.
 There are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the intent to induce referrals need only be “one purpose” of the remuneration for violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below.
Federal Civil False Claims Act
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by the Federal Government. Suits filed under the federal civil False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers”, may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a case brought under the federal civil False Claim Act. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Many comparable state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the Federal Government.
Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition
 We are also subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits, among other things, physicians who have a financial relationship, including an investment, ownership or compensation relationship with an entity, from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to the entity for designated health services, which include clinical laboratory services, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare, Medicaid or any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all third-party payors, not just Medicare and Medicaid.
Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
 The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person or entity who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 34


Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
 The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Among other things, HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act
 The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians, as defined above, and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for “knowing failures.” 
State Law Equivalents
 Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with health care professionals and entities, and require us to track and report payments and other transfers of value, including consulting fees, provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws. We also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country. We may be subject to certain state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the ACA, which is substantially changing healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and is significantly impacting the medical device industry. The ACA’s provisions of importance to our business include, but are not limited to, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, which became effective January 1, 2013. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, signed into law in December 2015, includes a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax that applies between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Absent further legislative action, the tax will be automatically reinstated for medical device sales beginning January 1, 2018. 
 Since its enactment in 2010, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In January 2017, Congress also voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. Following the passage of the Budget Resolution, in March 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation known as the American Health Care Act, which, if enacted, would amend or repeal significant portions of the ACA. Among other changes, the American Health Care Act would repeal the annual fee on certain brand prescription drugs and biologics imposed on manufacturers and importers, eliminate the 2.3% excise tax on medical devices, eliminate penalties on individuals and employers that fail to maintain or provide minimum essential coverage, and create refundable tax credits to assist individuals in buying health insurance. The American Health Care Act would also make significant changes to 
 35


Medicaid by, among other things, making Medicaid expansion optional for states, repealing the requirement that state Medicaid plans provide the same essential health benefits that are required by plans available on the exchanges, modifying federal funding, including implementing a per capita cap on federal payments to states, and changing certain eligibility requirements.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 The full impact of the ACA, its possible repeal, and any legislation passed to replace the ACE, as well as other laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may continue the downward pressure on medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 82 full-time and 3 part-time employees, of which 10 are employed in administration, 13 in manufacturing and operations, 21 in research and development, five in regulatory and quality affairs, and 36 in sales and marketing. We had three employees in Europe as of December 31, 2016, all others were in the United States. We believe that our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining is established by law in France and Germany. We and our European employees, who reside in France and Germany, have agreed to the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements. 
 Our ability to retain current talent and recruit new people into our Company is another critical factor in our performance. We have initiated multiple programs to promote our organizational culture and to identify the best possible new talent as the organization grows and new positions are made available. In 2016, we launched our five company value statements: embrace the mission, engage, build community, expect healthy tension and assume positive intent. We also adopted a cultural index tool which assesses new hire candidates for cultural fit and to encourage teamwork among existing employees.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO in May 2015, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the “JOBS Act,” and references to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
