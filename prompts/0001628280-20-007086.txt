ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Recent Developments
Restructuring Support Agreement and Chapter 11
On March 16, 2020, the Company filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, White Plains Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”) under the caption In re Internap Technology Solutions Inc. et al. The Chapter 11 Cases were filed after consultation between the Company and committee of certain holders of term loans (the “Ad Hoc Committee”) under the Company’s senior secured credit facility, regarding the restructuring of the Company’s capital structure. In connection with such consultations, the Company entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “RSA”) with holders (the “Consenting Lenders”) of approximately 77% of the Company’s outstanding term loans. As set forth in the RSA, including all exhibits, annexes and schedules attached thereto, the “Term Sheet”, the Company and Consenting Lenders agreed to the principal terms of a financial restructuring (the “Restructuring”) of the Company. The Restructuring is to be implemented through a prepackaged Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the “Plan”).
The RSA contemplates a comprehensive deleveraging of the Company’s balance sheet. Specifically, the RSA and Term Sheet provide, in pertinent part, as follows:

• | The Company entered into debtor-in-possession financing structured as a delayed draw term loan (the “DIP Facility”) as discussed below.


• | The Company’s general unsecured creditors will be paid in full in the ordinary course of business.


• | The DIP Facility will convert into a priority exit facility (the “Priority Exit Facility”) upon the Company’s emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. The Priority Exit Facility will have a 3-year maturity and bear interest at a rate of LIBOR + 1000 basis points payable in cash.


• | The Company will enter into a new term loan facility (the “New Term Loan Facility”) on the effective date of the Plan (the “Effective Date”). The New Term Loan Facility will provide for term loans in the principal amount of $225.0 million, mature 5 years after the Effective Date and bear interest at a rate of LIBOR + 650 basis points, 300 basis points of which will be paid in cash and 350 basis points will be paid in kind; provided that, at the election of the INAP board of directors post-Effective Date, 200 basis points of the LIBOR + 300 basis points cash interest may be payment in kind.


• | The lenders under the Credit Agreement dated April 6, 2017 by and among INAP, as borrower, certain of its subsidiaries as guarantors, Jefferies Finance LLC as administrative and collateral agent and the other lenders thereto (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) will receive 100% of the new common stock initially issued by reorganized INAP post-Effective Date.


• | Holders of existing INAP common stock will receive warrants to purchase 10% of the new equity of reorganized INAP (the “Warrants”); provided that such holders provide releases. The Warrants will have a strike price calculated to imply an equity

value at which the holders of claims under the Credit Agreement recover their principal amount of indebtedness under the Credit Agreement plus prepetition interest on their allowed loan claims (plus amounts outstanding under the New Term Loan Facility).
The RSA includes certain milestones for the progress of the Chapter 11 Cases, which include the dates by which the Company is required to, among other things, obtain certain court orders and consummate the Restructuring.
Financing Arrangements
New Incremental Loans
On March 13, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to borrow $5.0 million of additional incremental term loans (the “New Incremental Loans”) under the Credit Agreement. The New Incremental Loans bear interest at a rate of LIBOR (with a 1.0% floor) + 1000 basis points.
Use of Proceeds.  The Company used the proceeds of the New Incremental Loans to, among other things, (i) fund the ordinary course payments, working capital needs and other expenditures of the Company in advance of and during the Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) pay certain fees, interest, payments and expenses related to the Chapter 11 Cases, and (iii) pay fees and expenses related to the transactions contemplated by the New Incremental Loans in accordance with such budget.
Priority.  Priority for the New Incremental Loans are pari passu with the existing term loans under the Credit Agreement.
Affirmative and Negative Covenants.  The New Incremental Loans are subject to the same as those under the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Eighth Amendment (as hereinafter defined).
Events of Default.  The events of default for the New Incremental Loans are the same as those under the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Eighth Amendment.
Maturity.  The New Incremental Loans will mature on the earliest of: (i) September 11, 2020; (ii) the sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets; (iii) the date of the consummation of the Plan or (iv) certain accelerations of the obligations under the Credit Agreement.
Incremental and Eighth Amendment to Credit Agreement
In connection with the New Incremental Loans, the Company entered into the Incremental and Eighth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Eighth Amendment”) on March 13, 2020. The Eighth Amendment, among other things: (i) authorizes the incremental commitment for the New Incremental Loans under the Credit Agreement; (ii) grants additional security interests in favor of the lenders for the Company’s motor vehicles and outstanding equity interests of certain foreign subsidiaries; and (iii) adds Internap Technology Solutions Inc. as a party to the Credit Agreement.
In addition, the Eighth Amendment amended (i) the affirmative covenants to, among other things, require the Company to provide a cash receipt and disbursement budget and rolling 13-week forecasts of the same and to meet certain milestones with respect to the Chapter 11 Cases, including solicitation of the Plan, entry into the DIP Facility, and confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court; and (ii) the negative covenants to, among other things: (A) further limit the debt the Company can borrow and repay; (B) eliminate the ability of the Company to incur liens for sale and leaseback transactions, incremental debt and equity interests and real property; (C) further limit the ability of the Company to make investments; (D) eliminate the ability of the Company to engage in mergers; (E) further limit dispositions and acquisitions of certain property; (F) eliminate the ability of the Company to pay dividends or make redemptions; (G) further limit the Company’s ability to engage in transactions with affiliates and (H) eliminate the leverage and interest coverage ratio covenants.
The Eighth Amendment further amended the events of default to provide that it will be an event of default for the New Incremental Loans if, among other things, the Company uses the proceeds from the New Incremental Loans in a manner outside of the budget, subject to certain variances or in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, or the Company supports a plan of reorganization or disclosure statement that does not repay the obligations as set forth in the RSA.
Event of Default
The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement, as a result of which the principal and interest due thereunder became immediately due and payable. The ability of the lenders to enforce such payment obligations under the Credit Agreement is automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, and the lenders’ rights of enforcement in respect of obligations under the Credit Agreement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

DIP Facility
On March 19, 2020, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Super-Priority Debtor-In-Possession Credit Agreement (the “DIP Facility”) with Jefferies Finance LLC (“Jefferies”), as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto (the “DIP Lenders”). On March 19, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an interim order (the “Interim Order”) to approve the DIP Facility and the parties entered into such DIP Facility on the terms approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
The DIP Facility provides for, among other things, term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75.0 million, (including the roll up of $5.0 million of New Incremental Loans) under the Credit Agreement. All loans under the DIP Facility bear interest at a rate of either: (i) an applicable base rate plus 9% per annum or (ii) LIBOR (with a floor of 1%) plus 10% per annum.
Use of Proceeds. The Company anticipates using the proceeds of the DIP Facility to, among other things: (i) pay certain fees, interest, payments and expenses related to the Chapter 11 Cases; (ii) fund the working capital needs and expenditures of the Company during the Chapter 11 Cases; (iii) fund the Carve-Out (as defined below); and (iv) pay other related fees and expenses in accordance with budgets provided to the DIP Lenders.
Priority and Collateral. The DIP Lenders (subject to the Carve-Out as discussed below): (i) are entitled to joint and several super-priority administrative expense claim status in the Chapter 11 Cases; (ii) have a first priority lien on substantially all unencumbered assets of the Company; and (iii) have a priming first priority lien on any assets encumbered by the Credit Agreement. The Company’s obligations to the DIP Lenders and the liens and super-priority claims are subject in each case to a carve out (the “Carve-Out”) that accounts for certain administrative, court and legal fees payable in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases.
Affirmative and Negative Covenants. The DIP Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including requiring the Company to provide to the DIP Lenders a budget for the use of the Company’s funds and the achievement of certain milestones for the Chapter 11 Cases, among other covenants customary in debtor-in-possession financings.
Events of Default. The DIP Facility contains certain events of default customary in debtor-in-possession financings, including: (i) the failure to pay loans made under the DIP Facility when due; (ii) appointment of a trustee, examiner or receiver in the Chapter 11 Cases; (iii) certain violations of the Restructuring Support Agreement dated March 13, 2020, between the Company and the lenders party thereto; and (iv) the failure of the Company to use the proceeds of the loans under the DIP Facility as set forth in the budget (subject to any approved variances).
Maturity. The DIP Facility will mature on the earliest of (i) September 16, 2020; (ii) the date on which the loans under the DIP Facility become due and payable, whether by acceleration or otherwise; (iii) the effective date of the Plan; (iv) the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company; (v) the first business day on which the order approving the DIP Facility by the Bankruptcy Court expires by its terms, unless a final order has been entered and become effective prior thereto; (vi) the conversion or dismissal of the Chapter 11 Cases; (vii) dismissal of any of the Chapter 11 Cases unless consented to by the DIP Lenders or (viii) the final order approving the DIP Facility by the Bankruptcy Court is vacated, terminated, rescinded, revoked, declared null and void or otherwise ceases to be in full force and effect.
Nasdaq Delisting
On March 17, 2020, INAP received a letter (the “Nasdaq Letter”) from the staff of the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) notifying INAP that, as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, INAP’s common stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”). The Nasdaq Letter stated that the Staff’s determination was based on: (i) the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and associated public interest concerns raised by such Chapter 11 Cases; (ii) concerns regarding the residual equity interest of the existing listed securities holders; and (iii) concerns about INAP’s ability to sustain compliance with all requirements of continued listing on Nasdaq.
INAP elected not to appeal this determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel and the trading of the common stock was suspended at the opening of business on March 26, 2020, and a Form 25-NSE was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which removed the common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq. INAP’s Common Stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Market under the symbol “INAPQ.”

Going Concern and Financial Reporting
The Company has experienced negative financial trends, such as operating losses, working capital deficiencies, negative cash flows and other adverse key financial ratios. These trends, along with the resulting liquidity constraints and debt covenant compliance considerations, led to INAP’s Chapter 11 Cases, which raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern. For additional information concerning our bankruptcy proceedings under the Chapter 11 Cases, see Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Business

The IT infrastructure services market comprises a range of offerings that have emerged in response to shifting business and technology drivers. INAP competes specifically in the markets for colocation, hosting and Infrastructure-as-a-Service ("IaaS") solutions.
Multi-tenant data center providers such as INAP can meet the growing demand for off-premises infrastructure deployments through colocation, complex managed hosting, and network connectivity. Our IaaS model is designed to be flexible and scalable to keep pace with growth trends in mobility, services that require low latency and performance, and ultimately the Internet of Things ("IoT"). We aim to meet the needs of enterprises who are shifting workloads that were historically on-premise to off-premise colocation, hosted private clouds, on-ramp to public cloud environments, or some hybrid environment. We believe that the interconnection of these environments will provide customers with a range of solutions that meets their needs over a sustainable planning horizon.
Our Competitive Strengths
High Quality Data Center Facilities in Key Metropolitan Areas. We provide services in high quality facilities across 21 major metropolitan areas in nine countries. Our facilities are geographically diversified so that no one metropolitan area represents more than 15% of our total revenue. Our data center footprint is significant, with over one million gross square feet under management and approximately 600,000 square feet of sellable data center space. A significant portion of this sellable space is in our fourteen (14) ‘flagship’ data center properties, which are best-in-class facilities where we are the sole tenant, designed and constructed to specifications to support the highest criteria of security, redundancy, and performance. We are present primarily in the top MSAs in North America where we believe we touch a large addressable market of businesses and enterprises who need the products and services we offer and positions us to expand our market share and drive revenue growth.

Application-Driven Solution Engineering. The ever-evolving needs of IT environments are not one-size fits all. Applications and workloads perform optimally only when the underlying infrastructure is designed and configured to support their specific requirements. This is why we use an application-driven approach to solution engineering. We seek to understand the customer’s particular requirements, and only then do we recommend and build the best solution. Whether colocation, managed private cloud, or third party public cloud, our full-spectrum of services allow for best-fit solutions for our customers.
Full-Spectrum, High Performance Data Center, Cloud and Network Solutions. We believe our full-spectrum data center, cloud and network solutions are positioned to capture the growing demand for outsourced IT infrastructure, regardless of deployment model or service requirement. Whether an enterprise requires small or hyperscale colocation, private or public cloud, or a mix of these services in a multi-cloud or hybrid environment, we can support them, and we connect all of our locations with our Performance IP™ service. Through a combination of automation platforms and highly-skilled technical engineering, we are able to deliver best-in-class connectivity, speed, resiliency, and scalability around the world. We use technology and processes to optimize data routes, manage complex IT environments, and deliver a premium service that customers seek out for full solutions.
Diverse Customer Base. As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately 10,000 customers across various industries, including healthcare, advertising, technology, finance, technology infrastructure, gaming, and software. Our customer base is not concentrated in any particular industry; in each of the past three years, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues.
Market Opportunity

We compete in the large and growing market for IT infrastructure services (outsourced data center, compute resources, storage, network services, and managed services). Enterprises continue to migrate from on-premise IT environments to outsourced services: colocation, managed hosting, private and/or public clouds. 
Three complementary macro-level trends are driving demand for IT infrastructure services: the rapid growth of the digital economy, the increases in outsourcing of IT, and the emergence of IoT.
The Growth of the Digital Economy

The digital economy continues to impact business models with a new generation of software and networked applications. Widespread adoption of mobile devices combined with rising expectations around the performance and availability of both consumer and business applications places increasing pressure on enterprises to deliver a seamless end-user experience on any device at any time in any location. Simultaneously, Software-as-a-Service models have changed data usage patterns with information traditionally maintained on individual machines and back-office servers which are now being streamed across the Internet. These applications require predictable performance and data security.
Further, the growth of big data analytics is giving rise to a new breed of "fast data" applications that collect and analyze massive amounts of data in real time to drive immediate business decisions - for example, real-time ad bidding platforms and personalized e-commerce portals. Finally, the emergence and adoption of the IoT is giving rise to the "edge," where data center and connectivity options are required to be closer to the end user.
The Outsourcing of IT Infrastructure
On-premise IT infrastructure still accounts for the largest overall share of the market but is in rapid decline due to workloads shifting to outsourced infrastructure models, such as colocation and cloud computing. This trend favors data center and cloud service providers that can offer a range of solutions to cater to the varying needs of medium and large enterprise IT. We expect that many customers will need technical expertise provided by companies like ours to migrate, secure, and manage third party public cloud workloads, particularly as dependence on cloud solutions and computing is expected to increase.
As distributed applications become more prevalent, security concerns and compliance issues are placing new burdens on the traditional IT model and driving new costs and complexity. As a result, IT organizations are increasingly turning to infrastructure outsourcing to free-up valuable internal resources to focus on their core businesses, improve service levels and lower the overall cost of their IT operations. We serve as a partner to those resource-limited businesses and enterprises by providing the necessary infrastructure and services to address the increasing complexity of IT environments in today’s digital-centric world. We serve as a partner to businesses and enterprises, as we provide those resources to customers who are limited.

The Emergence of IoT and the ‘Edge’
The IoT continues to evolve as more and more products now have IP addresses. The volume of IoT projects being deployed has risen dramatically in recent years. This offers countless opportunities for multi-tenant data center and cloud service providers, especially ones with ‘edge’ reach, such as ours. The necessary combination of data center proximity to end-users and the ability to deliver extremely low latency for real-time application interaction, will dictate where infrastructure is deployed to enable IoT projects.
Rapid growth in data generated from IoT deployments will also continue to drive a need for low latency storage. Internet infrastructure providers with extensive data center footprints, cloud and storage options will be prime targets for IoT deployments. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this growing trend.
Our Growth Strategy
Our objective is to increase market share and deliver profitable growth as a trusted partner to our customers. We aim to offer complete solutions that utilize some or all of our full-spectrum of data center, cloud, and/or network services for businesses globally. Our strategy is driven by both organic and inorganic activities:
Improve Performance of Technical and Economic IT Outcomes for Global Organizations. By taking an application-driven approach to solution design and engineering, along with the use of our innovative automation platforms, we partner with IT managers to deploy solutions specifically aligned with their needs, reducing unnecessary complexities and costs. Regardless of deployment model (i.e., colocation, bare metal, complex managed hosting, private cloud, or managed AWS/Azure), we have the expertise and tools to support the right mix of infrastructure to optimize both technical and economic solutions. 
Increase Brand Awareness. Continued focus on our go-to-market efforts through sales and marketing are intended to give broader awareness to our full-spectrum of data center, cloud and network solutions. Investments in marketing initiatives, sales training, and overall brand coverage are designed to give greater attention and coverage to us and support the efforts of our quota bearing sales representatives with both prospective and existing customers.
Expand IT Wallet Share with our Existing Customer Base. With our growing portfolio of data center and cloud services, and a customer base of approximately 10,000, we have the opportunity to support our customers’ expansion needs with production, test, development, and disaster recovery offerings in addition to 24/7 managed services. Customers desire a single trusted partner that can offer them solutions for their needs today, as well as their projected needs of the future. Our "land and expand" approach to customer lifecycle management enables us to remain tied closely to the customer’s IT and business roadmap and anticipate their evolving needs. We are staffed with account management and customer success organizations that align with our strategy to grow in these efforts.
Increase Scale and Capabilities. After our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect to continue to look for strategic acquisitions, joint ventures or partnership opportunities that would add to or strengthen our service portfolio, expand our geographic reach or increase the scale of our business. 
Our Products and Services
Colocation
Colocation involves providing conditioned power with back-up capacity and physical space within data centers along with associated services such as interconnection, remote hands, environmental controls, monitoring and security while allowing our customers to deploy and manage their servers, storage and other equipment in our secure data centers.

On March 26, 2020, our common stock was delisted from Nasdaq and now is quoted on the OTC Market under the symbol “INAPQ.” Our principal executive offices are located at 12120 Sunset Hills Road, Suite 330, Reston, Virginia 20190.
Competition

The market for Internet infrastructure services is intensely competitive, remains highly fragmented and is characterized by rapid innovation, price sensitivity and consolidation. We believe that the principal factors of competition for service providers in our target markets include breadth of product offering, product features and performance, level of customer service and technical support, price, brand recognition and strength of company financial position. We believe that we can compete on the basis of these factors to varying degrees, but many of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are and have additional flexibility, particularly while we are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Our current and potential competition primarily consists of colocation providers, managed service and hosting providers, public and private cloud providers and network service providers.
Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our IT infrastructure services and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2019, we had 18 patents (15 issued in the United States and 3 issued internationally) that extend to various dates between 2020 and 2033, and 20 registered trademarks in the United States. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, trademarks and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in our industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, trademark and trade secret laws. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us.
 8

Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 540 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We generally believe our labor relations to be good.
