Overview
Rapid7 is advancing security with visibility, analytics, and automation delivered through our Insight Platform. Our solutions simplify the complex, allowing security teams to work more effectively with IT and development to reduce vulnerabilities, monitor for misconfigurations and malicious behavior, investigate and shut down attacks, and automate routine tasks.
In the 20 years that Rapid7 has been in business, security companies and trends have come and gone, while broader technology innovation continues to advance rapidly. Every company is now a technology company, and rampant innovation inevitably creates security risk. The migration of businesses to the cloud, more distributed workforces and ubiquitous connected devices present security teams with an increasingly complex, ever-changing, and unpredictable attack surface. 
We believe as cybersecurity challenges continue to rise exponentially, two key factors can prevent organizations from effectively managing their growing security exposure. First, the tools to manage complex security problems are often equally complicated to use. Second, there is a scarcity of cybersecurity professionals who are qualified to successfully manage these sophisticated tools. These two factors compound the difficulties that resource-constrained organizations face when attempting to minimize their security exposure, meet security compliance regulations and provide visibility to their leadership. We call the expanding divide between risk created through innovation and risk effectively managed by security teams the Security Achievement Gap.
We believe Rapid7 is uniquely positioned to improve how customer security challenges are addressed. All of our solutions and services are built with and supported by the expertise of our dedicated team of security researchers and consultants, who bring knowledge of attacker behavior and emerging vulnerabilities directly to customers. We also continue to invest in further simplifying our technology to improve usability, lowering the barrier for teams and organizations who lack resources to manage their security posture.
While our security technology is the foundation of our mission to make successful security accessible to all, technology alone will not solve today’s cybersecurity challenges. Our ongoing commitment to researching and partnering with the technology community helps to curb new security risks born through innovation. We are also investing in under-served, at risk communities, like non-profits and hospitals, to better understand their needs and make security technology and services accessible. By continuously improving our technology, stemming the creation of risk in the community, and making security more usable and accessible, Rapid7 aims to close the Security Achievement Gap.
As of December 31, 2020, we had more than 9,700 customers that rely on Rapid7 technology, services, and research to improve security outcomes and securely advance their organizations. We have experienced strong revenue growth with revenue increasing from $157.4 million in 2016 to $411.5 million in 2020, representing a 27% compound annual growth rate. 
In 2020, 2019 and 2018 recurring revenue, defined as revenue from term software licenses, content subscriptions, managed services, cloud-based subscriptions and maintenance and support, was 90%, 87% and 81%, respectively, of total revenue. We incurred net losses of $98.8 million, $53.8 million and $55.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as we continued to invest for long-term growth.

Insight Platform
Our cloud-native Insight Platform is at the core of our product offerings. The platform was built using our extensive experience in collecting and analyzing data to enable our customers to create and manage analytics-driven cyber security risk management programs. By utilizing our powerful, proprietary analytics to assess and understand the context and relationships around users, IT assets and cyber threats within a customer’s environment, our solutions make it easier for teams to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, monitor for misconfigurations and malicious behavior, investigate and shutdown attacks, and automate operations. 
Our Insight Platform provides a high level of scalability. We leverage cloud technologies to achieve a scalable delivery model with a high degree of redundancy, fault tolerance, and cost-effectiveness. 
We also designed our Insight Platform to provide a secure environment for our customers' data. We deploy a variety of technologies and practices that are designed to help ensure that the data collected from a customer’s environment remains proprietary, secure and operational.
Insight Platform's Features:
Visibility: The Insight Platform allows security professionals to collect data once across their IT environment, enabling Security, IT, and development operations (DevOps) teams to collaborate effectively as they analyze shared data. 
•Unified Data Collection: We designed the Insight Platform to allow customers to collect their data once and leverage that same data across multiple solutions, providing shared visibility across teams and reducing time to value for additional solutions. Our robust data collection architecture supports gathering a wide swath of operational data from endpoints to the cloud, including key data about assets and user-specific behavior, into a unified, searchable dataset. 
•Agentless and Agent-Based Architecture: We developed our platform with flexible processing technologies that employ both agentless data collection and our own internally-developed endpoint agent technology, which enables rapid and seamless integration of our products into our customers’ modern IT environments and provides security and IT professionals with instant visibility into their dynamic and rapidly-expanding IT ecosystem. Our lightweight endpoint Insight Agent is designed to automatically collect data from all endpoints, even those from remote workers and sensitive assets that cannot be actively scanned, or that rarely join the corporate network.
•Endpoint Detection and Visibility: With a universal lightweight agent and endpoint scanning, the Insight Platform provides real-time detection and the ability to proactively remediate IT environments, before a potential attack happens.
•Network Traffic Analysis: Network flow data illuminates environments and helps accelerate investigations. Our lightweight Network Sensor passively analyzes raw traffic to increase visibility into user activity, pinpoint real threats, and accelerate investigation with granular detail of attacker movement.
•Cloud and Virtual Infrastructure Assessment: Modern networks and infrastructures are constantly changing. The Insight Platform integrates with cloud services and virtual infrastructure to help ensure that technology is configured securely and that security professionals know when new devices are brought online. 
•Attack Surface Monitoring with Project Sonar: As organizations grow and infrastructure becomes more complex, maintaining visibility into attack surface becomes more challenging. Our platform directly integrates with Project 
Sonar, a Rapid7 research project that regularly scans the public internet, to gain insights into global exposure to common vulnerabilities. This capability also enables security professionals to identify previously unknown, externally facing assets connected to the internet.
Analytics: Increasing IT environment complexity coupled with a severe lack of cyber security professionals is overwhelming security and IT teams, who are struggling to deal with false positives and maintain adequate levels of cyber security. Our Insight Platform addresses these challenges with the following features:
•User and Attacker Behavior Analytics: Our Insight Platform incorporates extensive user behavior analytics (UBA) and attacker behavior analytics (ABA) to provide rapid context around users, attackers and assets involved in an incident, enabling organizations to more quickly respond to, contain and mitigate breaches. Our platform incorporates comprehensive UBA to create a behavior profile for each user and correlates every event with a user, asset or application to detect compromised credentials, lateral movement and other malicious behavior. 
•Risk Prioritization and Management: With built-in risk assessment and risk prioritization, IT-integrated remediation projects, and pre-built automation workflows, the Insight Platform provides a granular view of what is relevant and critical today, to help ensure risks can be prioritized and mitigated more effectively. 
•Threat Detection: Our Insight Platform includes integrated threat feeds, informed by public data as well as proprietary threat intelligence and adversary research, and continuously gathers and combines them with a customer’s IT environment, to show threats that are most relevant to them.
•Centralized Log Management: Our cloud-based platform correlates millions of daily events in any IT environment directly to the users and assets behind them to highlight risk across the environment and help prioritize where to search and automate compliance without the requirement of extensive hardware.
•Deception Technology: Monitoring solutions that only analyze log files leave traces of the attacker unfound. Through our deep understanding of attacker behavior, our Insight Platform provides not only UBA and endpoint detection, but also easy-to-deploy intruder traps. These include honeypots, honey users, honey credentials, and honey files, all crafted to identify malicious behavior earlier in the attack chain.
•Industry Experts: With a highly specialized team of penetration testing, incident response, threat hunting and security operation center experts, we believe we are uniquely positioned to stay ahead of emerging threats and help detect threats quickly across a customer’s entire IT ecosystem. 
Automation: Our Insight Platform unites technology stacks and allows security operations teams to connect disparate solutions within their cyber security, IT and development operations. 
•Built-in Workflows: Security tools have not historically been built to work well together, and without deep programming knowledge, building automation between tools was nearly impossible. With our Insight Platform, security professionals can streamline their operations with connect-and-go workflows, without requiring any code, resulting in significant time and cost savings. Examples of these workflows include assisted patching and automated containment.
•Highly Customizable: The Insight Platform not only has a wide range of pre-built workflows and integrations, it is also highly extensible. With approximately 300 plugins to connect security tools and easily customizable connect-and-go workflows, the Insight Platform frees up security teams to tackle other challenges, while still leveraging human decision points when it is most critical.
Insight Platform Product Offerings
We offer our Insight Platform solutions as software-as-a-service products, on a subscription basis.

Embedded workflows also allow Security and IT teams to automatically deploy compensating controls for vulnerabilities that cannot be patched.
InsightVM is offered through a cloud-based subscription or as a managed service. The managed service is known as Managed Vulnerability Risk Management, which provides our resource constrained customers with a fully outsourced option for leveraging our innovation, expertise and technology.
InsightIDR: InsightIDR, our Incident Detection and Response (IDR) solution, is designed to enable organizations to rapidly detect and respond to cyber security incidents and breaches across physical, virtual and cloud assets. 
InsightIDR unifies SIEM, UBA, and endpoint detection to detect stealthy attacks across today’s complex networks. It analyzes the billions of events that occur daily in organizations to reduce them to the important behaviors and deliver high-fidelity and prioritized alerts. In addition to identifying stealthy attacks often missed by other solutions, InsightIDR focuses the security team on issues that warrant investigation and reduces the time to investigate with its user correlation, powerful search and endpoint interrogation capabilities.
InsightIDR is designed to provide a cost-effective response to the need for SIEM. With our Metasploit community, research and incident response services, we are continually studying and identifying the latest attacker methods. We have found ways to increase accuracy, speed processes, and achieve greater confidence, even as attacker methods change. These include built-in deception capabilities such as honeypots and automated threat intelligence feeds that quickly alert our customers to new attacker behaviors seen in the wild by our own threat hunters.
Unlike most SIEMs, InsightIDR also provides the capability to seamlessly act on many threats automatically, thus further reducing the time from detection to response. InsightIDR includes out-of-the-box automation workflows to improve analyst productivity such as automated containment to mitigate an attack. Additionally, with the Insight Agent, users can kill malicious processes or quarantine infected endpoints from the network. They can also use InsightIDR to take containment actions across Active Directory, Access Management, EDR, and firewall tools.
InsightIDR also offers modules for Enhanced Network Traffic Analysis and Enhanced Endpoint Telemetry. Enhanced Network Traffic Analysis continuously monitors network traffic at any location or site across your network. This data increases visibility across the attack surface and detects intrusions (or other potential security events) on the network. Enhanced Endpoint Telemetry is the collection of detailed activity logs that are sent to InsightIDR each time a process starts on a monitored endpoint. In short, these logs give visibility into all endpoint activity—whether events occurred before, during, or after a detection. With this holistic view into endpoint activity, customers can unlock custom use cases and enrich investigations in InsightIDR.
InsightIDR is offered through a cloud-based subscription or as a managed service. The managed service is known as Managed Detection and Response, a fully outsourced service that combines our team of expert analysts with InsightIDR. When attacks are found, customers are promptly informed of all known details and our team moves to incident response, providing security teams with detailed, easy-to-follow remediation steps tailored to the environment.
InsightAppSec: InsightAppSec provides comprehensive dynamic application security testing that continuously analyzes web applications for security vulnerabilities.
The key features include: a universal translator to enable IT security professionals to analyze complex applications; customized attack simulation capabilities that allow automatic testing of workflows such as shopping carts; scanning automation; attack replay, which allows replay of vulnerabilities in real time in order to verify that vulnerabilities are exploitable and that successful remediation has occurred; continuous site monitoring, which detects changes in application ecosystems and triggers a re-scan according to configurable settings; and integration with ticketing systems.
InsightAppSec enables integration with protection technologies to automatically generate web application firewalls (WAFs), which are custom rules that help to protect vulnerable applications while the vulnerabilities are being remediated. InsightAppSec supports most leading WAFs, including F5, Sourcefire and Imperva.

We perform security research that enables the analytics in our platform and products as well as delivers strategic value to the security community at large. The output of our research results in threat intelligence, exposure analysis and attacker awareness that we publish as well as integrate into our platform. This data is used for security research, product development, and across our services to help protect and inform our customers, partners and community. We share this data with validated educational 
and private security researchers, research partners, vetted threat sharing communities, and organizational security teams through our Open Data portal to foster collaboration and encourage discovery of new insights. We collect data for research purposes through two key areas:
    Attacker Intelligence: We collect data from across the internet through a variety of honeypots distributed both geographically and across IP space. The honeypots collect many data types which are then analyzed to help enhance our understanding of attacker methods.
    Internet Intelligence: We conduct internet-wide scans across many services and protocols to gain insight into global exposures and vulnerabilities.
This data collected is analyzed for the purpose of analytics in our platform and results in core research reports. We publish a variety of reports including The National Exposure Index, The Industry Cyber Exposure Report and Under the Hoodie. The National Exposure Index, published annually, is a census report that highlights the state of exposed internet services at the nation-state level and provides key trending information on the use of insecure protocols. The Industry Cyber Exposure Index details the attack surface, insecure service presence, email safety configurations, malware infection rates and internet supply-chain risks of Fortune 500 companies. The Under the Hoodie report sheds light on the art of penetration testing by revealing not just the process, techniques and tools that go into it, but also revealing the real-world experience of our engineers and investigators, gathered over thousands of penetration tests.

To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and other contractual protections to protect our intellectual property in the United States and other jurisdictions. 
We have numerous issued patents and a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and have a number of patent applications pending. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our solutions are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. 
We also license software from third parties for integration into our offerings, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.
Human Capital
Rapid7 is dedicated to making the best in security operations achievable for all, and our employees are critical to achieving this mission. In order to continue to innovate, compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain experienced employees. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do their best work, and give employees the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social impact.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,847 full-time employees, including 341 in product and service delivery and support, 742 in sales and marketing, 517 in research and development and 247 in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,316 full-time employees in the United States and 531 full-time employees internationally. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders and fit within our company culture. In addition to their base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company’s goals with short-term incentives and long-term equity awards tied to the value of our stock price. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests, including by incentivizing business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivating based on long-term company performance and integrating compensation with our business plans. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employees a wide array of benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off and retirement benefits. We also provide emotional well-being services through our Employee Assistance Program.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that a company culture focused on diversity and inclusion is a key driver of creativity and innovation and that diverse and inclusive teams make better business decisions, which ultimately drive better business outcomes. We are committed 
to recruiting, retaining and developing high-performing, innovative and engaged employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences. In 2018, we launched a diversity initiative to increase the number of under-represented groups (women and people of color) to fifty percent of the employee base in the United States by the end of 2020. We undertook to promote transparency by publishing our workforce demographic data internally and to increase thoughtful discussions across the Company, including holding unconscious bias training for our employees, further expanding efforts to recruit under-represented groups through referrals and by expanding beyond the traditional networks from which we recruited. We are also focused on identifying and promoting diverse leaders through the organization at all levels and signed the Corporate Parity Pledge, which includes, among other things, a commitment to interview at least one woman and one person of color for every open role at the vice president level and above. We have also directed our talent acquisition team to take the further step of interviewing at least one woman and/or person of color for every role we hire for. These efforts yielded results. At the end of 2020, we increased the percent of under-represented employees in the U.S. to over 49%, with over 4% increases in each of the percent of women and the percent of people of color. Additionally, in 2020, we completed a comprehensive employee pay equity survey for our U.S. employees, with outside advisors using regression models to determine that women and people of color at Rapid7 were not paid less for the same job, level, and location, controlling for pay differentiators such as performance and tenure/experience. We intend to conduct an analysis like this every few years. 
Community Involvement
We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work, and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We partner with a variety of STEM and inclusion-focused programs to promote technology education for all. Beyond contributions of cash, we encourage employee volunteerism at all our locations by both designating a global day of service each fall, as well as more concentrated work throughout the year.
