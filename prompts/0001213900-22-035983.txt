 Item 1. Business.



Overview



We are a blank check company incorporated on December 4, 2017, as a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of effecting a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). Our sponsor is Tech and Energy Transition Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability company directly controlled by MIHI LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Group Limited (Macquarie Group Limited and together with its subsidiaries and funds (or similar vehicles) managed by such subsidiaries) and a part of Macquarie Capital (Macquarie Capital is a division of Macquarie, which includes Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.).



Although we are not limited to a particular industry or sector for the purpose of consummating a Business Combination, we intend to focus our search on companies in end markets – communications, internetworking, clean energy, digital technology and services and software applications that enable or support digital transformation.



Our registration statement for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on March 16, 2021. On March 19, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 38,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units offered, the “Public Shares”) at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $385.0 million and incurring offering costs of approximately $22.2 million, including approximately $7,700,000 of underwriting commission, $13,475,000 of deferred underwriting commission and $1,066,089 of other offering costs.



Substantially concurrently with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 7,366,667 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately $11.05 million.



Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $385.0 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and invested in United States government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an initial Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.



Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating our initial Business Combination. Our initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in Trust) at the time we sign a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination. However, we will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

Our entire activity from inception through March 31, 2022 related to our formation and the preparation for the Initial Public Offering, and, since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. We have not engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we complete a Business Combination, and we have not generated any operating revenue to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



We will provide the holders of our Public Shares (the “Public Stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account.



If we are unable to complete a Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Combination Period”), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding-up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, our remaining stockholders and our board of directors (the “Board), dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.



Effecting a Business Combination



Our Business Strategy



Combining our management team’s domain, operating and market sector expertise, Macquarie Capital’s sourcing strategies and the Macquarie Capital platform, we believe will generate attractive returns for stockholders by selecting a high-quality target, negotiating favorable acquisition terms at an attractive valuation and creating the foundation for improved operational performance of the acquired company. In particular, we expect to distinguish ourselves with our ability to:

● | Leverage Best-in-class Sourcing Capabilities of the Macquarie Capital Platform. We believe our ability to access the best-in-class sourcing capabilities of the Macquarie Capital platform is a significant advantage. The multiple sourcing vectors available to us through Macquarie Capital include a network of executives, founders, sponsors, academics and consultants that we can use to identify and evaluate suitable target businesses that could benefit from our experience in structuring complex transactions, accessing capital for growth, deleveraging and operational and strategic expertise.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Bring Unique Rigor to the Process of Identifying and Structuring a Business Combination. Macquarie Capital has the investment capabilities and capital markets expertise necessary to consummate a successful Business Combination. The team’s demonstrated ability to identify, value and close large, complex transactions is a distinct advantage that is further bolstered by Macquarie Capital’s reputation, global footprint and significant investing capabilities.

● | Create a platform opportunity. We believe we have the skills necessary to identify a company and give it a foundation for success. As part of our growth strategy, we may contemplate organic as well as potential inorganic growth opportunities that fit our strategy.

Business Combination Criteria



Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria or guidelines. We intend to focus on companies that provide value-added services and also:

● | Have a Leading Position in Attractive Industries. We will seek to acquire a target company or business that holds a leading position in an industry with large addressable markets, strong secular growth and a favorable regulatory environment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have Demonstrated Organic Growth. We will seek to acquire a business that has a track record of organic growth, particularly from the sale of recurring products and services into large and growing markets. Emphasis will be placed on companies that demonstrate the ability to up-sell and cross-sell to existing customers, maintain low overall churn rates and continue to innovate with new products and services through changing market conditions. Customer and product diversification along with strong overall industry growth will also be important factors in our selection process.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have Strong Unit Economics. We will seek to acquire a business that has demonstrated strong unit economics in its core products and markets. We will also look for a business capable of maintaining strong cash flow generation in the long term.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have Opportunities for Inorganic Growth. We will seek to acquire a business that can serve as a consolidator for future acquisitions, and we will use the skills of our management team, Board and advisory board members to support such inorganic growth efforts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are Differentiated. We will seek to acquire a business with a sustaining competitive differentiation. Sources of differentiation can include but are not limited to: patents, product development, brands, customer reputation or other Intellectual Property (IP), unique technical expertise and or personnel, innovative processes or proprietary sourcing and distribution/customer access.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have a Committed and Exceptional Management Team. We will seek to acquire a business with a professional management team whose members have distinguished themselves in terms of expertise, experience, performance, leadership and commitment. In addition to having a strong operating track record, we will look for team who demonstrate a high level of personal integrity. Where necessary, we will enhance the capabilities of the management team of the target business by recruiting additional talent through Macquarie Capital’s network of contacts
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We intend to seek a target with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $750 million to $4.0 billion, determined according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies. We believe targeting companies of this size will provide a substantial number of opportunities for investment and will maximize the value of the collective network of our management team and Macquarie Capital.



These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive or required. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that fact in our stockholder communications related to our initial Business Combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Additional Disclosures



Our Acquisition Process



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. All potential transactions considered by the Company will be reviewed and approved by an investment committee (the “Investment Committee”) prior to submission to the Board. The Investment Committee currently consists of Mr. Handen, Mr. Roseman and Mr. Hesse. The consent of each member of the Investment Committee will be required for a potential transaction to be submitted for consideration by the Board.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with Macquarie, our Sponsor, officers or directors, nor are we prohibited from doing so with a business that is or is affiliated with any Macquarie Account. In the event we seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with Macquarie, our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), or from an independent accounting firm, that such initial Business Combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view.



Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our securities, and accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Business Combination.



Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors become aware of a Business Combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors or Macquarie, or policies applicable to Macquarie, will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial Business Combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.



While Macquarie will not have any duty to offer acquisition opportunities to us, Macquarie may become aware of a potential transaction that may be an attractive opportunity for us, which it may or may not decide to share with us.



Macquarie is a worldwide, full-service investment banking, broker-dealer, asset management and financial services organization and a major participant in global financial markets. As such, Macquarie provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high net-worth individuals. Macquarie acts as an investment banker, research provider, investment adviser, financier, adviser, market maker, prime broker, derivatives dealer, lender, counterparty, agent, principal and investor. In those and other capacities, Macquarie advises clients in all major markets and purchases, sells, holds and recommends a broad array of investments, including securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps, indices, baskets and other financial instruments and products for its own account and for the accounts of clients, through client accounts and the relationships and products it sponsors, manages and advises. Macquarie has direct and indirect interests in the global fixed income, currency, commodity, equities, bank loan and other markets, and the securities and issuers, in which we and Macquarie Accounts may directly and indirectly invest.

Additionally, we may, but are not required to, engage Macquarie for services as a financial advisor in connection with identifying and investigating potential targets for our Business Combination. Conflicts may arise from Macquarie’s sponsorship of the Company, its provision of services both to us (including as a financial advisor) and to third-party clients, as well as from actions undertaken by Macquarie for its own account. In performing services for other clients and also when acting for its own account, Macquarie may take commercial steps which may have an adverse effect on us. Any of Macquarie’s financial market activities may, individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on us, and the interests of Macquarie or its clients or counterparties may at times be adverse to ours.



Initial Business Combination



The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) rules require that our initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions). We refer to this as the 80% of fair market value test. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our Board based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our Board will rely on generally accepted standards, our Board will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the Board in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide Public Stockholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our Board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial Business Combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.



We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination so that the post-Business Combination company in which our Public Stockholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination such that the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-Business Combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial Business Combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-Business Combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If our initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

Competition



We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, including, without limitation, Macquarie and other Macquarie Accounts, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for Business Combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing Business Combinations. While we believe there will be numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. Our Sponsor or any of its affiliates (including Macquarie) may make additional investments in us, although our Sponsor and its affiliates have no obligation or other duty to do so. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our Public Stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing an initial Business Combination.
Human Capital



We currently have four officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to the Company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the current stage of the Business Combination process.
