PART I
Item 1. Business
World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. is an integrated media and entertainment company. "WWE" refers to World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. References to "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to WWE. The initials "WWE" and our stylized and iconic "W" logo are two of our trademarks. This report also contains other WWE trademarks and trade names as well as those of other companies. All trademarks and trade names appearing in this report are the property of their respective holders.
We have been involved in the sports entertainment business for four decades, and have developed WWE into one of the most popular brands in global entertainment today. We are principally engaged in the production and distribution of unique and creative content through various channels, including the premium over-the-top network (“WWE Network”) monetized through license arrangements or through direct-to-consumer subscriptions, content rights agreements, premium live event programming, filmed entertainment, live events, licensing of various WWE themed products, and the sale of consumer products featuring our brands. At the heart of our success are the athletic and entertainment skills and appeal of our Superstars, and our consistently innovative and multi-faceted storylines. Our distribution platforms provide significant cross-promotion and marketing opportunities that reinforce our brands while effectively reaching our fans.
Based on the strength of the Company’s brands and its ownership and control over its intellectual property, the Company has been able to leverage its content and talent globally across virtually all media platforms. We continually evaluate additional opportunities to monetize new and existing content. 
Our operations are organized around the following principal activities:
Media:
The Media segment reflects the production and monetization of long-form and short-form video content across various platforms, including WWE Network, broadcast and pay television, digital and social media, as well as filmed entertainment. Across these platforms, revenues principally consist of content rights fees, subscriptions to WWE Network, and advertising and sponsorships. Effective March 18, 2021, the domestic monetization of WWE Network is generated from content license fees and certain shared sponsorship revenues from NBC Universal (“NBCU”). Media segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 include the upfront revenue recognition related to the delivery of certain intellectual property rights under this agreement.
Live Events:
Live events provide ongoing content for our media platforms. Live Event segment revenues consist primarily of ticket sales, revenues from events for which we receive a fixed fee, as well as the sale of travel packages associated with the Company’s global live events. As a result of the global spread of the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”), these revenues had been greatly limited from March 2020 through the first half of 2021. We held our annual WrestleMania events on April 10 and 11, 2021 with ticketed audiences, and on July 16, 2021, we resumed our domestic and international live event touring schedules.
Consumer Products:
The Consumer Products segment engages in the merchandising of WWE branded products, such as video games, toys and apparel, through licensing arrangements and direct-to-consumer sales. Revenues principally consist of royalties and licensee fees related to WWE branded products, and sales of merchandise distributed at our live events and through eCommerce platforms.
Media
Media net revenues were $936.2 million, $868.2 million and $743.1 million, representing 85%, 89% and 77% of total net revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Network
WWE Network launched in February 2014, becoming the first-ever 24/7 live streaming direct-to-consumer network. In connection with our multi-year agreement with Peacock TV LLC (“Peacock”), an affiliate of NBCU, beginning on March 18, 2021, the Peacock paid streaming service is the exclusive home to WWE Network in the United States. The content licensed via Peacock includes WWE’s premium live event content, second runs of our in-ring television programming, original and archival content, as well as new WWE Network content. Our subscription-based WWE Network is still available in most international markets other than embargoed 

 

countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, among others. Subscribers can access all of WWE’s premium live events, exclusive original programming and our video-on-demand library.
In addition to our premium live events, WWE Network content also includes exclusive original programming, groundbreaking documentaries, reality shows and in-ring specials, including WWE Ruthless Aggression, Steve Austin’s Broken Skull Sessions and WWE’s The Bump. Our strategy of creating compelling original content for broadcast on WWE Network has contributed to the popularity of WWE Network, which premiered nearly 380 hours of original content during 2021. 
Core Content Rights Fees
Leveraging our expertise in live event television production, we currently produce seven hours of original weekly domestic television programming, RAW, SmackDown and NXT, our core content. RAW and NXT are licensed domestically under multi-year contracts with NBCU, while SmackDown is licensed domestically under a multi-year contract with Fox Network. We also distribute second runs of RAW and NXT to Hulu, which are available after the original first run airing dates on television, along with a wide selection of other WWE content.
RAW is a three-hour live primetime program airing on Mondays, which ranks among the most watched regularly scheduled programs on primetime cable television. RAW remains the longest running weekly episodic program in primetime television history, with over 1,450 original episodes, and anchors USA Network’s programming line-up, consistently helping make it the top-rated cable entertainment network.
SmackDown is a two-hour live primetime program airing on Fridays on Fox Network. SmackDown continues to be the second longest running weekly episodic program in primetime TV history, second only to RAW. 
NXT is a two-hour live primetime program airing on Tuesday nights on USA Network. The weekly program continues to air on WWE Network shortly after the initial run on USA Network.
WWE’s TV-PG, family-friendly television programming, including RAW and SmackDown, can be seen in more than one billion homes and in 30 languages around the world. Our international broadcast partners currently include: BT Sport in the United Kingdom; Sony Ten in India and Rogers in Canada, among many others. 
Advertising and Sponsorships
WWE utilizes a multitude of platforms, including the Internet and social media, to promote our brands, market and distribute our content and digital products, create a community experience among our fans and sell advertising across these various platforms. WWE currently streams its media content on select social media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook. WWE surpassed 85 million subscribers on YouTube, and consistently ranks among the top viewed channels, with nearly 15 billion views of WWE content in 2021. The Company also receives advertising revenues from YouTube and Facebook based on viewership data of our content. In 2021, WWE had over 1.2 billion social media fan engagements across social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Tumblr.
Our primary website, WWE.com, attracted an average of over four million monthly unique visitors worldwide during 2021. These visitors viewed an average of 44 million pages and four million video streams per month. WWE short-form video and other content is available through our mobile partnerships. WWE currently has local language-based websites allowing fans to experience WWE in their native language with a concentration on local events and shows. Currently, the available languages are English, Spanish, Mandarin, French, German, Polish and Arabic. We monetize our digital advertising inventory on WWE.com in global markets via programmatic ad sales and relationships with sales agencies.
In addition, through our product integrations, we offer advertisers a full range of our promotional opportunities, including online and print advertising, on-air announcements and special appearances by our Superstars. These opportunities allow our advertisers and sponsors to engage consumers across a variety of our platforms. In 2021, we grew several partnerships with blue-chip brands, including Cricket, Credit One, Procter & Gamble, Applebee’s, Constellation Brands and Papa John’s Pizza. We also partnered with new advertisers, such as Netflix, Blue Triton, General Motors, Pizza Hut and Wendy’s. Our sponsors promote their products utilizing our digital media assets, including promotion on WWE.com as well as promotion through WWE Network and through our live events. Certain sponsorship sales related to WWE Network are shared with NBCU.
Other
Our Media segment also generates revenue from the distribution of other WWE content, including, but not limited to, certain live in-ring programming content in international markets, scripted, reality and other programming.

 


Our current reality-based television series is Miz and Mrs. This docuseries, which premiered in July 2018 on USA Network, chronicles the lives of WWE Superstars The Miz and Maryse. Following the success of the first two seasons in this series, USA Network has renewed the hit unscripted series for a third season, which is expected to air during 2022.
Our WWE Media team also develops and produces feature films, television (scripted, non-scripted), and digital content. In 2021, we secured partnerships for films, animated content, unscripted formats, scripted series and documentaries on a variety of platforms, including Netflix, A&E, Universal Television and other domestic and international platforms. Our partnership with A&E continued to expand with the creation of multiple documentaries, including WWE Legends and WWE’s Most Wanted Treasures, driving viewership gains on Sunday nights for the A&E network. We also entered the premium scripted space by announcing a partnership with Blumhouse for an original series, The United States of America Vs. Vince McMahon, which will be a fictionalized version of the 1994 trial.
Live Events
Live Events net revenues were $57.8 million, $19.9 million and $125.6 million, representing 5%, 2% and 13% of total net revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our broad and talented roster of Superstars allows us to perform in numerous domestic markets and take advantage of the strong international demand for our events. Live events and the associated programming produced at our live events are our principal creative content and production activities. Our creative team develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our premium live events which air on WWE Network and are also available via pay-per-view.
The global spread of COVID-19 and the various attempts to contain it have resulted in restrictions, postponements and cancellations of various events, and the cancellation of ticketed events due to public health concerns. The impact of COVID-19 was significant on our live events segment from March 2020 through the first half of 2021, as revenues are highly dependent on ticket sales at our live events. We held our annual WrestleMania events on April 10 and 11, 2021 with ticketed audiences, and on July 16, 2021, we resumed our domestic and international live event touring schedules.
North American Ticket Sales
In 2021, following our return to live event touring after nearly a year and a half, we produced 88 live events (excluding NXT) throughout North America, entertaining over 605,000 fans at an average ticket price of $76.05. We held many of these live events at major stadiums and arenas across the country. In addition to providing content for our television and other programming, these events provide us with a real-time assessment of the popularity of our storylines and characters.
International Ticket Sales
In 2021, following our return to live event touring, we produced 13 live events (excluding NXT) internationally, reaching nearly 60,000 fans at an average ticket price of $78.37. These events were held primarily in the United Kingdom during our international tour in September 2021. We also held one large-scale international event in 2021, for which we received a fixed fee.
Consumer Products
Consumer Products net revenues were $101.2 million, $86.1 million and $91.7 million, representing 9%, 9% and 10% of total net revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Consumer Product Licensing
We have established a worldwide licensing program using our marks and logos, copyrighted works and characters on a large variety of products, including video games, toys, apparel and books. Currently, we have relationships with more than 100 licensees worldwide that provide products for sale at major retailers. To maintain the distinctive style and quality of our intellectual property and brand, we retain creative approval over the design, packaging, advertising and promotional materials associated with these products. Additionally, we continually seek new opportunities to partner with best-in-class organizations to develop new products for our fans and further expand our licensing business. In this regard, during 2021, we announced an exclusive multi-year agreement with Blockchain Creative Labs to launch a non-fungible token (“NFT”) marketplace for licensed digital WWE tokens and collectibles. During 2021, we also announced a multi-year agreement with the Panini Group that will make Panini WWE’s exclusive trading card and collectible sticker partner. Both licensing agreements will begin in the first quarter of 2022.
Video games and toys are among the largest components of our licensing program. We have a comprehensive, multi-year licensing agreement with Mattel, Inc., our master toy licensee, covering all global territories, and a multi-year licensing agreement with Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. ("Take-Two") to produce and sell our branded console video games. WWE branded video games currently include WWE 2K and WWE Battlegrounds, available on PlayStation and XBOX platforms and on iOS and Android devices, and WWE 

 

SuperCard, available on iOS and Android devices. We recently announced Rey Mysterio as the main cover star of our franchise game, WWE 2K22, which will be released on March 11, 2022. The video game industry continues to migrate the availability of video games toward downloadable content through an Internet connected device. Accordingly, our video games can be downloaded via the Internet and contain subsequent downloadable content that can be purchased to add additional characters and game modes to enhance game play.
Music is an integral part of the WWE entertainment experience. We compose and record music, including Superstar entrance themes, in our recording studio. In addition to our own composed music, we license music performed by popular artists.
eCommerce
WWEShop is our direct-to-consumer e-commerce storefront. WWE merchandise is also distributed on other domestic and international e-commerce platforms, including Amazon. We processed 586,600 orders during 2021 as compared to 722,300 in 2020, with the higher volume in 2020 driven, in part, by changes in consumer spending habits as a result of COVID-19.
Venue Merchandise
Our direct-to-consumer venue merchandise business consists of the design, sourcing, marketing and distribution of numerous WWE-branded products such as t-shirts, belts, caps and other novelty items, all of which feature our Superstars and/or logos.
The impact of COVID-19 was significant on our venue merchandise results from March 2020 through the first half of 2021, as revenues are highly dependent on purchases of merchandise by consumers at our live events. Following our annual WrestleMania events on April 10 and 11, 2021, which were held with ticketed audiences, we resumed our domestic and international live event touring schedules on July 16, 2021.
Customers
Our customers include content distributors of our media content through their networks and platforms, fans who purchase tickets to our live events or purchase our merchandise at venues or online through our eCommerce platforms, subscribers to WWE Network, advertisers, sponsors, consumer product licensees, and film distributors/buyers. As noted elsewhere, we have several important partners, including NBCU and its affiliates who, among other things, carry the domestic television distribution of Raw and NXT, and, beginning in March 2021, carry the exclusive domestic streaming rights of WWE Network content. We also partner with Fox Network who carries the domestic television distribution of SmackDown, and the General Entertainment Authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who, among other things, hosts our live events in the Middle East.
Creative Development and Production
Our creative team, which is currently led by Paul Levesque, the Company’s Executive Vice President, Talent Relations and Creative, develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our premium live events. We voluntarily designate the suitability of each of our television shows using standard industry ratings, and all our in-ring television programming carries a PG rating, which is critical to maintaining the Company’s reputation for family friendly entertainment.
Our success is due primarily to the continuing popularity of our Superstars. We have nearly 250 Superstars under exclusive contracts, ranging from multi-year guaranteed contracts with established Superstars to developmental contracts with our Superstars in training. Our Superstars are highly trained and motivated independent contractors, whose compensation is tied to the revenue that they help generate. We own the rights to substantially all our characters and exclusively license the rights we do not own through agreements with our Superstars.
Talent Development
We continually seek to identify, recruit and develop additional talent for our business. Our development system, including the NXT division, features talent training to become WWE Superstars and has produced over 90% of our current active main roster stars, such as Roman Reigns, Riddle, Big E, Sasha Banks, Bianca Belair and the Street Profits. NXT has evolved into our third brand after Raw and SmackDown and has transitioned into a weekly live television series. Prior to COVID-19, NXT was also a global touring brand broadcasting live specials on WWE Network. More than 50% of our developmental talent come from countries outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, China, India, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Brazil and Germany. Women comprise approximately 35% of our developmental talent. NXT talent train at our WWE Performance Center in Florida, a state-of-the-art training facility, which was designed to cultivate our next generation of talent and has become the center of our talent development program. In efforts to localize our content around the world, we opened the WWE UK Performance Center in January 2019, the first WWE training facility outside of the United States. 




In December 2021, we launched a major recruiting initiative for in-ring competitors called Next In Line (“NIL”), announcing 15 college athletes from 13 universities, seven NCAA conferences, and four sports as part of the inaugural class.  These athletes will join Olympic gold medalist Gable Steveson in WWE’s first-of-its-kind NIL program. In addition to the United States, the class includes representation from a myriad of countries, including Canada and Nigeria. These athlete partnerships will feature access to the state-of-the-art WWE Performance Center in Orlando, in addition to resources across the organization, including brand building, media training, communications, live event promotion, creative writing and community relations. Upon completion of the NIL program, select athletes may earn an exclusive opportunity to be offered a WWE contract.
Competition
While we believe that we have a loyal fan base, the entertainment industry is highly competitive and subject to fluctuations in popularity, which are not easy to predict. For our live event and media content audiences, we face competition from professional and college sports, other live, filmed, televised and streamed entertainment, which includes other professional wrestling leagues, and other leisure activities. We will face increased competition from websites and mobile and other internet connected apps delivering paid and free content as streamed media offerings continue to expand. For purchases of our merchandise, we compete with entertainment companies, professional and college sports leagues and other makers of branded apparel and merchandise. Many companies with whom we compete have greater financial resources than we do.
Trademarks and Copyrights
Intellectual property is material to all aspects of our operations, and we expend substantial cost and effort in an attempt to maintain and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis-à-vis other parties’ intellectual property. We have a large portfolio of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks worldwide and maintain a large catalog of copyrighted works, including copyrights in our television and WWE Network programming, music, photographs, books, films and apparel art. We also own a large number of internet website domain names and operate a network of developed, content-based sites, which facilitate and contribute to the exploitation of our intellectual property worldwide.
We vigorously seek to enforce our intellectual property rights worldwide by, among other things, searching the internet to ascertain unauthorized use, seizing counterfeit goods and seeking restraining orders and/or damages in court against individuals or entities infringing our intellectual property rights. Our failure or inability to curtail piracy, infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights effectively, or our infringement of others’ intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our operating results.
Human Capital
The Company believes it has a talented, motivated, and dedicated team, and is committed to supporting the development of all of its team members and to continuously build on its strong culture. As of February 2022, the Company had approximately 870 full-time equivalent employees. We believe the relationship between WWE and our employees is strong. Our in-house production staff is supplemented with contract personnel for our television production who are not included in our headcount. Our employee headcount also excludes our Superstars and NXT talent, who are independent contractors.
Workplace Practices and Policies
The Company is committed to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status or other legally protected characteristics. In connection with its investigation, the Special Committee, through its legal counsel, has engaged a third-party consultant to partner with the Company’s management to conduct a comprehensive culture review and recommend human capital initiatives and best practices. The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity.
Compensation and Benefits
The Company believes that compensation should not only be competitive, it should be equitable and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits to employees around the world.
Inclusion and Diversity
The Company is committed to hiring inclusively, providing training and development opportunities, fostering an inclusive culture, and ensuring equitable pay for employees, and is continuing to focus on increasing diverse representation at every level of the Company.
Health and Safety
The Company is committed to protecting its employees everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential risks associated with workplace activities in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company has taken additional measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including providing information resources, testing, face masks and personal protective equipment, and case support. The Company also offers special sick leave for employees with possible COVID-19 symptoms, as well as comprehensive health coverage.
Regulation 
Live Events
In some United States and foreign jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for performers and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct our live events. If we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events in that jurisdiction. The inability to present our live events over an extended period of time, especially after the hiatus resulting from COVID-19, or in a number of jurisdictions could lead to a decline in the various revenue streams generated from our live events, which could adversely affect our operating results.
Television and WWE Network Programming
The marketplace for audio-visual programming (including cable television and Internet programming) in the United States and internationally is substantially affected by government regulations applicable to, as well as social and political influences on, television stations, television networks and cable and satellite television systems and channels. Certain Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulations are imposed directly on the Company and/or indirectly through our distributors. Other domestic and foreign governmental and private-sector initiatives relating to video programming are announced from time to time. In addition, the delivery of WWE Network in international markets exposes us to multiple regulatory frameworks, the complexity of which may result in unintentional noncompliance. One of our weekly television programs, SmackDown, is distributed via broadcast television on the Fox Network, and we are responsible, directly or indirectly, for compliance with certain additional FCC regulations and statutory requirements. Any failure by us to meet these governmental policies or regulations and private-sector expectations could restrict our program content and, in the case of government regulation, result in monetary liability. Such failure could also adversely affect our levels of viewership and/or number of WWE Network subscribers. Any of these could affect our operating results.
