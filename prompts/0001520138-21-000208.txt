Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Elvictor Group, Inc., f/k/a Thenablers, Inc. (Elvictor Group, Inc. or the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 3, 2017. The Company is an International Business Development Organization focused on the Design and Execution of New Market Strategies for its clients with the purpose of growing their brand and customer base. On December 13, 2019, the Company changed its name to Elvictor Group, Inc. in the state of Nevada. On February 27, 2020 FINRA approved the Corporate Action to change the name on OTC Markets and change the trading symbol to ELVG.
 
We are currently a development stage company and to date we have recorded minimal revenue. We have significant doubt in, our independent registered public accountants have issued a comment regarding our ability to continue as a going concern (please refer to the footnotes to the financial statements). Until such time that we are able to establish a consistent flow of revenues from our operations that is sufficient to sustain our operating needs, management intends to rely primarily upon debt financing to supplement cash flows, if any, that is generated by our services. We will seek out such financing as necessary to allow the Company to continue to grow our business operations, and to cover such cost, excluding professional fees, associated with being a reporting Company with the United States of America Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company has included such costs to become a publicly reporting company in its targeted expenses for working capital expenses and intends to seek out reasonable loans from friends, family and business acquaintances, if it becomes necessary. Up until this point time we have been funded by our founders and initial shareholders and have not received any firm commitments or indications from any family, friends or business acquaintances regarding any potential investment in the Company except those shareholders listed herein.
 
Crew Management Services
 
With the inclusion of the Elvictor brand and team, we look to grow our crew management services by providing unique information technology driven services to the international crew management marketplace. Our main scope of services will be focused on licensing, developing, and acquiring various technologies, platforms, and other unique artificial intelligence and data intelligence applications that will enhance our competitive and innovative toolbox. A toolbox of unique and proprietary services that should increase our differentiated services and values in enhancing our clients requirements. Furthermore, we shall consider the possibility of risk averse expansions by the Company through carefully selected perpendicularly or horizontally integrated acquisitions and minority or majority stake holdings in other ship management and/or services related companies. We may also look to explore additional opportunities related to lending and investment directly to ship operators in order to build our assets and provide new solutions for ship operations. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a self-sustaining company by increasing our revenues streams from a growing clientele and from varying investments that is built around introducing new technologies that can disrupt and change how ship and crew management is currently sourced, managed, developed, and performed in the ship and crew management marketplace.

Current Operations
 
Currently, we are in the process of onboarding new clients and have yet to see material revenues generated from these operations, as we want to ensure that we have the most efficient corporate structure in place to support growth, governance, and infrastructure. Our focus is presently on improving our recruitment models based on what we have determined to be the short comings of current recruitment models, utilizing disruptive technologies. In addition, we believe the opportunity is ripe for change and innovation, as the industry currently faces a shortage of seafaring labor. These shortages along with deficiencies in recruiting metrics have led to accidents and other mishaps. Currently, 80% of maritime accidents can be attributed to some form of human error. We look to use these deficiencies to improve our crew management capture of new business by demonstrating how our technologies can minimize the operating expenses and risks of the ship managers. We strongly believe that the game changer will be to not only recruit seafarers and provide skillful crew, but also to provide operational efficiency, cost and risk minimization, transparency of services, and information intelligence.
Competition and Landscape
 
Most of our large competitors are ship managers that do not provide crew management services, exclusively.
 
Shipping is largely ethnocentric in nature and the cultural norms largely govern the nature of the relationships between parties. Transparency of procedures and operations is a key purchasing criterion that principals adopt when choosing crew services. We believe that the Companys digitalization philosophy goes to provide this transparency in ways the industry currently doesnt have.
 
There are numerous small size manning agencies situated only in their countries of domicile (Ukraine, Sri-Lanka, Philippines, etc.), trying to approach global ship managers by providing under below market fees. Ship managers exploit the opportunity of being serviced at a lower price. However, it has been shown that in the long run, these local manning agencies do not possess the know-how and the capacity to serve their clients due to the complicated recruitment logistics, and due to the high demands of the clients. This creates complications for the ship managers own crew department that should handle various manning agencies, while also managing varied jurisdictional requirements, differing application forms, and multi-lingual communications to coordinate and control the overall recruitment. This complexity often times results in non-compliance with large ship owners and shippers, Institute of Supply and Demand (ISM) non-compliance, and may result in vessel detentions and rising claims.
 
Elvictors competitors have recently lost part of their fleet under management since they are characterized by the lack of IT innovation (while using outdated software solutions from software companies that have boxed the crewing business into a software that cannot be integrated with external applications) and by the low pricing and discount offers they provide that has proven to have an immediate impact on their quality of services.
 
If we are to classify our competitors, they can be segmented in two broad categories:
 
a)       Simple manning / crew management companies which provide isolated services encompassing ship personnel without expanding to more complicated logistics that are complementary to the recruitment process. These companies fail consistently to provide qualitative crew and cope with the complexity of the crew recruitment logistics/operations, due their small size and limited resources/reach. It is a fact that they lack digital organization, cutting edge connectivity, logistical know-how. Many of these companies are short lived, and those that survive do so due to below the market fees structure to secure clientele and complement their revenues with unethical and non-transparent strategies.
 
b)       Organizations which are supported by private funds and/or financial institutions mandated to invest in vessel acquisitions in exchange for crew, technical and overall ship management. These organizations form the top tier of the global competitors, who in turn fail due to their size and over complicated internal structure, which borne convoluted lines of communication and conflicting internal politics all at the expense of operational efficiency. Many Ship Owners/Managers resort to services from these large organizations believing that they are one-stop-shop, but ultimately the trade-off is in personal service and again lack-of-transparency due to a black-box service structure.

Our Companys competitive advantages are:
 
a)       Bespoke service structure tailor-made to the specific requirements of ship owners/managers making our IT infrastructure customized to the specific requirements as stipulated during our day-to-day collaboration.
 
b)       The Companys intranets provide a transparent and interactive ecosystem, bringing all parties (Ship Owner/Manager, Seafarer, Manning Office, Crew Manager) together to perform accurate and timely operations that are dictated by the Ship Owners/ Managers ISM Policy and procedures. This is attained by morphing the Ship Owners/ Managers ISM Policy and procedures into Elvictors online systems.
 
As a starting point, we plan to build from existing relationships with the Elvictor team, which have been created over 45 years of experience in the industry, which will allow the company to establish itself with little pressure from the markets. As we begin to grow our operations and venture into new products and solutions, we anticipate competitive pressures to increase, particularly from established firms that find our solutions disruptive.
 
Government Regulation
 
As crew management service providers, we are not directly governed by governmental regulators. However, we must, at all times, remain diligent in keeping abreast of changes in labor regulations, maritime regulations, and other trade regulations that affect our customers. In addition, as we begin to roll out additional products and solutions, we may find certain aspects of our operations fall under regulatory regimes governing the specific products or the Company as a whole. For example, if we begin to explore providing financial products, we may fall under certain banking or securities regulations. If our assets base meets certain thresholds of investment, we may be subject to Investment Company Act regulatory requirements.
Logistics Software
 
The Company is currently negotiating with a related party for the exclusive license to certain information technology and artificial intelligence software designed to increase efficiencies in crew and ship management operations. Under the exclusive license, as proposed, the Company would have exclusive worldwide rights to implement instances of crew and management artificial intelligent engines. Shipping, generally, tends to lag in areas of advanced technology and software solutions compared to other sectors of the vertical, such as domestic/international carriers, last mile carriers, and other direct to consumer goods transport. By implementing state of the art artificial intelligence systems, we believe we can distinguish ourselves as a leading provider of crew and ship management services and other logistics concerns in the industry.
Employees and Consultants
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 3 full time employees, not including our former Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Investor Relations Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer. The CFO and the CIRO have both resigned. We currently, as of the date of this report, have 12 full time employees, not including our CEO.
