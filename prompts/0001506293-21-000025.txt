Item 1. Business
Overview
Our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love.
Pinterest is where 459 million people around the world go to get inspiration for their lives. They come to discover ideas for just about anything you can imagine: daily activities like cooking dinner or deciding what to wear, major commitments like remodeling a house or training for a marathon, ongoing passions like fly fishing or fashion and milestone events like planning a wedding or a dream vacation.
We call these people Pinners. We show them visual recommendations, which we call Pins, based on their personal taste and interests. They then save and organize these recommendations into collections, called boards. Browsing and saving visual ideas on our service helps Pinners imagine what their future could look like, which helps them go from inspiration to action.
Pinterest is the productivity tool for planning your dreams. Dreaming and productivity may seem like polar opposites, but on Pinterest, inspiration enables action and dreams become reality. Visualizing the future helps bring it to life. In this way, Pinterest is unique. Most consumer internet companies are either tools (search, ecommerce) or media (newsfeeds, video, social networks). Pinterest is not a pure media channel; it is a media-rich utility.
Value Proposition for Pinners
Visual Experience. People often don’t have the words to describe what they want, but they know it when they see it. This is why we made Pinterest a visual experience. Images and video can communicate concepts that are impossible to describe with words. We believe that Pinterest is the best place on the web for people to get visual inspiration at scale. Visual searches are becoming more common on Pinterest, with hundreds of millions of visual searches per month. We have invested heavily in computer vision to help people discover possibilities that traditional text-based search queries cannot offer. The computer vision models we’ve developed “see” the content of each Pin and optimize billions of related recommendations daily to help people take action on the Pins they’ve found.
Personalization. Pinterest is a personalized, curated environment. Most Pins have been handpicked, saved and organized over the years by hundreds of millions of Pinners creating billions of boards. As of December 31, 2020, our Pinners saved nearly 300 billion Pins across more than six billion boards. We call this body of data the Pinterest taste graph. Machine learning and computer vision help us find patterns in the data. We then understand each individual Pin’s relationship not just to the Pinner who saved it, but also to the ideas and aesthetics reflected by the names and content of the boards where it’s been pinned. We believe we can better predict what content will be helpful and relevant because Pinners tell us how they organize ideas. The Pinterest taste graph is the first-party data asset we use to power our visual recommendations.
When people organize ideas into collections on Pinterest, they are sharing how they contextualize that idea. When we scale human curation across hundreds of millions of Pinners saving nearly 300 billion Pins, we believe our taste graph and recommendations get exponentially better. The more people use Pinterest, the richer the taste graph gets, and the more an individual uses Pinterest, the more personalized their home feed becomes. 
Designed for Action. People use Pinterest to visualize their future and to make their dreams a reality. Our goal is for each Pin to link back to a useful source—everything from a product to buy, ingredients for a recipe or instructions to complete a project. We have built features that encourage Pinners to take action on ideas they see on Pinterest, with a special focus on making it easy for people to purchase products they discover on our service.
Inspiring Environment. Pinners describe Pinterest as an inspiring place where they can focus on themselves, their interests and their future. We encourage positivity on the platform through our policies and product development -- for example, Pinterest has banned political ads, developed inclusive beauty search functionality and rolled out compassionate search for Pinners seeking mental health support. This work is an important part of our value proposition because people are less likely to dream about their future when they feel self-conscious, excluded, unhappy or preoccupied with the problems of the day. 
Value Proposition for Advertisers
Valuable Audience. Pinterest reaches 459 million monthly active users, about two-thirds of whom are female. The value of Pinterest’s audience to advertisers is driven not merely by the number of Pinners on our platform or their demographics, but also by the reason they come to Pinterest in the first place. Getting inspiration for your home, your style or your travel often means that you are actively looking for products and services to buy. Billions of searches happen on Pinterest every month. Commercial content from brands, retailers and advertisers is central to Pinterest. This means that relevant ads don’t compete with native content on Pinterest; instead, they are content. The mutually beneficial alignment between advertisers and Pinners differentiates us from other platforms where ads (even relevant ads) can be distracting or annoying. We are still in the early stages of building an advertising product suite that fully taps the value of this alignment between Pinners and advertisers, but we believe it will be a competitive advantage over the long term.
Inspiration to Action. Pinners use our service to get inspiration for things they want to do and buy in their real lives. This journey from ideation to action takes them down the entire purchasing “funnel”, so our advertisers have the opportunity to put relevant promoted content in front of Pinners at every stage of the purchasing journey—when they are browsing through many possibilities without a clear idea of what they want, when they have identified and are comparing a handful of options and when they are ready to make a purchase. As a result, advertisers can achieve a range of awareness and performance objectives on Pinterest.
Inspiring Environment. Advertisers are in the business of inspiration. On Pinterest, businesses have the opportunity to showcase their products and services in an inspiring, creative environment. This is rare on the internet, where consumers’ digital experiences can be stressful or negative, and brands can get caught in the crossfire. We believe that the inspirational and constructive feelings that many people experience on Pinterest make our site an especially effective environment for brands and creators to build an emotional connection with consumers.
Our Pinner Products
Pins
People come to Pinterest because it is filled with billions of great ideas. Each idea is represented by a Pin. Pins can be created or saved by individual users or by businesses. 
When an individual user finds content like an article, image or video on the web and wants to save it, she can use our browser extension or Save button to save a link to that idea to a board of a larger topic, along with an image representing the idea. They can also save ideas within Pinterest as they get inspiration for ideas others have found. Additionally, we are in the early days of introducing Story Pins, which enable creators to create Pins featuring their own original work, like a recipe they made, a beauty, style or home decor tutorial, or a travel guide. When people click on a Pin, they can learn more and act on it.
Businesses also create Pins on our platform in the form of both organic content and paid advertisements. We believe the addition of organic content from merchants adds significant value to the experience of both Pinners and advertisers, as we believe Pinners come with the intent to try something new, and welcome content from brands. We expect that these Pins will become an even larger part of our content in the future.
We have several types of Pins on our platform to inspire people and help them take action, including standard Pins, Product Pins, collections, Video Pins and Story Pins. More types of Pins and features will come in the future.
•Standard Pins: Images with links back to original content from around the web, used to highlight products, recipes, style and home inspiration, DIY, and more.
•Product Pins: Product Pins make items shoppable with up-to-date pricing, information about availability and links that go directly to the checkout page of a retailer’s website.
•Collections: Collections allow Pinners to shop for the individual products they see in the inspiring scenes on fashion and home decor Pins.
•Video Pins: Video Pins are short videos on topics like how-to content about cooking, beauty and DIY that help Pinners more deeply engage by watching an idea come alive.
•Story Pins: Story Pins are multi-page videos, images, text and lists that are natively created on Pinterest. This format enables creators to show how to bring ideas to life (e.g. how to cook a meal or design a room).
Planning
Boards are where Pinners save and organize Pins into collections around a topic. Every new Pin saved by a user must be saved onto a particular board and is associated with a particular context (such as “bedroom rug ideas,” “electric bikes” or “healthy kids’ snacks”). Once the Pin has been saved, it exists on the board of the Pinner who saved it, but it also joins the billions of Pins available for other Pinners to discover and save to their own boards. Pinners access their boards in their profile and organize them however they prefer.
Pinners can create sections in a board to better organize Pins. For example, a “Quick Weekday Meals” board could have sections like “breakfast,” “lunch,” “dinner” and “desserts.” A board can be made visible to anyone on Pinterest or kept private so only the Pinner can see it. As Pinners plan projects, like a home renovation or a wedding, they can invite others on Pinterest to a shared group board. When a Pinner follows another person on Pinterest, they can choose to follow a select board or their entire account.
Discovery
People go to Pinterest to discover the best ideas to bring into their lives. They do this by exploring the home feed and search tools on our service. 
•Home Feed: When people open Pinterest, they see their home feed, which is where they will find Pins that are relevant to their interests based in part on their recent activity. Home Feed discovery is powered by machine learning recommendations based on previous activity and the overlapping interests of Pinners with similar taste. They will also see Pins from the people, topics and boards they choose to follow. Every home feed is personalized to dynamically reflect the taste and interests of the Pinner.
•Search: 
◦Text queries: Pinners can search for Pins, broad ideas, boards, or people by typing in the search bar. Pinners who use search typically want to see many relevant possibilities that are personalized for their individual taste and interests rather than one perfect answer. Often, Pinners start by typing in something general like “dinner ideas,” then use Pinterest’s built-in search guides (like “weekday” or “family”) to narrow down the results. 
◦Visual queries: When a Pinner taps on a Pin to learn more about an idea or image, a feed of visually similar Pins is served beneath the tapped image. These related Pins help Pinners springboard off a point of inspiration to explore deeper into an interest or narrow in on the perfect idea. Pinners also search within images by using our Lens tool to select specific objects inside an inspiring scene e.g., a lamp in a living room scene or a pair of shoes in a street fashion scene. This action automatically triggers a new search that yields related Pins that are visually similar to the specific object. This is powered by years of computer vision that can identify objects and attributes within scenes.
•Shopping: Pinterest is where people turn inspiration into action, as Pinners plan, save, and find things to buy that inspire them to create a life they love. We are building a place to shop online—not just a place to find things to buy.
Our Advertising Products
Pinners’ desire to discover something they love and make it part of their life is aligned with the motivations of our advertisers. Products and services often help bring dreams to life. Pinterest can help businesses reach a Pinner from the moment he starts thinking about what he wants his living room to look like to the moment when he is about to purchase a couch at his price point. We’ve understood this alignment since our founding, and we’re building an ad product suite that drives value for our users and advertisers simultaneously.
We offer both brand and performance ads, with performance representing approximately two thirds of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Brand revenue is billed when an advertiser optimizes an ad campaign around “brand” objectives like impressions or video views. Performance revenue is billed when an advertiser optimizes an ad campaign around “performance” objectives like clicks or conversion events.
Because Pinners travel down the entire purchasing funnel on Pinterest, our ad product suite is used by different advertisers to meet different objectives, including awareness, consideration and sales. 
Awareness Objective.
Pinterest ads appear in the home feed and on search results pages. They echo the visual style of organic Pins and are fully integrated into the design. A Pinner sees ads as he scrolls through his home feed and search results, looking for inspiration and ideas.
Consideration and Sales Objectives.
When a Pinner clicks on an ad, he sees an intermediate screen that gives him a closer view of the ad creative as well as the option to save the ad to a board. He will also be able to swipe up or click to see the advertiser’s online presence, where he can pursue deeper consideration (by exploring available products and services or signing-up for memberships) and potentially transact.
Ad Formats
•Standard ad: A static image used to showcase content in a simple vertical image format.
•Video ad: Used by advertisers to capture attention and tell a story with a visually engaging format. We currently offer three video ad formats: standard video, performance video and max width video.
•Shopping ad: Similar to a standard ad, used to reach people when they are deciding what to buy. Shopping ads are exclusive to advertisers who upload their product catalog to Pinterest. 
•Carousel ad: Multiple static or video in one carousel, used by advertisers to showcase more than one image or video at a time.
•Collection ad: Used by advertisers to display products in action with a hybrid format that mixes lifestyle imagery with featured products.
Our Advertising System
Ad Auction
All advertisers on Pinterest buy ads through an auction-based system. Our ad auction allows us to serve ads to Pinners at relevant moments while optimizing business outcomes for advertisers. Our auction system selects the best ad for each available ad impression, based on the likelihood of a desired action occurring and how much that action is worth to advertisers. The likelihood of the action occurring depends on a variety of factors, such as targeting relevance and creative. Today, our advertisers can optimize their campaigns around four different types of user activity depending on their objectives: impressions ("CPM"), video views ("CPV"), clicks ("CPC"), and conversion events ("oCPM") such as checkout or add to cart.
Targeting
Ad targeting helps businesses reach the millions of people who come to Pinterest to find or shop for products and services.
Advertisers can target their messages to specific demographics (locations, languages, gender, age), device types, audiences (such as existing customers or Pinners who recently engaged with their content) and interests or keywords. Advertisers can also choose whether they want ads to show in Pinners’ search surfaces, home feed or both.
Because ads are content on Pinterest, ad relevance is powered by the same principles that drive organic recommendations. We are building ad products that will allow advertisers to target ads based on a particular consumer’s known aesthetic preferences and style. Eventually we expect to be able to leverage the Pinterest taste graph to match ad creative to a Pinner’s individual taste and interests.
Measurement
Measuring the effectiveness of digital spend is a high priority for our advertisers. Our measurement solutions are aligned to help advertisers recognize the value of an investment on our platform across a variety of objectives. We enable our advertisers to meet their awareness, consideration and conversion objectives with a number of first-party tools to measure campaign effectiveness. We also have leading third-party measurement partners to validate Pinterest’s performance and measure advertiser results.
Sales and Marketing
Our Go-to-Market Approach
The Pinterest platform enables a diverse group of advertisers to achieve a wide range of objectives. We serve these advertisers in customized ways across their size, product needs and measurement objectives. We initially built our business with large consumer packaged goods ("CPG") and retail advertisers in the United States who typically have large marketing budgets and had the greatest affinity for our core use cases at that time. We then scaled our sales force to support these advertisers and grew their spend with us over time while broadening the mix of advertisers across verticals. 
As these advertisers scaled their investment on our platform, we have increased our focus on building the product and measurement tools required to serve mid-market and unmanaged advertisers. We have also begun to focus on expanding our international advertiser base. 
Marketing
To date, we have been able to grow our global user base with relatively low marketing costs. User acquisition has been driven by the strength of our global brand and the utility of our service as well as by unpaid search engine traffic. We continue to test additional marketing efforts including paid marketing campaigns focused on user and advertiser acquisition efforts.
Our Technology Innovation
We believe we have one of the largest image-rich data sets ever assembled. This lets us analyze trends, understand intent and predict consumer behavior. And, we are just scratching the surface of what is possible. Looking ahead, we are excited about new technical challenges, including fine-grained image recognition, object-to-object visual search and large-scale visual search infrastructure.
Our Competition
We primarily compete with consumer internet companies that are either tools (search, ecommerce) or media (newsfeeds, video, social networks). We compete with larger, more established companies such as Amazon, Facebook (including Instagram), Google (including YouTube), Snap, TikTok and Twitter. Many of these companies have significantly greater financial and human resources. We also face competition from smaller companies in one or more high-value verticals, including Allrecipes, Houzz and Tastemade, that offer users engaging content and commerce opportunities through similar technology or products to ours. We remain focused on emerging competition as well. We face competition across almost every aspect of our business, particularly users and engagement, advertising and talent.
Users and Engagement
We compete to attract, engage and retain users and their time and attention. Because our products and those of our competitors are typically free, we compete based on our brand, product experience, quality, utility and ease of use of our products. For more information on users and engagement trends, see section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Advertising
We compete for advertising revenue across a variety of formats. We believe our ability to compete effectively depends on the effectiveness of our service in reaching users early in the decision-making process, amplifying advertisers’ messages and delivering compelling returns on investment. This is driven by a number of factors, including our reach, relevance and engagement, as well as our brand and advertising products, delivery and measurement capabilities and other offerings. For more information on trends relating to advertising revenue and growth, see section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Talent
We compete to attract and retain highly talented individuals, particularly people with expertise in computer vision, artificial intelligence and machine learning. We believe we compete for these potential employees by providing a work environment that offers the opportunity to work on challenging, cutting-edge and inspirational products. For more information, see “Talent Management and Development” below.
Intellectual Property
Our success is tied in part to our ability to protect our intellectual property and key technological innovations. We rely on a combination of federal, state and common-law rights in the United States and rights under the laws of other countries, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names and other intellectual property rights to help protect our brand and proprietary technologies. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology and to preserve our rights thereto. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had over 340 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and foreign countries relating to aspects of our actual or contemplated operations and technologies. We also had over 550 registered trademarks and trademark applications in the United States and foreign countries, including our “Pinterest” name and related logos. 
We are also dependent on third-party content, technology and intellectual property in connection with our business. 
We are presently involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and expect to continue to face allegations from third parties, including our competitors and “non-practicing entities,” that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights.
For additional information on risks relating to intellectual property, please see the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “—Legal Proceedings.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to many U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations that involve data privacy and data protection, intellectual property (including copyright and patent laws), content regulation, rights of publicity, advertising, marketing, health and safety, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions or securities law compliance. Our business may also be affected by the adoption of any new or existing laws or regulations or changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, or that significantly restrict or impose conditions on our ability to collect, store, augment, analyze, use and share data or increase consumer notice or consent requirements before a company can utilize cookies or other tracking technologies or that increase the liability of content platforms like us. Many relevant laws and regulations are still evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created or amended in a manner that could harm our business, and new laws and regulations may be enacted, including in connection with the restriction or prohibition of certain content or business activities. For example, EU member states are in the process of implementing the EU Copyright Directive, which may impose significant new burdens on content platforms like us. 
We rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses relevant to the content available on our service, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”) and the fair-use doctrine in the United States, and the Electronic Commerce Directive in the European Union. In addition, there are newly adopted and pending legislations in the European Union that may impose additional obligations or liability on us associated with content uploaded by users to our platform. 
We receive, process, store, use and share data, some of which contains personal information. We are therefore subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy and the collection, storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data from users, employees or business partners, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). These laws expand the rights of individuals to control how their personal data is processed, collected, used and shared creates new regulatory and operational requirements for processing personal data, increases requirements for security and confidentiality and provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. There are also a number of legislative proposals recently enacted or pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislatures and foreign governments concerning content regulation and data protection that could affect us. These and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply.
Government authorities outside the United States may also seek to restrict access to or block our service, prohibit or block the hosting of certain content available through our service or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of our service in that country for a period of time or even indefinitely. For example, access to our service has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, India, Kazakhstan and Turkey. In addition, some countries have enacted laws that allow websites to be blocked for hosting certain types of content or may require websites to remove certain restricted content.
For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “—Legal Proceedings.”
Seasonality 
We experience seasonality in user growth, engagement and monetization on our platform. Historically, we have had lower engagement in the second calendar quarter, though we did not experience typical seasonal trends and saw an increase in active user growth in the second quarter of 2020 due to shelter-in-place orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industry advertising spend tends to be strongest in the fourth quarter, and we observe a similar pattern in our historical advertising revenue. Significant user and monetization growth has partially offset these trends in historical periods, and thus we expect the impact of seasonality to be more pronounced in the future.
Talent Management and Development
In order to fulfill our mission of bringing everyone the inspiration to create a life they love, we strive to attract and retain top talent. To attract and retain great talent, we strive to create opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. As of December 31, 2020, we had 2,545 full-time employees. 
Inclusion and Diversity
We strive to create an inclusive and diverse workplace where employees are empowered to bring their whole, authentic selves to work every day. We seek for and respect diverse perspectives which can only help us create a more inclusive and diverse product. 
We seek inclusion and diversity at the highest level in our organization. Our board of directors includes directors from various backgrounds, industries, skills and experience. Our board of ten directors comprises eight independent directors, four women and is racially diverse. Our leadership team includes leaders with diverse skills, experience, racial backgrounds and gender. To further our commitment to create an inclusive and diverse culture, we appointed Tyi McCray as our Global Head of Inclusion and Diversity reporting directly to our CEO. We also added three new independent directors with diverse backgrounds to our board of directors in 2020.
Annually, we’ve published a diversity report since 2015 which we make publicly available on our website. We believe it is important to hold ourselves accountable to creating a diverse workforce. Our diversity report currently includes our annual hiring goals and how we performed against the goals and our workforce demographic data. 
We have also created employee resource groups that are aligned around dimensions of diversity, such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other shared attributes, which we believe help build community and enable opportunities for development. 
In June 2020, subsequent to concerns raised by current and former employees, our board of directors established a Special Committee of the board of directors to independently review Pinterest’s workplace culture. The Special Committee engaged experienced outside counsel to advise the Special Committee in connection with its independent review and to help develop recommendations to further support an inclusive, fair, and respectful workplace. In December 2020, we began implementing the recommendations of the Special Committee. 
Employee health, safety and benefits
The success of our business is fundamentally tied to the well-being of our people. We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes currently having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include equity awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, flexible paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, charitable donation matching, among many others. 
Learning and development 
We help our employees create a career that is inspiring, impactful and ultimately time well spent. We have programs for open and ongoing conversation towards career growth goals both long term and short term. We also have workshops dedicated to learning new skills and developing an employee’s career. We set aside a dedicated personal learning and development budget for every employee.
