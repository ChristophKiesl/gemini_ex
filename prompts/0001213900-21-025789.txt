ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
 
BoxScore Brands, Inc. (formerly U-Vend Inc.) (the “Company”) most recently has developed, marketed and distributed various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. The Company had placed its kiosks in high-traffic host locations such as big box stores, restaurants, malls, airports, casinos, universities, and colleges. Currently, the Company is exploring opportunities to best utilize the equipment remaining after a sale of assets noted below.
 
Due to the recent closures and lockdowns, the Company has worked with its creditors to return the underutilized equipment and save the Company substantial costs in current and future expenditures. This is allowing the Company to focus on continuing their long lasting relationships with their partners and also to free up capital to explore new business opportunities and ventures.
 
On February 26, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation. The Certificate of Amendment changed its name to BoxScore Brands, Inc. from U-Vend Inc., to better reflect the nature of the Company’s then current business operations, which has expanded to include relationships with major sports organizations dispensing ice cream products through vending machines.
 
Asset Sale
 
On March 18, 2019, the Company approved an asset sale of the assets related to the legacy MiniMelts brand for $350,000 in cash, which was approved by a majority of its shareholders. These MiniMelts assets generated 100% of the revenue reported during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, MiniMelts sales accounted for approximately $1,100,000, or 85%, of the revenue reported during that period. Part of the proceeds from the sale was used to retire certain lease obligations as well as for general operating purposes.
 
The Company is evaluating opportunities and expects to leverage its remaining vending assets to pursue new revenue streams and test concepts for new offerings at retail. Also, the Board of Directors had agreed to begin to explore the development of certain products in the cannabis industry with a focus on non-THC Cannabinoids in frozen desserts as well as other complementary CBD product offerings though vending as well as online sales and direct to retail, under a new brand. Current market conditions and a global pandemic has negatively affected management’s original go-to-market strategy and has forced the company to reevaluate all market opportunities.
 
Distribution
 
The Company distributed novelty ice cream products, MLB Ice Cream and Nightfood frozen desserts, through a network of automated retail vending kiosks and reach in freezers. On April 25, 2019 the Company signed a distribution agreement with Pellequr, LLC for the distribution and marketing of CBD salves, tinctures, bath products and vape pens.
 
Our main distribution partner for our CBD products, Neiman Marcus, filed for bankruptcy and no longer carries our products.
 
Other Operational Matters
 
The Company’s marketing activities are conducted through sales representatives. Raw materials used in the Company’s operations are widely available but are purchased from a limited number of sources to obtain favorable prices and terms. Refocusing our resources will allow the Company to broaden our relationships and operate in a more cost-effective fashion.
