Background
 
Kaya Holdings, Inc., was incorporated in Delaware in 1993 under the name Gourmet Market, Inc. and has engaged in a number of businesses. Its name was changed on May 11, 2007 to Netspace International Holdings, Inc. (“Netspace”). Netspace acquired 100% of the capital stock of Alternative Fuels Americas, Inc., a Florida corporation in January 2010 in a stock for stock transaction and issued 100,000 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock to existing shareholders of the Florida corporation. The Company’s name was changed in October 2010 from Netspace International Holdings, Inc. to Alternative Fuels Americas, Inc.
 
From 2010 through 2014 the Company was engaged in seeking to develop a biofuels business. In January 2015, the Company determined that it was in the best interests of its stockholders to discontinue its biofuel development activities, and to instead leverage its agricultural and business development experience and focus all its resources on the development of legal medical and recreational marijuana opportunities in the United States and in select international markets.
 
In January of 2014 KAYS incorporated a subsidiary, Marijuana Holdings Americas, Inc. a Florida corporation (“MJAI”). Through entities controlled by MJAI, KAYS has focused on the development of opportunities within the legal recreational and medical marijuana sectors in the United States. In March 2014, MJAI, subsidiary, applied for and was awarded its first license to operate a Medical Marijuana Dispensary (an “MMD”). The Company developed the Kaya Shack™ brand for its retail operations and on July 3, 2014 opened its first Kaya Shack™ Medical Marijuana Dispensary in Portland, Oregon, thereby becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to own and operate an MMD. Initial customer acceptance and media coverage was very positive, including many references to KAYS as the “Starbucks of Medical Marijuana” by television news stations, news print publications and online news sources. In March 2015, the Company changed its name to Kaya Holdings, Inc. to better reflect its new plan of operations. 
 
In April 2015 KAYS commenced its own medical marijuana grow operations for the cultivation and harvesting of legal marijuana thereby becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to own a majority interest in a vertically integrated legal marijuana enterprise in the United States. In October 2015, concurrent with Oregon commencing legal sales of recreational marijuana through MMDs, KAYS opened its second retail operation in Salem, Oregon, the Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore. Oregon. During 2015, the Company also consolidated its grow operations and manufacturing operations into a single facility in Portland, Oregon.
 
Recent Developments
 
OLCC Licensing
 
In 2016, Oregon began the process to transition legal marijuana sales from Oregon Health Authority (“OHA”) licensed MMDs and grow operations to Oregon Liquor Control Commission (“OLCC”) licensed recreational marijuana retailers and producer and processing facilities. Effective January 1, 2017, all retailers of recreational marijuana were required to have a recreational marijuana sales license issued by the OLLC for each retail outlet operated. The Company applied for OLLC licenses for its two initial Kaya Shack™ retail outlets and received an OLCC recreational license for its existing South Salem Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore prior to the January 1, 2017 deadline. However, issuance of the OLCC license for the Portland, Oregon outlet was delayed because of the need to resolve various local issues with the City of Portland. Accordingly, from January 1, 2017 until the present, sales at the Portland, Oregon location were limited to medical marijuana.
 
On January 20, 2017, we entered into an agreement whereby the City of Portland agreed to license our Portland Kaya Shack™ retail outlet. Since that time, we completed all OLCC Licensing requirements, on March 29, 2017 passed our retail license inspection and expect to receive our OLCC recreational license for the Portland Kaya Shack™ outlet by not later than April 30, 2017, at which time, we will be able to commence legal recreational marijuana sales at that location.

Additional Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores
 
During 2016, the Company focused a significant portion of its efforts on developing two additional Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores, including identifying and leasing suitable locations, completing necessary build out and applying for the requisite OLCC recreational marijuana retailer licenses. On March 21, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured the OLCC recreational retailer marijuana license and had opened its third retail outlet, a 2,600 square foot Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore in North Salem, Oregon. We are completing construction of and the OLCC licensing process for our fourth outlet, a third Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore, which will be located in Central Salem, Oregon and which we anticipate will open during the second quarter of 2017. In addition to the four Kaya Shack™ retail marijuana stores described above, the Company plans to identify and lease locations for, license and seek to open up to four additional Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores in other Oregon markets over the next eighteen to twenty-four months, as well as explore opportunities in other states to increase its retail footprint. Additionally, the Company is exploring opportunities to further its operation in Oregon and elsewhere through the acquisition of currently licensed and operating retail operations, which can be converted to the Kaya Shack™ model.
Expansion of Grow and Manufacturing Operations
 
On March 21, 2017, KAYS announced that it was in the process of expanding its grow and manufacturing operations and had retained a realtor to assist in identifying a suitable 30-60 acre tract of land in Oregon which would permit KAYS to expand its grow operations to the maximum space currently allowed by law utilizing a mix of indoor and greenhouse cultivation. KAYS believes that the acquisition of a property will position the Company for future development, including increased Marijuana Canopy production, development of marijuana processing facilities and other cannabis related endeavors (subject to local zoning restrictions or liberalization of restrictions). As part of this expansion, KAYS ceased operations of its Portland grow facility at the end of March 2017, arranged to maintain its genetics library of over 30 strains of cannabis at an OHA-licensed medical grow site and contracted with farmers to meet demand until the new facility is secured, built and fully operational.
$2.1 Million Financing
 
In March 2017, the Company completed a $2.1 million financing with an institutional investor (the “Investor”) who had previously furnished KAYS with $1.2 million in financing, pursuant to a financing agreement (the “Financing Agreement”) entered into between the Company and the Investor in December 2016. Pursuant to the Financing Agreement, the Investor purchased $2.1 million in principal amount of convertible notes (the “Notes”) from the Company as follows:
 

• | $400,000 in principal amount of Notes which are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.04; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $700,000 in principal amount of Notes which are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.07; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $1,000,000 in principal amount of Notes which are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.10. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The purchase price for the Notes is equal to the principal amount thereof. The Notes have a term of two years from issuance and bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) annum, which accrues and is payable to together with interest at maturity. The Investor may convert the principal amount of the Notes (as well as other notes it currently holds as referenced above), together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon, into shares at the applicable conversion price, at any time or from time to time prior to maturity. The conversion price is subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar transactions. The Notes also provide that at no time may they be convertible if the number of shares being issued upon conversion to and then held by the Investor would result in the Investor beneficially owning in excess of 4.99% of the Company’s then outstanding shares of common stock, after giving effect to the proposed conversion. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Investor has not converted any of the Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock.

The Notes were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D thereunder. The proceeds from the offer and sale of Notes are and will be used to fund the Company’s 2017 growth plan, including expansion of our chain of Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores in Oregon, expansion of our marijuana grow facility and manufacturing operations and introducing new Kaya Shack™ branded cannabis products.
 
Corporate Information

Market Overview
 
Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana in some capacity. Additionally, eight states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington State) and Washington, DC have approved the implementation of legal recreational marijuana use, with active legal cannabis economies flourishing in Colorado, Oregon and Washington. As Melia Robinson of Business Insider stated, “After a historic election cycle, which saw four states pass ballot initiatives legalizing nonmedical marijuana, one in five Americans now live in a state where it's legal to smoke weed without a doctor's letter.”
 
According to cannabis research firm Arcview, sales of legal marijuana in North America rose by 34% to $6.9 billion in 2016, and based on estimates from investment firm Cowen & Co., U.S. legal sales could reach $50 billion by 2026. For added context, ArcView estimates that North American black market sales totaled $46.4 billion last year.
 
Arcview projects sales will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 25% through 2021, when the North American market is expected to top $20.2 billion in sales. "The only consumer industry categories I've seen reach $5 billion in annual spending and then post anything like 25% compound annual growth in the next five years are cable television (19%) in the 1990s and the broadband internet (29%) in the 2000s," Tom Adams, editor in chief of Arcview Market Research, said in a statement.
 
Estimates from various sources for the size of the long term market range from up to an excess of $100 billion if Federal Prohibition is repealed and marijuana sales become legal in all 50 states and Washington D.C. (for perspective beer is approximately a $100 billion market, with wine just under $30 billion and coffee approximately $12 billion).
 
The Kaya Shack™ Brand

-

Kaya Holdings operates the Kaya Shack™ brand of medical marijuana dispensaries and recreational marijuana stores.
 
Kaya Holdings operates three recreational marijuana retail outlets and medical marijuana dispensaries in Oregon under the Kaya Shack™ and anticipates opening a fourth location during the second quarter of 2017. In addition to these four Kaya Shack™ retail marijuana stores, the Company plans to identify and lease locations for, license and seek to open up to four additional Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores in other Oregon markets over the next eighteen to twenty-four months, as well as explore opportunities in other states to increase its retail footprint. Additionally, the Company is exploring opportunities to further its operation in Oregon and elsewhere through the acquisition of currently licensed and operating retail operations, which can be converted to the Kaya Shack™ model.
 
Dubbed by the mainstream press as the “Starbucks of Marijuana” after our first outlet opened in July, 2014, our operating concept is simple to deliver a consistent customer experience (quality products, fair prices and superior customer service) to a broad and diverse base of customers. Kaya Shack™ meets the quality needs of the “marijuana enthusiast”, the comfort and atmosphere of all including “soccer moms” and the price sensitivities of casual smokers.
 
The Kaya Shack™ brand communicates positive thinking and joy, with signs adorning the walls that read “It’s a Good Day to have a Good Day,” “Some of our Happiest Days Haven’t Even Happened Yet,” and our signature “Be Kind.”
 
Kaya Shack™ retail outlets are open 7 days a week from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm. Operations follow an operational manual that details procedures for 18 areas of operation including safety, compliance, store opening, store closing, merchandising, handling of cash, inventory control, product intake, store appearance and employee conduct.
 
In compliance with regulations, all marijuana and marijuana infused products sold through our stores are quality tested by independent labs to assure adherence to strict quality and purity standards.

The Portland facility rotates through approximately 100 different strains throughout the year and in any given month features over 35 popular strains of marijuana including our proprietary, high-grade “Kaya Kush” (independent testing performed on 3/10/2016 confirms a total THC/Cannabinoid content of approximately 28%). Our stores also feature various concentrates, including butane hash oil (B.H.O.) and CO2 oil extract (wax, shatter) which range in potency from approximately 40% to over 80% THC, as well as high grade Oils and Tinctures, high CBD – low THC strains and “Kaya Candies”, “Kaya Caramels” and an assortment of cookies and cakes for patients who do not smoke.
 
Our Portland store initially operated as an MMD. In connection with the transition of recreational marijuana retailer licenses from the OHA to the OLCC, we applied for an OLCC license for the facility. However, issuance of the OLCC license for the Portland, Oregon outlet was delayed because of the need to resolve various local issues with the City of Portland. Accordingly, from January 1, 2017 until the present, sales at the Portland, Oregon location were limited to medical marijuana.
 
On January 20, 2017, we entered into an agreement whereby the City of Portland agreed to license our Portland Kaya Shack™ retail outlet. Since that time, we completed all OLCC Licensing requirements, on March 29, 2017 passed our retail license inspection and expect to receive our OLCC recreational license for the Portland Kaya Shack™ outlet by not later than April 30, 2017, at which time, we will be able to commence legal recreational marijuana sales at that location.

Our second retail outlet (and our first Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore) opened for business on October 17, 2015 in South Salem, Oregon in time to take advantage of early recreational sales by MMDs.
 
The store is located in first class strip mall space adjacent to “Little Caesars Pizza” and “Aaron Rents”, with a footprint roughly three times the size of our first Kaya Shack™ outlet in Portland. The location and floor plan was carefully chosen with an eye towards concept expansion to enhance revenues and broaden branding opportunities.
 
In addition to the recreational and medical marijuana products as offered at our Hawthorne location, the space allows for additional products and concept innovations to be introduced. These include the Kaya Café Juice Bar ™ (featuring THC and CBD enhanced juices and beverages), the Kaya Clone Room ™ (supplying marijuana plants and home cultivation accessories) and additional unique on-site concepts.
 
Our South Salem Kaya Shack™ Marijuana superstore received its OLCC recreational marijuana retailer license prior to the January 1, 2017 deadline to do so.

As with the South Salem Store, the location is first class space, adjacent to Starbucks Coffee. This is our largest location to date and is intended to be the model for future Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores. We selected this location with an eye towards completing market penetration of the Salem Metropolitan Area, which hosts a population of approximately 400,000 people. We also intend to expand our product offerings here as well as utilize the additional space to host community events we hope will help make the Kaya Shack™ a destination for cannabis consumers.

Kaya Shack™ Home Delivery 
 





18
--



In early February of 2017, the Company began the process of filing applications to add Home Delivery Service for three of its Kaya Shack™ retail marijuana stores at the advice of one of their OLCC examiners. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has received approvals from the OLCC to add Home Delivery to their two currently OLCC licensed locations, expects to receive approval for Home Delivery at its third location in conjunction with the anticipated issuance of its OLCC location license and is also applying for Home Delivery licensing at its fourth retail outlet, which is currently under construction.
 
In addition to providing added value and convenience for our customers, extending visibility and building brand recognition for the Kaya Shack™ brand, we believe that Home Delivery provides greater market penetration, by allowing sales throughout the geographic area that our stores are licensed in. There is no limit to the number of delivery vehicles that can service an individual area using just one store as a home base, so in effect we intend to use this service to construct additional “virtual” Kaya Shacks™ without the added costs of additional brick and mortar locations.
 
On April 11, 2017 the Company took delivery of its first four Fiat 500 cars to begin building their Kaya Car™ Home Delivery Service fleet. The cars are presently being customized with distinctive Kaya Shack™ vehicle wrapping featuring the Company’s branding logos and colors, and the Company is developing the Kaya Shack™ Delivery App for use by its customers to order “Fast, Free Delivery” of the complete line of both medical and recreational grade Kaya Shack™ cannabis products.
 
The Company intends to initiate its Kaya Car™ Home Delivery Service within the next 30-60 days, contemporaneously with a grand opening celebration for all four then OLCC-Licensed Kaya Shack™ retail marijuana stores and to commence the to move to the next stage of branding and retail development.

Kaya Farms™ Cannabis and Cannabis Products
 
General
 






Since April 2015, Kaya Holdings has developed, operated and expanded its Kaya Farms™ West Coast Base of Operations, housing marijuana grow operations and a manufacturing facility. These operations enabled us to develop over 30 strains of cannabis and to provide ours Kaya Shack™ retail outlets with top grade connoisseur quality marijuana products including flower, concentrates and extracts.
 


On March 21, 2017, KAYS announced that it was in the process of expanding its grow and manufacturing operations and had retained a realtor to assist in identifying a suitable 30-60 acre tract of land in Oregon which would permit KAYS to expand its grow operations to the maximum space currently allowed by law utilizing a mix of indoor and greenhouse cultivation. KAYS believes that the acquisition of a property will position the Company for future development, including increased Marijuana Canopy production, development of marijuana processing facilities and other cannabis related endeavors (subject to local zoning restrictions or liberalization of restrictions). As part of this expansion, KAYS ceased operations of its Portland grow facility at the end of March 2017, arranged to maintain its genetics library of over 30 strains of cannabis at an OHA licensed medical grow site and contracted with farmers to meet demand until the new facility is secured, built and fully operational.

Kaya Buddie™ Strain Specific Cannabis Cigarettes
 

In 2016 the Company introduced a signature line of strain-specific connoisseur-grade, pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes branded as “Kaya Buddies™”. The brand, marketed under the tagline “Buds with Benefits”, features over 25 different strains of connoisseur-grade, high quality cannabis and proprietary specialty blends. The Kaya Buddies™ cannabis cigarettes, made from 100% cannabis bud only, was launched in mid-March in the Kaya Shack™ stores in Oregon and are targeted to service the exploding legal recreational marijuana market.

42

Kaya Buddies™ cannabis cigarettes have consistently been very well received by both older medical patients and recreational users new to cannabis. Although they are first being marketed through our internal retail network they are also being targeted for potential distribution lines to other dispensaries.

Other Potential Markets
 
We believe that revenues and profitability will be enhanced through our planned opening of additional retail outlets utilizing the Kaya Shack™ brand and model in our chain, as well as economies of scale achieved by being a multi-location retail chain and being vertically integrated with grow and manufacturing operations. Ultimately, we believe that we can successfully enter other markets as they open up by applying our “brand” retail chain and vertically integrated grow and manufacture model to other states that legalize recreational marijuana use. Where applicable, we will seek to leverage our public company status to finance organic growth and enable acquisitions of existing locations for the Kaya Shack brand, as well as look to acquire and grow additional brands.
 
On November 8, 2016, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada voted to legalize recreational marijuana, while Arkansas, Florida and North Dakota approved medical cannabis initiatives. Montana, which legalized medical marijuana in 2004, also passed a measure to set up commercial cultivation operations and dispensaries.
 
The California recreational cannabis market is by far the largest potential market in the country, and our operations in Oregon allow for a natural progression and expansion down the I-5 corridor into California. Florida could be a potentially large market for us as well, because we believe that KAYS would have a distinct advantage in the state, as it is one of the few Florida-based entities whose management has significant experience in owning and operating MMDs and grow and manufacturing operations. These markets are substantial, and their development could lead to $7-$8 billion in additional annual retail cannabis sales, according to Marijuana Business Daily’s preliminary estimates.
 




Growth Strategy
 
The Company has established a well-defined strategy for entering and maintaining a strong presence in the legal marijuana sector. The cornerstones of this strategy include:
 

• | All operations are to be conducted in accordance with state and local laws and regulations and guidance outlined in the U.S. Department of Justice “Cole Memo” dated August 29, 2013.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company will seek to operate in a vertically integrated manner (grow, process and sell) wherever permitted by law. In states where vertical integration is not permitted, the Company plans to determine which of the permitted activities offers the most potential for growth and value creation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company will seek to engage, sponsor or lead local advocacy and lobbying groups that have a significant impact on the evolution and character of laws and the regulations under which legal marijuana operations are implemented in select markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Company shall work with law enforcement and government officials to insure compliance with all regulations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


44
--

Marketing and Sales
 
The Company will only market its legal marijuana as in compliance with applicable state law.
 
The Company employs a marketing campaign consisting of four cornerstones:
 

• | Promoting and establishing the Kaya Shack™ brand.
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | A positive and active online presence.
--+---------------------------------------


• | Daily specials and promotions.
--+-------------------------------


• | Quirky and fun holiday specials.
--+---------------------------------

 
Our core strategic marketing objectives include:
 

• | Establish the Kaya Shack™ Brand – positioning the Company’s brand to have positive and value related associations with all prospective and existing customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operate Cooperatively - cooperation, as a strategy, helps develop a network of suppliers and marketing channels able to promote Kaya Shack™.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deliver Value - customer value is achieved when the perceived value of what we sell along with the value of the experience we deliver exceeds the price we charge.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive Customer Traffic - the only two ways to increase store income is to sell more to our existing customers and attract new customers. Programs are in place to accomplish both tasks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws directly applicable to our operations. As we continue to expand the scope of our operations, the application of existing laws and regulations could include matters such as pricing, advertising, consumer protection, quality of products, and intellectual property ownership. In addition, we will also be subject to new laws and regulations directly applicable to our activities.
 
Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, which could hinder or prevent the growth of our business.
 
Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing legal recreational and medical marijuana use are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance. In addition, violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our planned business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that additional or revised federal, state and local laws and regulations may be enacted in the future governing the legal marijuana industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with any such laws and regulations and its failure to do so could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 

45
--

Competition
 
The legal marijuana sector is rapidly growing and the Company faces significant competition in the operation of retail outlets, MMDs and grow facilities. Many of these competitors will have far greater experience, more extensive industry contacts and greater financial resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that we can adequately compete to succeed in our business plan.
Employees
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, our Oregon operations have a total of seventeen (17) part-time store employees including budtenders, trimmers, growers, and 4 full-time employees- a Store Manager, a Sales and Marketing Coordinator, the Director of Dispensary and Grow Operations and a Master Grower. Additionally, we engage several consultants to assist with daily duties and business plan implementation and execution. Additional employees will be hired and other consultants engaged in the future as our business expands.
