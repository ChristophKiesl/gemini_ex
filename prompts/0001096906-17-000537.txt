Development of Scanner Technology Business
 
Defense Technologies International Corp. (the “Company”) plans to bring defense detection and protection products to market intended to improve security for military personnel, schools and other public facilities.
 
Effective July 15, 2016, the Company executed documents intended to finalize the acquisition of 100% of Defense Technology Corporation, a privately held Colorado company (“DTC”), a developer of defense, detection and protection products to improve security for Anchor schools and other public facilities.  Subsequently, the Company and DTC mutually agreed to rescind the acquisition of DTC and entered into a Rescission Agreement and Mutual Release (the “Rescission Agreement”), dated October 17, 2016.
 
In connection with the Rescission Agreement with the Company, DTC rescinded its agreement with the inventor and developer of the technology and assets that were subject to the original agreement between the Company and DTC.  On October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a new Definitive Agreement with Controlled Capture Systems, LLC (“CCS”), representing the inventor of the technology and assets previously acquired by DTC, that included a new exclusive Patent License Agreement and Independent Contractor agreement.  Under the license agreement with CCS, the Company acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products and improvements.  The term of the License Agreement shall be from October 19, 2016 until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed issued patents or patents to be issued.
 
The Company agreed to pay CCS an initial licensing fee of $25,000 and to pay ongoing royalties at the end of each six-month period at the rate of the greater of 5% of gross sales used or sold, or the minimum royalty payment of $25,000.  The Company also agreed to compensate investors that have provided funding for the development of CCS’s technology with 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.  Additionally, CCS will be entitled to receive 250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock upon completed sales of 1,000 passive scanner units based on the CCS technology.
 
The Independent Contractor Agreement between the Company and CCS provides that CCS will provide support for the development of the security technology and products.  An initial payment of $5,000 was paid to CCS plus ongoing hourly compensation for services provided.
 
The Company capitalized the costs to acquire the License Agreement, including the $25,000 initial licensing fee and the estimated value of $353,600 of the 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock issued on November 10, 2016 to the CCS investors, which value was based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the Definitive Agreement. The Company has recorded a current liability of $25,000 for the remaining obligation in its consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2017.  Once sales of products based on the CCS technology begin, the Company will amortize the capitalized costs over the estimated life of the license agreement as determined by the legal life of patents issued.
 
Effective January 12, 2017, Passive Security Scan, Inc. (“PSSI”) was incorporated in the state of Utah as a wholly owned subsidiary.  The Company merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Long Canyon Gold Resources Corp. (“Long Canyon”), into PSSI, with PSSI the surviving entity.  The Company transferred to PSSI its exclusive world-wide license to the defense, detection and protection security products previously acquired by the Company.  The Company currently owns 65.38% of PSSI with 34.62% acquired by several individuals and entities.  With the merger of Long Canyon into PSSI, the Company discontinued its mineral exploration business.  The Company plans to continue the development of the technology and conduct all sales and marketing activities in PSSI.

The security products licensed from CCS and to be developed by the Company are designed for personal and collateral protection.  The proposed detection technology is intended to provide passive security scanning units for either walk-through or hand-held use to improve security for schools and other public facilities.  The units use electromagnets and do not emit anything (such as x-rays) through the subject.  The Company, in consultation with CCS, recently completed a prototype with optional “Digital Imaging” which will give the user of the scanner the ability to recall the entire traffic passing through the scanner at any time thereafter.  The prototype scanner unit has successfully passed lab testing and is ready for deployment and demonstration.
 
Competition
 
We believe we have the only known passive scanner technology based on earth magnetic technology that does not cause any harm to the subject passing through the scanner.  Our scanners are therefore uniquely suited for school systems and other public venues.  Our competitors’ technology is based on X-Ray, microwave or radio signals, all of which are harmful over time.  We believe this provides an advantage to our scanners over those developed by our competition.
Sales and Marketing
 
Through a contract representative, we have made contact with several schools that have expressed interest in having the Passive Security Scan Unit presented at the school for demonstration and evaluation.  Furthermore, as funding permits, we plan to install a demonstration unit in every state free of charge via the state’s Governor’s Office. We expect major exposure through this program.
 
We will also plan to announce the availability of distributorships.  A distributor will get a 20% discount on Gross Sales, but is required to purchase a minimum of 25 units at time of signing for a distributorship.  General referrals will earn a 10% discount.
 

With the completion of requisite funding, we expect to place the first units during September 2017 and commence a major marketing campaign at the same time.  We believe that we will start production and sales within the coming three months.
 
With the start of initial sales, we believe that we will be able to raise major funding through more conventional sources for our production.
 
Trademarks and Copyrights
 
We acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products and improvements.  The term of the License Agreement shall be from October 19, 2016 until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed issued patents or patents to be issued.  CCS currently owns 3 patents and 2 patents pending related to the technology.
Employees
 
We presently do not have any employees and do not anticipate adding employees until our business operations and financial resources so warrant. The Independent Contractor Agreement between the Company and CCS provides that CCS will provide support for the development of the security technology and products.  The management of our Company is provided through a series of service agreements with our officers and directors and key consultants.
Facilities
 

We presently rent office facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada that serve as our principal executive offices.  The facilities are rented on a month-to-month basis on terms of $497 per month.  Additional office space is subleased from EMAC, a related party, in North Vancouver BC, Canada on a month-to-month basis at $250 per month.
