ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on December 19, 2014 in the State of Nevada.
 
Overview
 
The Company is focused on providing real and valuable digital traffic to our customers’ ecommerce sites, and now with the Sharerails acquisition, to their actual retail locations. Our initial efforts were to detect digital marketing fraud for our customers. Sharerails expands our focus from just preventing fraud, to actually providing clean, high value marketing traffic to our customers from known good sources. We had revenues of $162,750 in the year ended December 31, 2016. On March 31, 2017, we acquired ShareRails, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“ShareRails”). ShareRails is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
ShareRails provides its customers with a unique, interactive mobile platform for connecting shoppers and retailers. ShareRails has been operated by its two founders who will continue to work with us and ShareRails to service their existing enterprise clients and expand our customer base. We believe that together we will be able to further expand our reach into the social commerce and retail marketing industry.

The Market
 
Fraudulent digital traffic continues to plague traditional digital advertising methods. In addition, conventional brick and mortar retailers, much less affected by digital fraud, are simply being out competed by e-commerce heavyweights like Amazon and Alibaba. Fundamentally both e-commerce sites and retailers need one thing: real consumers buying their products. With the acquisition of Sharerails Grey Cloak has expanded its efforts from just preventing digital fraud to actually generating known good traffic to brick and mortar retailers and their ecommerce sites.
 
While large retailers like Sears, and Macy’s have been under considerable pressure, the evidence is that retail is, on a worldwide basis, re-inventing itself. Innovative retailers are changing their business models to accommodate new trends in consumer behavior away from commodity products and towards more customized, and high touch products and services. Malls for example, which are the main customers for the Sharerails products, are moving toward a more experiential environment with some of newer malls featuring art, music, and healthcare. Other malls are focusing on high end dining and entertainment. The retailers that are thriving in those environments focus on products and services which consumers typically need to see face to face before purchasing. Making retail more experiential we believe is a mega trend in retail, and will culminate in richer, more compelling physical shopping and related experiences.
 
Research indicates that mobile computing, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and other technologies will drive changes in consumer behavior and the retail experience. It is Grey Cloaks plan to integrate technologies from companies like Sharerails into offerings that help retailers, malls (and other retail ‘aggregators’), use new technologies to drive actual sales.
 
Our intial product offering from Sharerails include the Sharerails cloud base platform and 3 add on services:
 
The Sharerails Local Inventory Service enables malls and their retailers to put their entire local inventory online. This creates an immediate digital presence which a normal mall website simply lacks.
 
The Sharerails Social Media add-on allows malls and retailers to create a turnkey social media experience around their products and location.
 
The Sharerails Concierge Service allows individuals at a retailer or a mall or other retail aggregator, to provide one to one mobile communications between sales and service personal and individual consumers. We believe this product will help drive the change in retail toward higher touch, personalized services and products.
 
At the moment the Company has a large luxury Mall in Hong Kong using the product as well as a mall here in the US. Both customers have options on more of their mall properties. The products can all be localized to specific languages and have clean mobile, tablet, and full screen interfaces. The Company generally sells the Local Inventory Service with the base and then endeavors to upsell the other two products which take advantage of our knowledge of the retailers’ local inventory.

Our Mission
 
Our mission is to provide meaningful electronic and foot traffic to brick and mortar retailers and their ecommerce sites and participate in the ongoing retooling of retail on a worldwide basis.
Anticipated Products
 
We believe that the Sharerails platform is a good base to use to become a premier provider of mobile and advanced technology to retailers worldwide.
 
The Company sees a lot of opportunity in these areas moving forward:
 

· | Incorporation of AI in ‘good bot’ technology that allows retailers to participate in meaningful interactions with consumers using Facebook messenger and like platforms. We believe that the integration of bot technology with products like the Sharerails Concierge product described above, will be more compelling than custom mobile apps for the majority of consumers that favor text apps for communication.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Integration of the Sharerails platform with Amazon’s Alexa, and like products will provide a future path for a more sophisticated interaction between brick and mortar retailers and consumers both in the home and in the mall and store
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Influencer marketing which leverages social media to provide traffic rather than traditional digital marketing is becoming a much bigger part of the overall digital marketing story, and we believe that the Sharerails social media platform, currently in use by Marie Claire, Australia can be a big part of that story.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our product offerings are sold on a subscription basis, where price varies based on the size of the retailer or mall and the features of our product suite that they choose. Approximately we would expect revenues on a per customer basis (mall or retailer) to be:
 

· | Small retailers: $500-$1,000 per month
--+---------------------------------------


· | Medium size retailers and small retail aggregators (strip malls, airports, etc.) $2,500-$5,000 per month
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Large retailers, large malls, or aggregators: $5,000-$40,000 per month
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently we are generating $25,000/month in recurring subscription revenue or services.

Accessing Our Technology
 
Our software applications run in the Amazon cloud. The overall system runs over redundant MySql or SQL server databases using the Amazon SAN for storage of the data. MySql and SQL Server are both relational database management systems (RDBMS). MySql is the most widely used open-source (RDBMS) enabling the delivery of reliable, high performance and scalable web based applications, while SQL Server offers features useful for several of the Sharerails products The Company also uses several of the Amazon cloud services including search and the data storage facility S3. Our use of Amazon computing services is based on a month to month agreement. Amazon has data centers in the U.S., Ireland, Brazil, Singapore, and Tokyo. All of our services can run in any of the data centers at any time based upon demand. This allows for scalability to very large numbers of concurrent users and clicks.
Sales and Marketing
 
We aspire to be a provider of “quality of visitor” information to businesses who use the internet world wide. Our first year efforts will be focused on deploying the software platform to key high end malls worldwide. We have a substantial contact network that we can use to get into most major commercial retail property owners in the US, Asia, and Europe.
Patents and Intellectual Property Rights
 
We have not filed for any intellectual property protection, however we believe we will be able to file several patents in the retail digital marketing space as our efforts expand to include AI and other leading edge technologies.
 
In addition to the patents we are considering, we use intellectual property law that may include a combination of copyright, trade secret and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our employees and independent contractors will be required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent intellectual property that we own. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business.
 
From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. While we believe that our product and service offerings do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party, we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any intellectual property dispute. If we do not prevail in such disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of the applications determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial royalties to a third party.
 
Governmental Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements
 
We are not currently subject to direct federal, state or local regulation other than the requirement to have a business license for the areas in which we conduct business. We do not anticipate being a governmental contractor. We may be, however, subject to United States export control restrictions.

Competition
 
We do not believe that there are competitors that substantially have our vision. Several companies are working on local search for malls and retailers, but they lack the long term vision which includes social media, one to one services, etc. We believe this will change as we succeed, but at the moment we do not see any other companies with our comprehensive offering. The above said, competition exists for each piece of our overall solution and we would expect such competition to broaden their offerings to become more competitive against our integrated product offering.
Employees
 
As of the date hereof, we do not have any employees other than our officers and directors and one employee. Our officers and directors will continue to work for us for the foreseeable future. We anticipate hiring appropriate personnel on an as-needed basis, and utilizing the services of independent contractors as needed.
