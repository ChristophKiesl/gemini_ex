Overview
9 Meters is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare and unmet needs in gastroenterology. Our pipeline includes drug candidates for short bowel syndrome (SBS), celiac disease, and three early-stage candidates for undisclosed rare diseases and/or unmet needs, two of which are expected to be IND-enabling during 2021.
In April 2020, we completed a merger (the “RDD Merger”) with privately-held RDD Pharma, Ltd., an Israel corporation (“RDD”) and changed our name from Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. to 9 Meters Biopharma, Inc. Shortly thereafter, we acquired Naia Rare Diseases, Inc. and completed the integration of all three entities during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Our current product development pipeline is described in the table below. 
Figure 1: Current product development pipeline
Corporate Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on rare and unmet needs in gastroenterology that have the potential to transform current treatment paradigms for patients and to address unmet medical needs. The critical components of our strategy are as follows:
•Advance the development of NM-002 for the treatment of SBS. We recently completed the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for the treatment of SBS. We announced positive topline results in December 2020, indicating that NM-002 met its primary objective, demonstrating excellent safety and tolerability. In addition, NM-002 demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement in TSO volume within 48 hours of first dose. Following communication from the FDA during the first quarter of 2021, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial in the second quarter of 2021. Topline results are currently expected in the fourth quarter of 2021.
•Complete the Phase 3 clinical trial for NM-001 (larazotide) for celiac disease. We initiated the Phase 3 trial for larazotide for treatment of celiac disease during 2019. We have approximately 110 active clinical trial sites with three treatment groups, 0.25 mg of larazotide, 0.5 mg of larazotide and a placebo arm. After consultation with the FDA, the analytical approach to the primary endpoint was modified to perform a continuous variable analysis instead of a responder analysis of the primary efficacy outcome. The new methodology enables a more capital 
efficient study, with reduction in participants from 630 to 525. Site activation and patient enrollment have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the evolving situation with COVID-19, which could continue to directly or indirectly impact the pace of enrollment. Given challenges in enrollment related to the COVID-19 pandemic, interim results and topline data readouts are now anticipated in 2022.
•Advance our early-stage drug product candidates for undisclosed rare and unmet needs. We plan to initiate IND-enabling studies for NM-003, our long-acting GLP-2 agonist, and NM-102, our proprietary tight-junction microbiome modulator.
•Acquire targeted clinical compounds for rare and unmet needs in GI diseases. We continually evaluate in-licensing opportunities and may acquire targeted clinical compounds for rare and unmet needs in GI disease. Focusing on rare and unmet needs within GI allows for a targeted corporate development approach. 
•Commercialization strategy. For products with rare and/or orphan patient populations, our plan is to build an infrastructure to commercialize our drug products within the U.S and target key prescribing physicians, including specialists such as gastroenterologists, as well as provide patients with support programs to ensure product access. In addition, we will seek partners to commercialize our drug products outside of the U.S. For large addressable markets, such as celiac disease, we plan to seek out partners with an established presence and history of successful commercialization. 
•Leverage, protect and enhance our intellectual property portfolio and secure patents for additional indications. We intend to continue to expand our intellectual property, grounded in securing composition of matter patents and method of use patents for new indications. We plan to develop new formulations for our current product candidates for other indications and improve performance of existing product candidates. We plan to enhance the intellectual property portfolio further through learning from ongoing clinical trials and manufacturing processes.
•Outsource capital intensive operations. We plan to continue to outsource capital intensive operations, including most clinical development and all manufacturing operations of our product candidates and to facilitate the rapid development of our pipeline by using high quality specialist vendors and consultants in a capital efficient manner.

Agreement with the European Biomedical Research Institute of Salerno
On December 21, 2020, we entered into a material transfer agreement (“MTA”) with the European Biomedical Research Institute of Salerno (“EBRIS”) in Italy to advance a study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of larazotide when delivered to lung tissue in healthy volunteers. The Company and EBRIS agreed that we would supply drug sufficient to initiate and complete a Phase 1 study in Australia during 2021 to assess the safety and tolerability of the drug when delivered directly to 
the lungs. EBRIS agreed to manage the operations and financing of the study. Based on the results of the Phase 1 study, EBRIS may advance into a phase 2/3 program in COVID-19 patients, at which point the terms of a new agreement would be determined.
NM-002 for the Treatment of Short Bowel Syndrome
NM-002, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) receptor agonist that combines exenatide with a proprietary extended half-life technology for treatment of SBS. SBS is a debilitating orphan disease with an underserved market. It affects up to 20,000 adults in the U.S., with similar prevalence in Europe. Patients with SBS cannot absorb enough water, vitamins, protein, fat, calories and other nutrients from food. It is a severe disease with life changing consequences, such as impaired intestinal absorption, diarrhea and metabolic complications. A portion of the patient population have a life-long dependency on Parenteral Support (PS) to survive with risk of life-threatening infections and extra-organ impairment. NM-002 links exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue, to a long-acting linker technology and is designed specifically to address the gastric effects in SBS patients by slowing digestive transit time. The asset uses proprietary XTEN® technology to extend the half-life of exenatide, allowing for once-to twice-per-month dosing, thus potentially increasing convenience for patients and caregivers. 
Figure 3: Short bowel syndrome disease profile
NM-002 has demonstrated efficacy and an extended half-life up to 30 days in a 70-patient clinical study and received orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. We dosed our first patients in a Phase 1b/2a study in adult patients suffering from SBS in July 2020, with the goal of developing a safer, more efficacious and convenient therapy. 
Figure 4: NM-002 Mechanism of Action
Figure 5: NM-002 Target Product Profile
On December 7, 2020, we announced positive topline results from our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for NM-002 in SBS. The study met its primary objective as NM-002 demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability. In addition, NM-002 demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement in total stool output (TSO) volume within 48 hours of first dose. 
The Phase 1b/2a clinical trial was an open-label, two-dose study evaluating the safety and tolerability of three escalating fixed doses of NM-002 (50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg) in 9 adults with SBS for 56 days. The trial was conducted at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Patients in each of three cohorts received two subcutaneous doses two weeks apart with six weeks of subsequent follow-up. The study assessed the safety and tolerability of repeated doses on Days 1 and 15 at each dose level. Because reduced TSO volume and bowel movement frequency are correlated with improved intestinal absorption and potentially less need for intravenous supplementation for nutrition and hydration, these were key secondary objectives in the trial. The primary purpose of this open-label Phase 1b/2a study was to learn about the compound and its safety and potential efficacy in order to inform future development. The study protocol called for an analysis of urine output, however, it proved difficult to measure in an ambulatory setting and therefore the analysis is not expected to be meaningful.
NM-002 was generally safe and well tolerated: 17 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 9 patients, 15 of which were mild, transient and self-limited without further intervention. The majority of TEAEs were GI-related (nausea and vomiting).
Importantly, 8 of the 9 patients experienced meaningful declines in TSO following each dose, relative to a baseline output. The rapid onset of clinical improvements in stool volumes, as observed in all 9 patients having substantial reductions in stool output within 48 hours of the first dose, shows the potential for NM-002 to address the primary problem of chronic malabsorptive diarrhea in SBS patients. Additionally, four of seven patients showed reductions in bowel movement frequency after and one dose and five of six evaluable patients showed reductions in bowel movement frequency after the second dose. Furthermore, of the five patients on parenteral support in the study, two patients showed reduction in PS after each dose. Results of the short form health survey quality of life instrument show directional improvement in multiple elements of health status over the course of the study. The short form health survey, or SF-36, is a set of generic, coherent and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting and are now widely utilized by managed care organizations and by Medicare for routine monitoring and assessment of care outcomes in adult patients. 
Figure 6: NM-002 Phase 1b/2a trial results 
Following FDA communication in the first quarter of 2021, we plan to initiate a phase 2 study of NM-002 for the treatment of SBS in the second quarter of 2021 in approximately 22 patients using TSO as the primary efficacy outcome measure. This trial is planned to be a multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized placebo-controlled trial. The FDA has provided global anchor questions and specific guidance for performance of exit interviews to support clinical meaningfulness of observed efficacy.

NM-001 (Larazotide) for Celiac Disease

Larazotide is being developed for the treatment of celiac disease and has successfully completed a Phase 2b trial showing statistically significant reduction in abdominal and non-GI (headache) symptoms. Larazotide is an 8-amino acid peptide formulated into an orally administered capsule and has been tested in nearly 600 celiac patients with statistically significant improvement in celiac symptoms. The FDA has granted larazotide Fast Track Designation for celiac disease. Larazotide’s safety profile has been similar to placebo. In addition, the FDA granted a thorough QT (TQT) study waiver. The waiver supports larazotide’s strong precedent of safety and could potentially streamline the program’s timeline and cost effectiveness. Additionally, larazotide’s mechanism of action as a tight junction regulator is a new approach to treating autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease. Multiple pre-clinical studies have shown larazotide causes a reduction in permeability across the intestinal epithelial barrier, making it the only drug candidate known to us which is in clinical trials with this mechanism of action. 

With the release of the Phase 2b trial data in 342 celiac patients at the 2014 Digestive Disease Week conference, larazotide became the first and the only drug for the treatment of celiac disease (published data), which met its primary efficacy endpoint with statistical significance. The Phase 2b data showed statistically significant (p=0.022) reduction in abdominal and non-GI (headache) symptoms as measured by the patient reported outcome primary end point for celiac disease created specifically for celiac disease and wholly owned by us (“CeD PRO”). After a successful End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, which confirmed the regulatory path forward, we launched the Phase 3 registration program in 2019 and dosed the first patient in August 2019. 
Figure 8: Responder Rate Analysis: Larazotide is the only drug in development for celiac disease to meet its primary endpoint with statistical significance (shown above) as measured by CeD GSRS and the copyrighted CeD PRO. Source: Gastroenterology 2015; 148:1311–1319; p. 1315
Larazotide has the potential to be a first-to-market therapeutic for celiac disease, an unmet medical need affecting an estimated 1% of the U.S. population or more than 3 million individuals. Patients with celiac disease have no treatment alternative other than a strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet, which is difficult to maintain and can be deficient in key nutrients. In celiac disease, larazotide is the only drug which has successfully met its primary clinical efficacy endpoint with statistical significance in a Phase 2b efficacy trial, which was comprised of 342 patients. We completed the End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for the treatment of celiac disease with larazotide and received Fast Track designation. Larazotide has been shown to be safe and effective after being tested in several clinical trials involving nearly 600 patients, most recently in the Phase 2b trial for celiac disease.
We have approximately 110 active clinical trial sites in our Phase 3 trial with three treatment groups, 0.25 mg of larazotide, 0.5 mg of larazotide and a placebo arm. Site activation and patient enrollment have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the evolving situation with COVID-19, which is likely to directly or indirectly impact the pace of enrollment over the next several months. In addition, after consultation with the FDA, the analytical approach to the primary endpoint was modified to perform a continuous variable analysis instead of a responder analysis of the primary efficacy outcome. The new methodology enables a more capital-efficient study, with reduction in participants from 630 to 525. 
Given challenges in enrollment related to the COVID-19 pandemic, interim results and topline data readouts are now anticipated in 2022. Recently, we engaged Beyond Celiac to identify potential and appropriate patients for enrollment in the Phase 3 trial. We are planning to implement multiple additional measures to potentially enhance enrollment. We do not expect these measures to be implemented until COVID-19 restrictions are significantly lifted. 
Larazotide is being investigated as an adjunct to a gluten-free diet for celiac patients who continue to experience symptoms despite adhering to a gluten-free diet. Due to the difficulty of maintaining a gluten-free diet due to lack of easy access to and the higher cost of gluten-free foods, cross contamination from gluten as well as inadvertent exposure. It is estimated that more than half the celiac population experiences multiple, potentially debilitating, symptoms per month. A study from the UK indicates that more than 70% of patients diagnosed with celiac disease consume gluten either intentionally or inadvertently (Hall et al. 2013). 
Larazotide is an orally administered, locally acting, non-systemic, synthetic 8-amino acid, tight junction regulator being investigated as an adjunct to a gluten-free diet in celiac disease patients who still experience persistent GI symptoms despite 
being on a gluten-free diet. Because of larazotide’s lack of absorption into the blood circulation, we believe that fewer complications, if any, are likely to develop for individuals taking chronically dosed lifetime medication.

The larazotide drug product is an enteric coated drug product formulated as enteric coated multiparticulate beads filled into hard gelatin capsules for oral delivery. The enteric coating is designed to allow the bead particles to bypass the stomach and release larazotide upon entry into the small intestine (duodenum). A mixed bead formulation is used to allow partial release of larazotide upon entry into the duodenum and to release the remaining larazotide approximately 30 minutes later. In clinical trials, larazotide has been dosed 15 minutes before meals allowing time for its effect in the small bowel before exposure to gluten.
 
In research studies supportive of the mechanism of action, larazotide has been shown to stimulate recovery of mucosal barrier function via the regulation of tight junctions both in vitro and in vivo, including in a celiac disease mouse model (Gopalakrishnan, 2012). In doing so, it is proposed that larazotide reduces the symptoms associated with celiac disease.

Figure 9: Larazotide intestinal barrier response
In several autoimmune diseases, this increased intestinal permeability or paracellular leakage allows increased exposure to a triggering antigen and a consequent inflammatory response, the characteristics of which are determined by the particular disease and the genetic makeup of the individual. A new paradigm for autoimmune diseases is that there are three contributing factors to the development of disease:
1.A genetically susceptible immune system that allows the host to react abnormally to an environmental antigen;
2.An environmental antigen that triggers the disease process; and
3.The ability of the environmental antigen to interact with the immune system.

Larazotide regulates tight junction opening triggered by both gluten and inflammatory cytokines, thus reducing uptake of gluten. Larazotide also disrupts the intestinal permeability-inflammation loop and has been shown to reduce symptoms associated with celiac disease.

Larazotide’s Dose Response

Previously published in vitro work using Caco-2 cells has shown a linear dose response for larazotide in reducing permeability of the epithelial barrier by tightening the leaky tight junctions (Gopalakrishnan, 2012). In several clinical trials, larazotide has exhibited clinical benefit by reducing celiac symptoms at lower doses while inhibition of this activity occurs at the higher doses. To better understand this observation, Dr. Anthony Blikslager from North Carolina State University evaluated the pharmacology of larazotide at the luminal surface of the small intestine in an ex vivo porcine model. A section of the porcine intestine was ligated, placed in an Ussing chamber while changes in permeability were measured by electrical resistance. Multiple experiments demonstrated that following an ischemic insult causing increased intestinal permeability, 
full length larazotide is capable of restoring intestinal wall integrity to that of the non-ischemic control. Subsequently, it was discovered that a specific aminopeptidase located within the brush borders of the intestinal epithelium cleaves larazotide into two fragments which lack either one or both N-terminus glycine (G) residues (GG VLVQPG). Both cleaved fragments, GVLVQPG and VLVQPG, do not decrease intestinal permeability. Moreover, when these two fragments are administered in combination with the active full-length larazotide, they inhibit larazotide’s activity to restore intestinal wall integrity or reduce permeability. These data demonstrate that higher doses of larazotide lead to local buildup of breakdown fragments, which then compete with and block activity of larazotide after threshold concentration is reached. The in vitro experiments using Caco-2 monolayers did not show the same pharmacology and dose response because they lack the brush border and therefore lack the aminopeptidase which cleaves larazotide. These data also provide an explanation for the clinical observations of an optimal lower dose of larazotide, which avoids the reservoir of competing inactive fragments generated at high doses of larazotide.


Figure 10: An aminopeptidase in the brush border cleaves larazotide into two fragments; fragment #2 acts as an inhibitor of larazotide

As we further instigate larazotide’s dose response, we are also exploring larazotide analogs and derivatives by which we may be able to offer a longer acting molecule with a traditional dose response to improve efficacy. A molecule that would be resistant to proteolytic degradation. We continue to work with our academic collaborators to further investigate. 
Summary of Key Clinical Trials using Larazotide in Celiac Disease

Larazotide has been administered to humans in seven clinical trials. These include three Phase 1 trials: (two trials in healthy subjects and a Phase 1b proof of concept (POC) trial in subjects with celiac disease), two Phase 2 gluten challenge studies in subjects with controlled celiac disease and additionally two Phase 2 trials in subjects with active celiac disease (Figure 11). After the Phase 1 studies, larazotide was tested to explore which endpoint would be suitable for celiac disease. After looking at permeability changes in the gut, which turned out to be highly variable in a large trial setting and then mucosal healing, which likely requires a longer-term study, symptom reduction showed the most consistent and reliable reduction both in a gluten challenge and a ‘‘real-life’’ trial. Importantly, after exposure in nearly 600 subjects, the safety profile of larazotide remained similar to placebo due to its lack of absorption into the bloodstream, which we believe is an important advantage for a chronically dosed drug.

The initial Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for the treatment of celiac disease was filed with the FDA by Alba Therapeutics Corporation (Alba) on 12 August 2005 for the use of larazotide acetate (NM-001). The IND was transferred from Alba to Innovate effective March 8, 2016. During the course of the seven clinical studies, 5 patients experienced a serious adverse event, of which 2 received placebo and 3 received larazotide. These events included inflammation of the gallbladder, gall stones, depression, allergic reaction to penicillin and appendicitis. We do not believe that any of these events were considered related to treatment with study medication.

Clinical Trial (‘006) Results Revealed Key Insight into Symptom Reduction as a Primary Endpoint

A Phase 2b study with a gluten challenge (CLIN1001-006) was conducted in 184 subjects with well-controlled celiac disease on a gluten-free diet. Subjects were randomized to one of four treatment groups, (placebo, 1 mg, 4 mg, or 8 mg larazotide) and asked to take treatment 15 minutes prior to each meal (TID). Subjects remained on their gluten-free diets throughout the duration of the trial except for nine hundred (900) mg of gluten that was taken with each meal. The trial results revealed key insights into how to move the program forward by focusing on reduction of symptoms. The 1-mg dose prevented the development of gluten-induced symptoms as measured by CeD GSRS (a patient-reported outcome (PRO) devised and validated by AstraZeneca) and all drug treatment groups had lower anti-transglutaminase antibody levels than the placebo group. Results of pre-specified secondary endpoints suggest that larazotide reduced antigen exposure as manifested by reduced production of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) levels and immune reactivity towards gluten and gluten-related GI symptoms in subjects with celiac disease undergoing a gluten challenge.

Clinical Trial (‘012) Met the Primary Endpoint with Statistical Significance (CeD GSRS/CeD PRO)

The purpose of the ‘012 study was to assess the efficacy (reduction and relief of signs and symptoms of celiac disease) of 3 different doses of larazotide (0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg TID) versus placebo for the treatment of celiac disease in adults as an adjunct to a gluten-free diet. Larazotide or placebo was administered TID, 15 minutes prior to each meal. After a screening period, subjects were asked to continue following their current gluten-free diets into a placebo run-in phase for 4 weeks after which they were randomized to drug versus placebo. Subjects maintained an electronic diary capturing daily symptoms (CeD-PRO), weekly symptoms (CeD GSRS), bowel movements (BSFS) and a self-reported daily general well-being assessment.
The primary endpoint of average on-treatment CeD GSRS score throughout the treatment period was met at the 0.5 mg tid dose. In addition, a number of pre-specified secondary and exploratory endpoints, such as symptomatic days and symptom-free days, collectively demonstrated that a dose of 0.5 mg tid was superior to placebo and higher doses of larazotide. No difference was observed between the two higher dose levels (1 mg and 2 mg TID) or placebo, suggesting a narrow dose range around the 0.5 mg dose, which also seems to correlate with pre-clinical data.

The CeD PRO showed a statically significant (p=0.022) treatment effect of 14.3% (drug responder rate minus placebo responder rate). Although to our knowledge there are no celiac drugs approved as a comparator, the treatment effect was greater than several other GI dugs approved for IBS and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) which use a similar clinical trial design.
Figure 12: Phase 3 trial design for the treatment of celiac disease
The Phase 3 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of larazotide acetate for the relief of persistent symptoms in patients with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet, or GFD. The trial consists of a screening/eligibility period, a 12-week double-blind treatment phase and a 12-week double-blind safety phase. The primary outcome measures the reduction in CeD-PRO Abdominal Domain scores over the 12-week double-blind treatment phase. Key inclusion criteria include adult patients diagnosed with celiac disease (positive celiac serology plus confirmed biopsy) for at least 6 months, on a GFD for at least 6 months, experiencing symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, abdominal cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhea, loose stools or nausea) and those willing to maintain current GFD throughout the participation of the study. Those patients screened with refractory celiac or severe complications of celiac disease and/or chronic active GI disease other than celiac are excluded from the study.
CeD PRO: Copyrighted Primary Endpoint for Celiac Disease Tested in a Successful Clinical Trial

The CeD PRO was developed based on FDA guidance and is copyrighted in the United States effective October 13, 2011. The copyright registration is in effect for 95 years from the year of first publication or 120 years from the year of creation, whichever expires first. If larazotide is approved by the FDA and is the first drug to be approved for celiac disease, we believe that the PRO will become the standard for assessing efficacy in celiac disease. Competitor companies seeking to use a PRO to establish efficacy in this indication would either need to develop their own PRO or would be required to license the CeD PRO from us, thus providing an additional barrier to competitor entry into the marketplace. 
About Celiac Disease

Celiac disease is a genetic autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten-containing foods such as wheat, barley and rye. Individuals with celiac disease have increased intestinal permeability, commonly referred to as ‘‘leaky’’ gut. This allows macromolecules that normally remain on the luminal side of the intestine to pass through to the serosal side through tight junctions via paracellular diffusion. In the case of celiac disease, this permeability may allow gluten break-down products, the triggering antigens of celiac disease, to reach gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), initiating an inflammatory response. Celiac disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa that may result in diverse symptoms, malabsorption, atrophy of intestinal villi and a variety of clinical manifestations.

Large Population — Unmet Need (no drug approved); Serious Long-Term Consequences

Celiac disease affects an estimated 1% of the Western population (Dubé, 2005). Currently, there are no therapeutics available to treat celiac disease and the current management of celiac disease is a life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet. Changes in dietary habits are difficult to maintain and foods labeled as gluten-free may still contain small amounts of gluten (up to 20 ppm per FDA labeling standards). Dietary compliance is imperfect in a large fraction of patients (Rostom, 2006) and difficult to adhere to on an ongoing basis (Green, 2007). In a survey conducted in the United Kingdom non-adherence to the gluten-free diet was found to be as high as 70% (Hall, 2013).

There are serious long-term consequences to exposure to gluten in patients with celiac disease, including the risk of developing osteoporosis, stomach, esophageal, or colon cancers and T-cell lymphoma (Green 2003, Green 2007). The continuous GI symptoms often result in significant morbidity with a substantial reduction in quality of life. In addition, not all patients respond to a gluten-free diet. Patients diagnosed with celiac disease may continue to have or re-develop symptoms despite being on a gluten-free diet (Rostom 2006). This suggests a need for a therapeutic agent for the treatment of celiac disease (Green, 2007; Hall, 2013).

Celiac disease represents a model of an autoimmune disorder in which the following elements are known:
1.The triggering environmental factor is glutenin or gliadin, the proline, glutamine and glycine rich glycoprotein fractions of gluten;
2.There is a close genetic association with HLA haplotypes DQ2 and/or DQ8; and
3.A highly specific humoral autoimmune response occurs.
Genetics of Celiac Disease

The high incidence of celiac disease in first degree relatives of celiac patients (10 − 15%) and high concordance rate in monozygotic twins (80%) suggest a strong genetic component. Gliadin deamidation by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) enhances the recognition of gliadin peptides by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 and DQ8 T cells in genetically predisposed subjects, which in turn may initiate the cascade of autoimmune reactions responsible for mucosal destruction. This interaction implies that gliadin and/or its breakdown peptides in some way cross the intestinal epithelial barrier and reach the lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa where they are recognized by antigen-presenting cells. The enhanced paracellular permeability of individuals with celiac disease would allow passage of macromolecules through the paracellular spaces with resulting autoimmune inflammation. There is a strong genetic predisposition to celiac disease, with major risk associated with HLA DQ2 (approximately 95% of celiac disease patients) and HLA-DQ8 (approximately 5% of celiac disease patients). The prevalence of celiac disease in the U.S. is estimated to be approximately 1%; however approximately 30% of the general U.S. population is HLA DQ2 positive (Figure 13), indicating that additional factors are involved in the development of celiac disease.

Figure 13: Distribution of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 in the general US population and in celiac disease. Source: J. Clin. Invest. 2007 Jan 2;117(1):41.

In celiac disease, an inflammatory reaction occurs in the intestine that is characterized by infiltration of immune cells in the lamina propria and epithelial compartments with chronic inflammatory cells and progressive architectural changes to the mucosa. Both adaptive and innate branches of the immune system are involved. The adaptive response is mediated by gluten-reactive CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria that recognize gluten-derived peptides when presented by the HLA class II molecules DQ2 or DQ8. The CD4+ T cells then produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma. This results in an inflammatory cascade with the release of cytokines, anti-tTG antibodies, T cells and other tissue-damaging mediators leading to villous injury and crypt hyperplasia in the intestine. Anti-human tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies are also produced, which form the basis of serological diagnosis of celiac disease.

Anti-tTG Antibodies: Highly Sensitive and Specific Blood-based ELISA Diagnostic Test 

The current approach for diagnosis of celiac disease is to use anti-tissue transglutaminase-2 (tTG-2) antibody tests as an initial screen with definitive diagnosis from biopsy of the small intestine mucosa. The diagnosis of celiac disease is confirmed by demonstration of characteristic histologic changes in the small intestinal mucosa, which are scored based on criteria initially put forth by Marsh and later modified. In 2012, the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Guidelines allowed symptomatic children with serum anti-tTG antibody levels ≥10 times upper limit of normal to avoid duodenal biopsies after positive human leukocyte (HLA) test and serum anti-endomysial antibodies.

The need for multiple clinical and laboratory findings to diagnose celiac disease makes monitoring disease progression difficult. International guidelines have standardized definitions and criteria for the diagnosis of celiac disease, though there ais less clear guidance for follow-up and monitoring. After initial diagnosis, the American College of Gastroenterology recommends annual follow-up performed by a healthcare provider with knowledge of celiac disease. Recommendations for monitoring disease progression may include assessing symptoms, dietary compliance and repeating serology tests. 

Gluten and Food Labeling

Gluten is a complex molecule contained in several grains such as wheat, rye and barley. Gluten can be subdivided into two major protein subgroups according to its solubility in alcohol and aqueous solutions. These subclasses consist of gliadins, soluble in 40 − 70% ethanol and glutenins which are large, polymeric molecules insoluble in both alcohol and aqueous solutions. The gliadins and glutenins can be further subdivided into groups according to their molecular weight. Glutenins can be subdivided into low and high molecular weight proteins, while the gliadin protein family contains α-, β-, γ- and ω- types. Both glutenins and gliadins are characterized by a high amount of prolines (20%) and glutamines (40%) that protect them from complete degradation in the GI tract and make them difficult to digest. Currently 31 nine-amino acid peptide sequences in the prolamins of wheat and related species have been defined as being celiac toxic or celiac ‘‘epitopes’’. These epitopes are located in the repetitive domains of the prolamins, which are proline and glutamine-rich and the high levels of proline make the peptide resistant to proteolysis. In addition, the prolamin-reactive T cells also recognize these epitopes to a greater extent when specific glutamine residues in their sequences have been deamidated to glutamic acid by tTG-2. The immunodominant sequence after wheat challenge corresponds to a well-characterized 33 residue peptide from α-gliadin, ‘‘33-mer,’’ that is resistant to GI digestion (with pepsin and trypsin) and was initially identified as the major celiac toxic peptide in the gliadins.

The FDA finalized a standard definition of ‘‘gluten-free’’ in August 2013. As of August 5, 2014, all manufacturers of FDA-regulated packaged food making a gluten-free claim must comply with the guidelines outlined by the FDA (www.fda.gov/gluten-freelabeling). A ‘‘gluten free’’ claim still allows up to 20 ppm of gluten which leads to more than 100mg/day and up to 500 mg/day of gluten exposure. Due to the presence of gluten in foods, beer, liquor, cosmetics and household products, exposure is difficult to completely avoid and due to cross-contamination, celiac patients have increased risks of exposure to gluten, which can cause symptoms more frequently.

Non-GI Manifestations of Celiac Disease and Co-Morbidities

Headache, Gluten Ataxia: Nervous System Manifestation of Celiac Disease. The association between celiac disease and neurologic disorders has been supported by numerous studies over the past 40 years. While peripheral neuropathy and ataxia have been the most frequently reported neurologic extra-intestinal manifestations of celiac disease, a growing body of literature has established headache as a common presentation of celiac disease as well. The exact prevalence of headache among patients ranges from about 30% to 60% (Lebwohl, 2016).

Dermatitis herpetiformis: Skin Manifestation of Celiac Disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an inflammatory cutaneous disease characterized by intensely pruritic polymorphic lesions with a chronic-relapsing course, first described by Duhring in 1884. The only treatment for achieving and maintaining permanent control of DH is a strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. It appears in approximately 25% of patients with celiac disease of all ages, however mainly in adults and is a characteristic clinical presenting symptom.
Expanded Access Program
In January 2021, we instituted an Expanded Access Program for Larazotide. Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. Expanded access studies conducted under this program are uncontrolled, carried out by individual investigators and not typically conducted in strict compliance with cGCPs, all of which can lead to a treatment effect which may differ from that in placebo-controlled trials. These studies provide only anecdotal evidence of efficacy for regulatory review. These studies contain no control or comparator group for reference and these patient data are not designed to be aggregated or reported as study results. Moreover, data from such small numbers of patients may be highly variable. Information obtained from our Expanded Access Program may not reliably predict the efficacy of our product candidates in company-sponsored clinical trials and may lead to adverse events that could limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval with labeling that we consider desirable, or at all.
Product Candidates being Evaluated for Development in Rare and/or Orphan Indications
NM-102, a small molecule peptide, is being developed as a potential microbiome modulator and undergoing an indication selection process. NM-102 is expected to enter an IND-enabling pathway in 2021 and is a long-acting, degradation-resistant peptide, believed to be gut-restricted, and presumed to prevent gut microbial metabolites and antigens from trafficking into systemic circulation.
NM-003 is a proprietary long-acting GLP-2 agonist with improved serum half-life compared with short-acting versions, which we intend to progress through a clinical and regulatory pathway in an undisclosed orphan and rare GI indication. On December 9, 2020, we announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to NM-003, a proprietary long-acting GLP-2 receptor agonist, for prevention of acute graft versus host disease. NM-003, also called teduglutide, is designed as a long-acting injectable GLP-2 receptor agonist that utilizes proprietary XTEN® technology to extend circulating half-life. NM-003 is currently undergoing an indication selection process through an ongoing probability of technical and regulatory success analysis. 
 The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) grants orphan designation to advance the evaluation and development of safe and effective drugs and biologics to treat, prevent or diagnose rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Under the Orphan Drug Act, orphan designation qualifies drug sponsors for development incentives conferred by the FDA, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing.
NM-004 is a double-cleaved mesalamine with an immunomodulator. NM-102, NM-003 and NM-004 are being evaluated for development in rare and/or orphan indications via an ongoing probability of technical and regulatory success analysis. 
Our Intellectual Property

We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our product candidates and our processes. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, their methods of use and processes of manufacture and any other technology to which we have rights, as appropriate. Additionally, we have licensed the rights to intellectual property related to certain of our product candidates, including patents and patent applications that cover the products or their methods of use or processes of manufacture. The terms of the licenses are described below under the heading “Licensing Agreements.” We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
In addition to patents and applications that we have licensed, we are the owner or co-owner of patent applications that have been filed relating to potential expansion of our product pipeline. We are the owner or co-owner of 23 pending patent applications covering formulations of larazotide and related compounds and methods of use for larazotide and related compounds. Some of these applications are co-owned with North Carolina State University, University of Maryland, Baltimore, or Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. In addition, we are the owner of two pending patent applications relating to uses and formulations of APAZA and related molecules. We are also the owner of a pending patent application covering methods of use of GLP-1 agonists.

Our success will in part depend on the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, the validity and enforceability of our patents, the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets and our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology and products. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Licensing Agreements

License with Alba Therapeutics Corporation

In February 2016, we entered into a license agreement (the “Alba License”) with Alba Therapeutics Corporation (“Alba”) to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property relating to larazotide and related compounds.
Our initial area of focus for this asset relates to the treatment of celiac disease. We now refer to this program as NM-001. The license agreement gives us the rights to (i) patent families owned by University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and licensed to Alba, (ii) certain patent families owned by Alba and (iii) two patent families that are jointly owned by Alba and UMB. In connection with the Alba License, we also entered into a sublicense agreement with Alba under which Alba sublicensed the UMB patents to us (the “Alba Sublicense”).

As consideration for the Alba License, we agreed to pay (i) a one-time, non-refundable fee of $0.4 million at the time of execution and (ii) set payments totaling up to $151.5 million upon the achievement of certain milestones in connection with the development of the product, which milestones include the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 clinical trial, acceptance and approval of the New Drug Application, the first commercial sale and the achievement of certain net sales targets. The last milestone payment is due upon the achievement of annual net sales of NM-001 in excess of $1.5 billion. Upon the first commercial sale of NM-001, the license becomes perpetual and irrevocable. The term of the Alba Sublicense, for which we paid a one-time, non-refundable fee of $0.1 million, extends until the earlier of (i) the termination of the Alba License, (ii) the termination of the underlying license agreement, or (iii) an assignment of the underlying license agreement to us. During 2019, we paid Alba a milestone payment of $0.3 million for the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 3 clinical trial. If we are able to demonstrate sufficient financial resources to complete the trial, we have the exclusive option to purchase the assets covered by the license.

The patents covering the composition-of-matter for the larazotide peptide are recently expired. The Alba Therapeutics patent estate nevertheless includes issued patents that provide product exclusivity for NM-001 in the U.S. until June 4, 2031, not including patent term extensions that may apply upon product approval. Outside the U.S., the Alba Therapeutics patent estate includes issued patents that provide product exclusivity for NM-001 until February 9, 2027, not including patent term extensions that may apply in various jurisdictions.

Significant patents in the NM-001 patent estate include issued patents in the U.S. for methods of treating celiac disease with larazotide, (US Patents 8,034,776 and 9,279,807), of which the last to expire has a term to July 16, 2030. 
Other significant patents include the larazotide formulation patent family, which has three issued U.S. patents as well as 46 issued outside the U.S. The significant patents in the NM-001 patent estate formulation patent family includes patents covering the drug product composition-of-matter (US Patent 9,265,811) and corresponding methods of treatment (US Patents 8,168,594 and 9,241,969) for the larazotide formulation, with the last to expire patent having an expiration in the U.S. of June 4, 2031.
The Alba Therapeutics patent estate further includes one patent family relating to the clinical dose and use for NM-001, and which is pending in the U.S., Europe, Canada, China and Hong Kong. If issued, this patent would provide exclusivity for the NM-001 program through April 3, 2035, not including patent term extensions that may apply. 
License with Seachaid Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In April 2013, we entered into a license agreement (the “Seachaid License”) with Seachaid Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Seachaid”) to further develop and commercialize the licensed product, the compound known as APAZA, or NM-004. 
The license agreement gives us the exclusive rights to (i) commercialize products covered by the patents owned or controlled by Seachaid related to the composition, formulation, use, or manufacture of any NM-004 compound in the territory that includes the U.S., Canada, Japan and most countries in Europe and (ii) use, research, develop, export and make products worldwide for the purposes of such commercialization.

As consideration for the Seachaid License, we agreed to pay a one-time, non-refundable fee of $0.2 million at the earlier of the time we meet certain financing levels or 18 months following the execution of the agreement and set payments totaling up to $6.0 million upon the achievement of certain milestones in connection with the development of the product, filing of the New Drug Application, the first commercial sale and payments ranging from $1.0 million to $2.5 million based on the achievement of certain net sales targets. There are future royalty payments in the single digits based on achieving sales targets and we are required to pay Seachaid a portion of any sublicense revenue. The royalty payments continue for each licensed product and in each applicable country until the earlier of (i) the date of expiration of the last valid claim for such products or (ii) the date that one or more generic equivalents of such product makes up 50% or more of sales in the applicable country. The term of the Seachaid License extends on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the royalty period for the applicable product in the applicable country.
The Seachaid patent estate includes issued patents for: 
i.methods and compositions employing 4-aminophenylacetic acid, of which the last to expire has a term to August 29, 2021 (in the U.S.) and March 22, 2025 (in Europe); and
ii.synthesis of azo bonded immunoregulatory compounds, of which the last to expire has a term to May 31, 2028 (in the U.S.) and July 7, 2025 (in Europe).
License Agreement with Amunix
In connection with the Naia Acquisition, we entered into two amended and restated license agreements with Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Amunix”), pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with rights of sublicense, to lead molecules GLP-1 and GLP-2 fused to an XTEN amino acids sequence and other intellectual property referenced therein (the “Amunix Licenses”). Also in connection with the Naia Acquisition, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“Cedars”), pursuant to which we licensed the rights to GLP-1 Agonist for the treatment of SBS (the “Cedars License” and together with the Amunix Licenses, the “Naia Licenses”). Collectively, the Naia Licenses are intended to support our development of a therapy to treat SBS, which we refer to as NM-002.
Naia paid initial license fees and other development milestone payments due under the Naia Licenses prior to the Naia Acquisition, therefore, we did not pay any initial license fees upon the amendment and restatement of the original Naia Licenses. Pursuant to the terms of the Amunix Licenses, we agreed to expend in certain minimum financial amounts in direct support of development of the GLP-1 and GLP-2 products during specified development stages.
As consideration under the Amunix License for GLP-1, we agreed to pay Amunix certain royalty payments and (i) $70.4 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in the U.S. and major EU countries, (ii) $20.5 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in China and certain related territories, and (iii) $20.5 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in South Korean and certain other east Asian countries. As consideration under the Amunix License for GLP-2, we agreed to pay Amunix certain royalty payments and $60.1 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones in the U.S. and major EU countries.
As consideration under the Cedars License, we agreed to pay Cedars certain royalty payments and approximately $9.4 million in milestone payments upon achievement of future development and sales milestones.
The majority of the intellectual property licensed from Amunix is controlled and maintained by Amunix and relates to their proprietary XTEN fusion protein technology, including fusion protein compositions, methods of use, and methods of manufacturing.
Manufacturing and Supply

We contract with third parties for the manufacturing of all of our product candidates, and for pre-clinical and clinical studies and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and we have no plans to build any owned clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) eliminates the need to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel or consultants have extensive manufacturing experience overseeing CMOs.
As we further develop our molecules, we expect to consider secondary or back-up manufacturers for both active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for our product candidates in a timely manner. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands but we have not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical materials to date. We currently engage CMOs on a ‘‘fee for services’’ basis based on our current development plans. We plan to identify CMOs and enter into longer term contracts or commitments as we move our product candidates into Phase 3 clinical trials.

We believe alternate sources of manufacturing will be available to satisfy our clinical and future commercial requirements; however, we cannot guarantee that identifying and establishing alternative relationships with such sources will be successful, cost effective, or completed on a timely basis without significant delay in the development or commercialization of our product candidates. All of the vendors we use are required to conduct their operations under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, a regulatory standard for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.

Competition

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. Our potential competitors include both major and specialty pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of product candidates that are safer and more effective than competing products.
The competitive landscape in short bowel syndrome is currently limited, which we believe is due to the GLP-2 agonist approach dominating the field in part because of previous regulatory precedent set by the approved agent teduglutide. To our knowledge, there are two therapies (glepaglutide and apraglutide) currently in Phase 3 trials, both of which are GLP-2 agonists, as well as a dual GLP-1/GLP-2 agonist approach in Phase 1 (ZP7570). To our knowledge, there is no single agent approach dedicated to studying short bowel syndrome patients using a GLP-1 agonist approach other than NM-002. 

Product | Status | Mechanism | Company | Route | Product Type
Teduglutide (GATTEX) | Approved | GLP-2 agonist | Takeda | Subcutaneous; daily | Peptide 
Glepaglutide | Phase 3 | GLP-2 agonist | Zealand Pharma | Subcutaneous, weekly or bi-weekly | Peptide 
Apraglutide | Phase 3 | GLP-2 agonist | Vectiv Bio | Subcutaneous, weekly | Peptide 
ZP7570 | Phase 1 | GLP-1 agonist/GLP-2 agonist | Zealand Pharma | Subcutaneous | Peptide 

The competitive landscape in celiac disease is currently limited, which we believe is due to lack of significant past research and development investments and lack of recognition and education around the disease. To our knowledge, there are no late stage competitors entering Phase 3 clinical trials or any who have successfully completed Phase 2 studies to date. However, in recent years large pharmaceutical companies have begun to expand their focus areas to autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease, and given the unmet medical needs in these areas, we anticipate increasing competition. A few early-stage programs are active, including Takeda/PvP’s KumaMax (gluten degrading enzyme), Takeda’s TAK-101, Amgen/Provention Bio’s AMG-714 (an IL-15 MAb) and Dr. Falk Pharma/Zeria’s ZED-1227 (a tTG-2 inhibitor). ImmunogenX’s IMGX003 (two gluten degrading enzymes) failed to meet its primary endpoint in a Phase 2b trial in 2015, yet an NIH sponsored trial is evaluating a patient subset in a phase 2 trial launched in March 2019. ImmusanT discontinued their Phase 2b trial for their Nexvax2 vaccine due to lack of statistically meaningful protection from gluten exposure for celiac disease patients when compared with placebo. 

Product | Status | Mechanism | Company | Route | Product Type 
PRV-015/AMG-714 | Phase 2 | Anti-IL-15MAb | Provention Bio/Amgen | Subcutaneous;2x/month | MAb(humanized) 
TAK-101 | Phase 2 | Nanoparticle containing gliadin | Takeda/Cour Pharmaceuticals | IV | Gliadin peptides 
ZED-1227 | Phase 2a Europe | TGase-2 inhibitor | Zedira GmbH/Dr FalkPharma | Oral | Small molecule(peptidomimetic)
KumaMax | End of Phase 1 | Enzymatic degradation of gluten | Takeda/PvPBiologics | Oral | Recombinant enzyme 
IMGX003/Latiglutenase | Phase 2 | Two gluten degrading enzymes | ImmunogenX | Oral | Recombinant enzymes 

Figure 15: Current celiac drugs in development are still in pre-clinical to early Phase 2 proof-of-concept stage. No drugs have completed a successful Phase 2b efficacy trial other than larazotide.

Government Regulations

The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs, such as those we are developing. Along with third-party contractors, we will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Government Regulation of Drugs

Before any of our drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States, they must be approved by the FDA. The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee for each clinical site before a clinical trial can begin;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of all required clinical trials;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if required by the FDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually and when significant changes are made.

The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing, information and/or post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.

If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
A sponsor may seek approval of a product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drug candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, a new drug candidate is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition, fill an unmet medical need and demonstrate a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness in the treatment of that condition.  The FDA has granted larazotide Fast Track designation for celiac disease. 
A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for the following:
•More frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval;
•More frequent written correspondence from FDA about the design of the clinical trials;
•Priority review to shorten the FDA review process for a new drug from ten months to six months; and,
•Rolling review, which means 9 Meters can submit completed sections of its NDA for review by FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the application is completed before the entire application can be reviewed.

Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve an NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis. We may seek designation as a breakthrough therapy for some or all of our product candidates. 
If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include: 
•holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the product candidate;
•providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; 
•involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; 
•assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and
•considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller or more efficient clinical trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. 

Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

Orphan Drug Status

NM-002 has received orphan drug designation by the FDA. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug candidate intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.

As in the United States, designation as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union must be made before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.

The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements

Our sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs and interactions with healthcare professionals must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, anti-bribery and corruption laws and additional federal and state laws similar to the foregoing.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to them, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

In addition to the foregoing health care laws, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We adopted an anti-corruption policy as a part of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in January 2021. The anti-corruption policy mandates compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws applicable to our business throughout the world. However, we cannot assure you that such a policy or procedures implemented to enforce such a policy will protect us from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
Coverage and Reimbursement

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party payers. Third-party payers include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payers will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, we cannot be certain of this. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the cost-effectiveness and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective and thus may not be covered or sufficiently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, as each payer will make its own determination as to whether to cover a product and at what level of reimbursement. Thus, one payer’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payer will provide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow them to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could materially affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

By way of example, in 2010 the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. 
Legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Portions of the Affordable Care Act have been repealed in recent years and members of the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures continue to seek to overturn at least some remaining portions of the legislation and we expect they will continue to review and assess the Affordable Care Act and possibly alternative health care reform proposals. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.

We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future are unpredictable and the potential impact on our operations and financial position are uncertain, but may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and place additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.

Foreign Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement and privacy, can vary greatly from country to country.
Employees
We currently have 12 full-time employees and also engage consultants to provide services to us, including clinical development, manufacturing support, regulatory support, business development and general business operational support.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we put in place several safety measures for our employees, patients, healthcare providers and suppliers. These measures included, but were not limited to, substantially restricting travel, limiting access to our corporate office, including allowing employees to work remotely, providing personal protective equipment to employees, investigator sites and third-party vendors, implementing social distancing protocols, and coordinating safety protocols with our investigator sites.

We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act and therefore we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements. As an “emerging growth company:”
•we will present no more than two years of audited financial statements and no more than two years of related management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations;
•we will avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (this exemption was recently extended indefinitely for smaller reporting companies, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, with revenue of less than $100 million);
•we will provide less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and
•we will not require stockholder non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.

However, we have chosen to irrevocably opt out of the extended transition periods available under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although we will cease to be an “emerging growth company” upon the earliest of (1) December 31, 2021, (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in the Exchange Act.
