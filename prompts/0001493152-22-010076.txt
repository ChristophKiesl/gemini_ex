Item 1. | Business
----------------------------------------------------+---------

 
Fearless Films, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated as MYG Corp. in the State of Nevada on July 6, 2000. We subsequently underwent name changes to BisAssist, Inc. on December 21, 2000, to Cody Ventures Corporation on October 11, 2004, and to Paw4mance Pet Products International, Inc. on April 7, 2011. On September 26, 2014, we changed our name to Fearless Films, Inc. in anticipation of the acquisition of Fearless Films (Canada). On November 14, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Fearless Films (Canada), which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 467 Edgeley Blvd., Unit 2, Concord, ONT L4K 4E9 Canada and our telephone number is (888) 928-0184. Our website address is http://fearless.film.
 
Our auditors have issued an opinion that raises substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern based on our current financial position. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future, and/or its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay liabilities from normal business operations when due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, revenues, if revenues are generated from operations, and/or the sale and issuance of common stock, and/or the issuance of debt.
 
Business Development
 
On November 14, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Fearless Films (Canada). The intent of the acquisition was to engage in the business of providing professional services for short film and full-length feature film productions, distribution, and related services. In connection with the acquisition, Fearless Films (Canada) became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the former stockholders of Fearless Films (Canada) obtained control of the consolidated entity. On September 23, 2014, in connection with the acquisition of Fearless Films (Canada), we approved a one share for 1000 shares (1:1,000) reverse split of our outstanding common stock.
 
On September 21, 2018, we finalized negotiations with most of the holders of certain company debt and entered into agreements to restructure our capital. Thus, in exchange for cancelling debt with a total value of $120,845.80, the debt was converted into 129,845,200 shares of our common stock. The debt ranged in age from four months to nearly four years. At the same time, we issued a total of 3,300,000 shares of common stock to three directors in consideration for their service on the board of directors and, in the case of our CEO, for past services performed for the company in his capacity as CEO since March 2013. Also on the same date, we issued 30,250,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the Fearless Films (Canada) acquisition and the Administrative Services Agreement referenced above. As of December 31, 2018, and following these actions, 316,543,316 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding.
 
On December 12, 2019, we finalized an Equity Line with Crown Bridge Partners, LLC, pursuant to the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement executed December 3, 2019. Under the Equity Line, we have the right, from time-to-time, to deliver a put notice for a number of shares of common stock that Crown Bridge Partners is committed to purchase, for an aggregate amount up to $5,000,000 until December 3, 2022. Each put notice is subject to certain volume limitations. Shares issued under the Equity Line must be registered with the SEC, which was accomplished by the registration statement on Form S-1 for the resale of shares that was declared effective on February 11, 2020. See “Equity Purchase Agreement with Crown Bridge Partners, LLC” under Item 7.
 
On December 8, 2020, we effected a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a one share for 10 shares (1:10) basis. The reverse stock split was approved on October 26, 2020 unanimously by our Board of Directors and by a majority of our common stock voting power. All references to our common stock hereafter shall reflect the one for ten shares reverse stock split, unless otherwise noted.
 
Fearless Films (Canada), is an independent full-service production company and has been positioning itself to ultimately produces top quality entertainment. We intend to specialize in short film and feature film production in addition to script writing, copywriting, fulfillment and distribution. Because of a lack of adequate funding, we have not realized revenues since our acquisition, but management believes we are in a position to become fully operational with the infusion of new capital. Since inception and prior to our acquisition, Fearless Films (Canada) has produced more than ten films and also a pilot for a series, The My Ciccio Show.

We are currently engaged in the business of providing professional services for all forms of short film and full-length feature film productions, ranging from directing and creative directing through post-production and fulfillment. Our business is operated though our subsidiary, Fearless Films (Canada), an independent full-service production company. Our primary business is video production services. Video projects are divided into four parts: (i) pre-production, (ii) production, (iii) post-production and (iv) distribution. During pre-production, the client describes the need and the purpose of the production. Production is the part of the process where raw materials that will be formed into the final product are created. This could include such activities as recording material in one or more cameras to produce 2d and 3d effects. Post-production is where the first rough cut of the final product is created. Client input is then used to create the final version of the production.
 
Our primary markets are Media & Entertainment companies (short films, feature films, TV drama, broadcast programs), Animation and Multimedia companies. We provide directing, creative, video capture, video editing and full range of postproduction services to these target markets.
 
Because our business is customer-driven, our revenue requirements will be reviewed and adjusted based on sales. Costs associated with operating as a public company are included in management’s budget. Management will be responsible for the preparation of much of the required documents to keep the costs to a minimum.
 
Description of Products and Services
 
Fearless Films (Canada) offers itself as a full-service video production provider. Services include production elements such as creative brief, script writing, talent acquisition, voice overs, soundtracks and graphical animation. Our primary markets for services are directors, writers, and those in need of post-production and distribution / fulfillment. We intend to rely on Victor Altomare to oversee these services due to his extensive industry experience and technical and creative expertise. Many of these tasks will be carried out by consultants and contract specialists.
 
Video and film production
 
We are capable of producing short film and full-length feature films. We can handle the full project development cycle, from directing and creative directing through post-production and fulfillment, depending on the needs of the client. We use professional film equipment and record films in formats such as high definition, Full HD and 4k, resulting in cinema-quality output. Through our industry relationships, management believes we can obtain filming locations at competitive prices, procure staging and lighting in addition to facilitating full post production needs and demands.
 
Animation and Special Effects
 
Our network of video studio specialists can develop computer graphics: 2-d and 3-d animation, motion design and visual effects on behalf of our clients.
 
Talent acquisition
 
Fearless Films (Canada) assists producers in in identifying on-screen talent, script writers and other film creatives such as makeup artists and creative directors.
 
Editing
 
Our editing specialists carry out editing, make corrections and suggestions, and then implement color correction and final mixing of sound.
 
Distribution
 
From a business perspective, our primary goal is to maximize revenues and seek to maximize the return on investment for our stockholders. However, there can be no assurance that this goal will be achieved or that increased revenues will equate to a higher return on investment. The ultimate commercial success of any video product is dependent on its distribution. Our primary market of service is Canada and the United States. Through our industry connections, we can arrange distribution for our clients’ films, including both theatrical and digital distribution.
 
We plan to approach prospective distributors with completed trailers, thus potentially enhancing bargaining positions with respect to negotiating the terms of distribution arrangements. We also plan to present trailers at the major film markets held each year in the USA.

We have full interest in the theatrical film “The Great Chameleon.” The movie, produced in 2012 and released in 2013, features actors Stacy Keach, Robert Davi and Victor Altomare, who was also co-writer and co-producer of the film. The Great Chameleon is available for streaming distribution through Amazon Video (UK) and for rent or purchase through various outlets and services.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Our current service scope is geared primarily towards directors, writers, and people in need of post-production and distribution/fulfillment. Our marketing strategy includes a diverse range of promotional communications. Our primary marketing channel is professional networking, using the existing industry connections that we have. A key component of our marketing strategy is to seek alliances with video companies that have industry credibility, presence, and distribution. Our professional networking efforts also include attending trade shows, industry events, meetings and seminars at events such as the Professional Videographers Association, Association of Video Professional, Digital Video Professionals Association. In terms of geography, our target markets are in North America. We also use online marketing as part of efforts to attract customers and promote and distribute our products. Our primary online interface is through our website. We supplement this with online marketing efforts, including advertising, links from Internet directories to our website and referrals from blogs. Our plan is to use Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to have Fearless Films show near the top of the list of relevant Internet searches.
Our Business Strategy
 
Our strategy has two elements: (i) utilize our current connections and skills to build a revenue-producing film services business; and (ii) become an independent producer of television and movie content.
 
We are currently focused on providing video production services to professional video production companies. Video projects are divided into four parts: (i) pre-production, (ii) production, (iii) post-production and (iv) distribution. During pre-production, the client describes the need and the purpose of the production. We then handle everything from directing and creative directing through post-production and fulfillment, depending on the needs of the client. Our services include: Video, TV and film production; talent selection; distribution; animation and special effects; editing; sound mixing; creative writing; and a full range of post-production services.

We intend to add online marketing, including advertising, links from Internet directories to our website, referrals from blogs, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to have Fearless Films show near the top of the list of relevant Internet searches.
 
Employees
 
We are currently in the early stage of developing our business plan, during which we intend to rely exclusively on the services of our officers and directors to set up our business operations. We believe that our operations are currently on a small scale that is manageable by our officers and directors.
 
Film production professionals we plan to use will be considered independent contractors. We do not intend to enter into any employment agreements with any of these professionals. Thus, these persons are not intended to be employees of the company.
 
Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, marketing, production and post-production contract workers. We currently have no full-time employees.
 
Employee Stock Plan
 
We have not adopted any kind of stock or stock option plan for employees at this time.

Competition
 
The television and movie production industries are intensely competitive. Competition comes from companies within the same business and companies in other entertainment media that create alternative forms of entertainment. The industry is currently evolving in such a way that certain multinational multimedia firms will be able to dominate this space because of their control over key film, magazine, and television content, as well as key network and cable outlets. These organizations have numerous competitive advantages, such as the ability to acquire financing for their projects and to make favorable arrangements for the distribution of completed product. All of our competitors will likely be organizations of substantially larger size and capacity, with far greater financial and personnel resources and longer operating histories. Competitors may be better able to acquire properties, personnel and financing, and enter into more favorable distribution agreements. Our future success will largely depend on public taste, which is both unpredictable and susceptible to rapid change. As an independent production company, we most likely will not have the backing of a major studio for production and distribution support. Consequently, we may not be able to complete a distribution deal.
 
In order to be competitive, we intend to create and/or acquire innovative concepts that may appeal to a wide range of public tastes both in the United States and abroad. Moreover, by producing our products in Canada we believe that we will be able to significantly reduce production costs and, thereby offer our products to distributors at competitive pricing.
 
There are many companies in the Motion Picture & Video Tape Production market, most of which are larger, more experienced and better financed that Fearless Films. Currently, our competitive position within the industry is small because our operations have been limited by available cash. We believe we have the ability to compete favorably as a freelance video production company in the Media & Entertainment industry because of the following:
 

● | Expertise of management 
--+----------------------------
● | Flexibility 
● | Value in pricing 

 
However, if we are not able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, it will be difficult to acquire and retain clients. We would then experience revenue declines, reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value in our services. Thus, it will be important that we engage and retain qualified and experienced personnel and develop a strong marketing strategy.
 
Research and Development
 
The market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent technology shifts and introductions. We believe that our future success depends in large part upon our ability to continue to adopt the functionality and standards of new film production technology. We intend to extend the functionality of our technology and develop new products by continuing to invest in our tools and studio infrastructure.
 
Most development work for our customers is conducted in-house. We also use independent contractors to assist with certain product development activities. We believe our future success relies on continued service offerings and enhancement. To accomplish this objective, we intend to seek to improve delivery reliability, advance and broaden employed technologies while maintaining or reducing production costs. In addition, we actively investigate new production equipment and standards.
 
We intend to continue to focus on services innovation, quality improvement, performance enhancement and on-time delivery while striving for delivered product cost improvements to promote added value for our services. We seek growth opportunities through the development of new applications for existing services, technological improvements for both new and existing markets and the acquisition and development of new tools/products and competencies.

Production
 
The company intends to produce its trailers and movies at the lowest possible cost consistent with the quality that it seeks to achieve. We will attempt to avoid substantial overhead associated with major production companies by maintaining minimal staff. We own some production equipment, but will adopt the standard Industry practice of renting production facilities and equipment and engaging free-lance production staff on an “as-needed” basis.
 
We expect the total production period for a company-produced trailer to generally continue for as long as three months and, in some instances, even longer. Feature-length movie production may take up to 12 months or longer. Multiple projects may run concurrently, should we have sufficient funds available to do so.
 
Strategic Relationships
 
We currently do not have any material strategic relationships. Management’s goal is to seek out and develop meaningful relationships with individuals and entities that can enhance the fulfillment of our business plan.
Intellectual Property
 
As a general practice, we will rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect and maintain our proprietary rights for our products. There are no inherent factors or circumstances associated with this industry, or any of the products or services that we expect to be providing that would give rise to any patent, trademark or license infringements or violations. We have not entered into any franchise agreements or other contracts that have given, or could give rise to obligations or concessions. Our web domain and IP address as well as company information will be protected by our domain host. We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.
 
Rights to motion pictures are granted legal protection under the copyright laws of the United States and most foreign countries, including Canada. These laws provide substantial civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized duplication and exhibition of motion pictures. Motion pictures, musical works, sound recordings, artwork, and still photography are separately subject to copyright under most copyright laws. We plan to take appropriate and reasonable measures to secure, protect, and maintain copyright protection for all of our products under the laws of the applicable jurisdictions. Motion picture piracy is an industry-wide problem.
 
Under the copyright laws of Canada and the United States, copyright in a motion picture is automatically secured when the work is created and “fixed” in a copy. We intend to register our films for copyright with both the Canadian Copyright Office and the United States Copyright Office. Both offices will register claims to copyright and issue certificates of registration, but neither will “grant” or “issue” copyrights. Only the expression (camera work, dialogue, sounds, etc.) fixed in a motion picture can be protected under copyright. Copyright in both Canada and the United States does not cover the idea or concept behind the work, or any characters portrayed in the work. Registration with the appropriate office establishes a public record of the copyright claim.
 
Ordinarily, a number of individuals contribute authorship to a motion picture, including the writer, director, producer, camera operator, editor and others. Under the laws of both the United States, and Canada, these individuals are not always considered the “authors,” however, because a motion picture is frequently a “work made for hire.” In the case of a work made for hire, the employer, not the individuals who actually created the work, is considered the author for copyright purposes. We intend all of our films to be works made for hire in which we will be the authors and thereby own the copyright to our films.
 
Canada’s copyright law is distinguished from that of the United States by recognizing the moral rights of authors. Moral rights refer to the rights of authors to have their names associated with their work, and the right to not have their work distorted, mutilated or otherwise modified, or used in association with a product, service, cause or institution in a way that is prejudicial to their honor or reputation. Moral rights cannot be sold or transferred, but they can be waived. We intend that all individuals who contribute to the creation of any of our motion pictures will be required to waive any such moral rights that they may have in the motion picture.
 
For copyright purposes, publication of a motion picture takes place when one or more copies are distributed to the public by sale, rental, lease or lending. Publication also refers to an offering made to distribute copies to a group of persons (wholesalers, retailers, broadcasters, motion picture distributors, and the like), for purposes of further distribution or public performance. A work that is created (fixed in tangible form for the first time) on or after January 1, 1978, is automatically protected from the moment of its creation. The work is ordinarily given a term enduring for the author’s life plus an additional 70 years after the author’s death. For works made for hire, the duration of copyright will be 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.

Although we plan to copyright all of our film properties and projects, there is no practical protection from films being copied by others without payment to us, especially overseas. We may lose an indeterminate amount of revenue as a result of motion picture piracy. Being a small company, with limited resources, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to pursue our various remedies. Motion picture piracy is an international as well as a domestic problem. It is extensive in many parts of the world.
 
Government Regulations
 
We are aware that the cost of producing and distributing filmed entertainment has increased substantially in recent years. This is due, among other things, to the increasing demands of creative talent as well as industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. Many screenplay writers, performers, directors and technical personnel in the entertainment industry who will be involved in our productions, are members of guilds or unions that bargain collectively on an industry-wide basis. We have found that actions by these guilds or unions can result in increased costs of production and can occasionally disrupt production operations. If such actions impede our ability to operate or produce a motion picture, it may substantially harm our ability to earn revenue and result in our business to fail.
 
We intend to use non-unionized talent whenever possible to reduce our costs of production. Notwithstanding, many individuals associated with our productions, including actors, writers and directors, will be members of guilds or unions, that bargain collectively with producers on an industry-wide basis from time to time. Our operations will be dependent upon our compliance with the provisions of collective bargaining agreements governing relationships with these guilds and unions. Strikes or other work stoppages by members of these unions could delay or disrupt our activities. The extent to which the existence of collective bargaining agreements may affect us in the future is not currently known.
 
Industry Background
 
Movie Distribution
 
We believe that the availability of low-cost, high-quality production equipment combined with the ability to distribute product via the Internet, may be fundamentally changing the way feature-length movies are distributed. Often, a movie that was accepted by a distributor would see a revenue split, reasonably expected in the 50-50 range, with no guarantee of distribution or revenue. In some cases, an up-front payment might be paid to offset production costs. Today, movies can be self-distributed via the Internet without the involvement of a distributor. This said, there are material costs associated with Internet marketing and those costs could render the movie unprofitable. Independent films, such as the company produces, may be inexpensive to produce, but they are very difficult to have been seen. Submissions to film festivals are an attempt to attract distributors, but there is no guarantee that film festivals will generate any distribution agreements.
United States Television Distribution
 
Television rights in the United States are generally licensed first to pay television for an exhibition period following home video release. Thereafter, they go to network television for an exhibition period, then to pay television again, and finally syndicated to independent stations. Therefore, the owner of a property may receive payments resulting from television licenses over a period of six years or more.
Cable and Pay Television
 
Pay television rights include rights granted to cable, direct broadcast satellite, microwave, pay per view and other services paid for by subscribers. Cable and pay television networks usually license properties for initial exhibition commencing six to twelve months after initial domestic theatrical release, if any, as well as for subsequent showings. Some pay television services have required exclusivity as a precondition to such contracts. The pay television market is characterized by a large number of sellers and few buyers. However, the number of properties utilized by these buyers is extremely large.

-

Network Television
 
In the United States, broadcast network rights are granted to ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX or other entities formed to distribute programming to a large group of stations. Commercial television networks in the United States license properties for a limited number of exhibitions.
Television Syndication
 
If the producer has entered into a commercial television network license, the property may be shown shortly after its completion through a number of outlets. This activity, known as “syndication,” has become an important source of revenues as the number of, and competition for, programming among local television stations has increased.
Foreign Television Syndication
 
Properties are now being licensed in foreign television market in a manner similar to that in the United States. The number of foreign television stations, as well as the modes of transmission such as pay, cable, network and satellite, have been expanding rapidly and the value of such markets has been likewise increasing. Management believes that this trend will continue to expand. Producers may license properties to foreign television stations during the same period they license such properties to television stations in the United States. However, governmental restrictions and the timing of the initial foreign theatrical release of the property in the territory, may delay exhibition of such properties in such territory.
Re-licensing
 
Collective retained rights in a group of previously produced properties is often a key asset, as such properties may be re-licensed in the pay and commercial television, home video and non-theatrical markets.
Facilities
 
Our principal corporate offices are located at 467 Edgeley Blvd., Unit 2, Concord, ONT L4K 4E9 Canada and our telephone number is (888) 928-0184. These facilities are offered to us on a rent-free basis by one of our stockholders. The location includes office space and meeting room, video editing, mixing and sound production facilities.
Industry Segments
 
No information is presented regarding industry segments. We are presently an emerging company
 engaged in the business of providing professional services for all forms of short film and full-length feature film productions.
 
Plan of Operation
 
We are a television and movie production company providing production services to film producers and others. Over the next 12 to 24 months, we have plans to undertake production of a full-length feature film under our own name, based on a script that we will select.
 
During the next 12 months we intend to concentrate our efforts in two areas; (i) administration, and (ii) film development. Administrative costs will include the expense of maintaining our public company status, including legal and accounting fees, as well expenses for maintaining our principal place of business and other operating facilities, for salaries and compensation for key personnel. We estimate these costs to be approximately $275,000, of which $100,000 will be costs for reporting and compliance with public company obligations. Our film development budget is expected to be between $3.0 million and $5.0 million. Typical film budgets break down along the lines of; (i) 10% for writing, (ii) 20% for the cast, (iii) 50% for production, (iv) 15% for post-production, and (v) 5% for other costs.

-


We anticipate that our first planned production will be based on the following time and cost estimates: (i) Script development – approximately three months at a cost of $75,000; (ii) Storyboarding – approximately two months for a cost of $10,000; (iii) Pre-production, including sourcing equipment and talent – approximately two months and $1.0 million; Production – approximately three months and $2.0 million; and (v) Post-production – approximately four months and $2.0 million.
 
At this time management is not able to predict when it will identify our first project and precisely how financing will be secured. Management continues to explore and investigate potential projects and a final decision will be based on the perceived potential merit of the project and the feasibility of securing necessary funding.
Management anticipates that it will be able to use its network of contacts and industry relationships as a potentials sales team. As future revenue increases, we plan to hire a sales team, but currently there are no agreements or arrangements in place for the sales team.
 
We expect that financing to fund our future plans will come from private issuances of our securities, debt and/or equity. There can be no assurances that the company will be able to raise the necessary funds when needed.
 
Special risk factor related to the COVID-19 pandemic
 
The occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We are in the early stages of developing our business plan of building a revenue-producing film service business and becoming an independent producer of television and movie content. Because our business is customer-driven, our revenue requirements will be reviewed and adjusted based on future revenues. Expenses associated with operating as a public company are included in management’s budget. The occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to negatively affect our operations. A pandemic such as COVID-19 can result in social distancing, travel bans and quarantines, which can lead to limited access to customers, management, support staff, consultants and professional advisors. These, in turn, will not only impact our operations, financial condition and demand for our services and products, but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of the event. It may also substantially hamper our efforts to provide investors with timely information and our ability to comply with filing obligations with the SEC.
