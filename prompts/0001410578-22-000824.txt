ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a British Virgin Island (“BVI”) business company on February 23, 2021. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”).
On June 9, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 5,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”) and one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, which the underwriters exercised in full simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 5,750,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in a total gross proceeds of $57,500,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) with BSG First Euro Investment Corp., the Company’s sponsor, of 292,500 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,925,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
A total of $58,075,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders at JPMorgan Chase Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination and (ii) the Company’s failure to consummate a business combination by June 14, 2022 (or December 14, 2022, as applicable).
Merger Agreement
On November 18, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Original Merger Agreement”) dated November 18, 2021 by and among the Company, Blue Safari Mini Corp., an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“SPAC Sub”), and Bitdeer Technologies Holding Company, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Bitdeer”).
On December 15, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) by and among (i) the Company, (ii) Bitdeer Technologies Group, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“BTG”), (iii) Blue Safari Merge Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (“Merger Sub 1”), (iv) Blue Safari Merge II Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (“Merger Sub 2”), (v) Bitdeer Merge Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTG (“Merger Sub 3”, and together with BTG, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, the “Acquisition Entities”), (vi) SPAC Sub, and (vii) Bitdeer, to amend and restate the Original Merger Agreement.

1



The Merger Agreement amended and restated the Original Merger Agreement to effect a change in structure of the business combination without affecting any underlying economic interests, whereby (a) Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity (the “First SPAC Merger”) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of BTG, (b) immediately following the First SPAC Merger, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub 2 with Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity (the “Second SPAC Merger”, and together with the First SPAC Merger, the “Initial Mergers”), and (c) following the Initial Mergers, Merger Sub 3 will merge with and into Bitdeer (the “Acquisition Merger” and together with the Initial Mergers, the “Mergers”), with Bitdeer being the surviving entity and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of BTG. The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company, BTG, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, and Bitdeer.
The Mergers and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Business Combination”) are expected to be consummated after obtaining the required approval by the shareholders of the Company and Bitdeer and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions.
Merger Consideration
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the effective time of the First SPAC Merger, each outstanding units of the Company shall automatically be detached and the holder thereof shall be deemed to hold such number of Class A ordinary shares and rights of the Company in accordance with the terms of the applicable units. In addition, upon the effective time of the First SPAC Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding ordinary share in the Company will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive one class A ordinary share in BTG (“BTG Class A Ordinary Share”), which will trade in the United States in the form of American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), and (ii) each SPAC Right will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a BTG Class A Ordinary Share in the same manner as SPAC Ordinary Share as set forth in subclause (iii) with fractional shares to be either rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of British Virgin Islands law.
Upon the effective time of the Acquisition Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding ordinary share and preferred share in Bitdeer will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive such number of BTG Class A Ordinary Share equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement), which will trade in the United States in the form of ADSs, provided that each issued and outstanding Key Executive Share (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive such number of Class V Ordinary Shares in BTG equal to the Exchange Ratio; (ii) each issued and outstanding Company restricted share unit will be converted into an award of restricted share units, representing the rights to receive BTG Class A Ordinary Share under the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan of BTG, each subject to substantially the same terms, as adjusted for the Exchange Ratio; (iii) the outstanding Company Convertible Note (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be assumed by BTG and represent the rights to receive BTG Class A Ordinary Share, subject to the same terms and conditions, as adjusted for the Exchange Ratio; and (iv) each Dissenting Share (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will represent only the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Representations and Warranties; Covenants
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of each of the parties thereto that are customary for transactions of this type, many of which are qualified by materiality and “Material Adverse Effect” (as defined in the Merger Agreement) standards. The representations and warranties of the respective parties to the Merger Agreement will not survive the closing of the Acquisition Merger (the “Acquisition Closing”).
The Merger Agreement contains certain covenants, including, among other things, providing for (i) the parties to conduct their respective business in the ordinary course through the Acquisition Closing; (ii) the parties to not initiate any negotiations or enter into any agreements for certain transactions; (iii) the Company to prepare and file a registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) and take certain other actions to obtain the approval of the Transactions by the shareholders of the Company; and (iv) the parties to use reasonable best efforts to consummate and implement the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

2



Conditions to Each Party’s Obligations
The Closings are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions by the parties thereto, including, among others, (i) approval of the mergers and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the shareholders of the Company and Bitdeer; (ii) effectiveness of the Registration Statement; (iii) expiration or termination of the waiting period under antitrust laws; and (iv) receipt of approval for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market of BTG’s securities.
The obligations of the Company and SPAC Sub (the "Blue Safari Parties") to consummate the Transactions also are conditioned upon, among other things, (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Bitdeer and the Acquisition Entities (subject to customary bring-down standards), (ii) the covenants of Bitdeer and the Acquisition Entities having been performed in all material respects; and (iii) no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) with respect to Bitdeer and the Acquisition Entities shall have occurred.
The obligations of Bitdeer to consummate the Transactions also are conditioned upon, among other things, (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Blue Safari Parties (subject to customary bring-down standards), and (ii) the covenants of Blue Safari Parties having been performed in all material respects.
Termination
The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Acquisition Closing,
(i) by mutual consent of the Company and Bitdeer;
​
(ii) by either the Company or Bitdeer if the Transactions are not consummated on or before May 31, 2022, provided that the terminating party’s failure to fulfill any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement is not the primary cause of the failure of the Acquisition Closing to occur by such date;
​
(iii) by either the Company or Bitdeer if a governmental entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of permanently enjoining or prohibiting the Merger, which order, decree, judgment, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable;
​
(iv) by either the Company or Bitdeer if, at the special meeting of the Company’s shareholders, the Transactions and the other Blue Safari Shareholder Approval Matters shall fail to be approved;
​
(v) by the Company if Bitdeer shall fail to obtain Bitdeer Shareholder Approval within five (5) business days after the effectiveness date of the Registration Statement; or
​
(vi) by the Company, Bitdeer or any Acquisition Entity if the other party has materially breached any of its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants which would result in the failure of certain conditions to be satisfied at the Closing and has not cured its breach prior to the earlier of 15 days of the notice of describing the breach and the Outside Closing Date, provided that the terminating party is not in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement that would cause the failure of the Closing to occur.
​
Voting and Support Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, BTG, the Company and Bitdeer also entered into a voting and support agreement (the “Voting and Support Agreement”) with certain Bitdeer shareholder (the “Supporting Shareholder”) with respect to the shares of Bitdeer currently owned by the Supporting Shareholder. The Voting and Support Agreement provides that the Supporting Shareholder will appear at shareholders meetings of Bitdeer and vote, consent or approve the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, whether at a shareholder meeting of Bitdeer or by written consent. It further provides that the Supporting Shareholder will vote against (or act by written consent against) any alternative proposals or actions that would impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the Merger or any of the Transactions.

In connection with the business combination, we filed and will file relevant materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including a proxy statement on Schedule 14A. Promptly after filing our definitive proxy statement with the SEC, we will mail the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each shareholder entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting relating to the business combination. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT THE COMPANY WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY, BITDEER AND THE MERGERS. The preliminary proxy statement, the definitive proxy statement and other relevant materials in connection with the acquisition (when they become available), and any other documents filed by us with the SEC, may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or by writing to us at 17 State Street, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10004.
Competitive Strengths
If the transaction with Bitdeer does not close, we believe that our management team is well positioned to identify and implement attractive business combination opportunities in an efficient manner. Through our management team’s network, we intend to execute a business combination and ultimately create returns for our shareholders through organic growth and/or follow-on acquisitions. Our management team is led by Alex Yamashita.
We believe the experience and contacts of our management team will give us distinct advantages in sourcing, structuring and consummating acquisition transactions. Mr. Alan Yamashita, our Chairman, has over 40 years of experience in the financial and equity investment industry having most recently been a managing partner at Polar Ventures, a private investment firm that provides capital and strategic solutions to companies in sectors important to the Asia region’s development. Mr. Alan Yamashita was previously executive advisor to Mizuho Alternative Investments LLC, president and chief executive officer of Search Investment Group, and founding chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Search Alternative Investment Limited, a major private global hedge fund and private equity investment practice with a multi-billion dollar portfolio. Mr. Alex Yamashita, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer, has over a decade of experience in investment, and entrepreneurship ranging from fintech and big data. Mr. Naphat Sirimongkolkasem, our Chief Financial Officer and Director, is the co-founder of Collis Capital and has valuable experience in management, business development and corporate finance transactions in Hong Kong and the PRC. Mr. Mark Streeter, our Independent Director is a Director of Investment Banking at JonesTrading, a U.S. brokerage firm, and has over a decade of experience in institutional capital markets and consulting in fintech and blockchain sectors. Mr. Joseph Chow, our Independent Director, has over two decades of experience in investment and legal practice, and has advised on a series of mergers and acquisitions, commercial transactions and intellectual property rights protection. Dr. Rolf Hoefer, our Independent Director, is a subject matter expert in the blockchain and fintech sector and has been extensively published, including in the well-known Academy of Management Review. He co-authored and lead a report on fintech and entrepreneurship, which was presented at the European Commission in 2013. Our management team’s past performance is not an assurance that we will be able to identify an appropriate candidate for our initial business combination or achieve success with respect to the business combination we intend to consummate. However, we believe that the skills and professional network of our management team will enable us to identify, structure and consummate a business combination.

Effecting an Acquisition Transaction
If the transaction with Bitdeer does not close, our acquisition strategy will be to capitalize on the strengths of our management team to allow us to identify businesses that have the capacity for cash flow creation, opportunity for operational improvement, robust company fundamentals, and qualified and driven management teams. Our deal sourcing process will leverage our management team’s industry experiences proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad network of relationships in numerous industries, including business executives, entrepreneurs, media relationships, institutional investors, family offices, investment bankers and attorneys. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest noncore assets or divisions. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
The COVID-19 coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, and potential target companies may defer or end discussions for a potential business combination with us whether or not COVID-19 affects their business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. We may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limiting our ability to conduct meetings to negotiate and consummate transactions in a timely manner with potential investors, target company’s personnel, or vendors and services providers.
Shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination
Although we may seek shareholder approval before we effect our initial business combination, we may not do so for business or legal reasons (so long as such transaction does not require shareholder approval under the Companies Act or the rules of Nasdaq). Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether we expect shareholder approval would be required under the Companies Act for each such transaction.
​

Type of Transaction | | WhetherShareholderApproval isRequired | 
Purchase of assets | ​ | No | ​
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | ​ | No | ​
Merger of target with a subsidiary of the company | ​ | No | ​
Merger of the company with a target | ​ | Yes | ​
Entering into contractual agreements with a target to obtain control | ​ | No | ​

​
Additionally, under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

● | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

We also may be required to obtain shareholder approval if we wish to take certain actions in connection with our initial business combination such as amending our memorandum and articles of association. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing of our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules.
Redemption rights for public shareholders upon consummation of our initial business combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.10 per share, whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the requisite time period. However, if our initial shareholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer.
We intend to hold a shareholder vote in connection with our business combination. In such case, we will:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

​
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval, we will consummate our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination.
We will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote in conjunction with our initial business combination for business or other legal reasons (so long as shareholder approval is not required by the Companies Act or the rules of Nasdaq), we will conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and our memorandum and articles of association. In such case, we will:

6




● | offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and we will not be permitted to consummate our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem shall remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act.
In connection with the successful consummation of our business combination, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. However, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our proposed initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares that are validly tendered plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not consummate the business combination, we will not purchase any shares pursuant to the tender offer and all shares will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer. Additionally, since we are required to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination (which may be substantially higher depending on the terms of our potential business combination), the chance that the holders of our ordinary shares electing to redeem in connection with a redemption conducted pursuant to the proxy rules will cause us to fall below such minimum requirement is increased.
When we conduct a tender offer to redeem our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in order to comply with the tender offer rules, the offer will be made to all of our shareholders, not just our public shareholders. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with any such tender offer.
Permitted purchases of our securities by our affiliates
If we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Although very unlikely, our initial shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination may be approved without the majority vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of purchases.
Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

7



The purpose of such purchases would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (2) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
As a consequence of any such purchases, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange following consummation of a business combination.
Tendering share certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights
We will require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the expiration date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or in the event we distribute proxy materials, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on our initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery at or prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not consummated, we may continue to try to consummate our initial business combination with a different target until 12 months from the closing of the IPO or up to 18 months if the sponsor extends the period of time.

Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we will complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the IPO. Our sponsor may decide to extend the period of time up to 18 months to consummate a business combination. We may not be able to find a suitable target business and consummate our initial business combination within such time period. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the IPO, or within up to 18 months from the closing of the IPO if our sponsor extends the period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses), pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs. This redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be effected as required by function of our memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Companies Act.
Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter “voluntary liquidation” which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the trust account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our trust account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands newspaper and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where the company has its principal place of business, and taking any other steps he considers appropriate to identify the company’s creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and file notice with the Registrar that the liquidation is complete. We would be dissolved once the Registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution.
Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period from the closing of the IPO.
However, if our initial shareholders, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our private units, which will expire worthless in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination within 12 months of the closing of the IPO, or within up to 18 months from the closing of the IPO if our sponsor extends the period. We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account or interest earned on the funds held in the trust account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors’ claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the BVI court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets.
Additionally, in any liquidation proceedings of the company under British Virgin Islands law, the funds held in our trust account may be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any such claims deplete the trust account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts payable to them.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.10 (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. The actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.10, plus interest (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses).

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.10 per share (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. Other than as described above, none of our other officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy his indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We believe the likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.10 per share (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be less than $10.10 per share (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full).
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $500,000 not placed in the trust with which to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $700,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the estimated $500,000 not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to hold outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $700,000 the amount of funds we intend to hold outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.

If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act (i.e. (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands Court in favor of a creditor of the company is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of the company’s liabilities exceeds its assets, or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a “voidable transaction” for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, payments made as “unfair preferences” or “transactions at an undervalue”. A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to the British Virgin Islands Courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part.
Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our trust account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account you may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them.
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of a redemption of the public shares prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination within 12 months of the closing of the offering, or within up to 18 months from the closing of the IPO if our sponsor extends the period, (ii) if they redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate or (iii) if they redeem their shares in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the IPO, or within up to 18 months from the closing of the IPO if our sponsor extends the period, or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity. In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding Rights and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to Maxim Group LLC upon consummation of our initial business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




● | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
Employees
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only minimal time while we are trying to locate a potential target business to additional time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
