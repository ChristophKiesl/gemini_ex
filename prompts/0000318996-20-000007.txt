ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General Description of Business
Key Energy Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the largest onshore, rig-based well servicing contractor based on the number of rigs owned. References to “Key,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this report refer to Key Energy Services, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled subsidiaries. We were organized in April 1977 in Maryland and commenced operations in July 1978 under the name National Environmental Group, Inc. In December 1992, we became Key Energy Group, Inc. and we changed our name to Key Energy Services, Inc. in December 1998. We reincorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 15, 2016.
We provide a full range of well services to major oil companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. Our services include rig-based and coiled tubing-based well maintenance and workover services, well completion and recompletion services, fluid management services, fishing and rental services, and other ancillary oilfield services. Additionally, certain rigs are capable of specialty drilling applications. We operate in most major oil and natural gas producing regions of the continental United States. An important component of the Company’s growth strategy is to make acquisitions that will strengthen its core services or presence in selected markets, and the Company also makes strategic divestitures from time to time. To that end, we completed the sale of our Canadian subsidiary and Russian subsidiary in the second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. The Company expects that the industry in which it operates will continue to experience consolidation, and as part of its strategy the Company actively explores opportunities arising out of this consolidation, which could include mergers, consolidations or acquisitions or further dispositions or other transactions, including by engaging in discussions with other industry participants concerning these opportunities. There can be no assurance that any such activities will be consummated.
Restructuring and Reverse Stock Split
On March 6, 2020, we closed the previously announced restructuring of our capital structure and indebtedness (the “Restructuring”) pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2020 (the “RSA”), with lenders under our Prior Term Loan Facility (as defined below) collectively holding over 99.5% (the “Supporting Term Lenders”) of the principal amount of the Company’s then outstanding term loans. Pursuant to or in connection with the RSA and the Restructuring contemplated thereby, among other things we effected the following transactions and changes to our capital structure and governance: 

• | immediately prior to the closing of the Restructuring, we completed a 1-for-50 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock as a result of which our issued and outstanding common stock decreased from 20,659,654 to 413,258 shares; accordingly, all share and per share information contained in this report has been restated to retroactively show the effect of this stock split;


• | pursuant to exchange agreements entered into at the closing of the Restructuring, we then exchanged approximately $241.9 million aggregate outstanding principal of our term loans (together with accrued interest thereon) held by Supporting Term Lenders under our Prior Term Loan Facility into (i) approximately 13.4 million newly issued shares of common stock representing 97% of the Company’s outstanding shares after giving effect to such issuance (and without giving effect to dilution by the New Warrants and MIP (each as defined below)) and (ii) $20 million of term loans under our new $51.2 million term loan facility (the “New Term Loan Facility”), each on a pro rata basis based on their holdings of term loans under the Prior Term Loan Facility; 


• | distributed to our common stockholders of record as of February 18, 2020 two series of warrants (the “New Warrants”);


• | entered into the $51.2 million New Term Loan Facility, of which (i) $30 million was funded at closing of the Restructuring with new cash proceeds from the Supporting Term Lenders and $20 million was issued in exchange for term loans held by the Supporting Term Lenders under the Prior Term Loan Facility as described above and (ii) an approximate $1.2 million was a senior secured term loan tranche in respect of term loans held by lenders under the Prior Term Loan Facility who were not Supporting Term Lenders;


• | entered into the New ABL Facility (as defined below);


• | adopted a new management incentive plan (the “MIP”) representing up to 9% of the Company’s outstanding shares after giving effect to the issuance of shares described above; and


• | made certain changes to the Company’s governance, including changes to our Board of Directors (the “Board”), amendments to our governing documents and entry into the Stockholders Agreement (as defined below) with the Supporting Term Lenders.

In accordance with the RSA at the closing of the Restructuring, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation and entered into a stockholders agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”) with the Supporting Term Lenders in order to, among other things, provide for a Board of seven members. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, our Board consists of our chief executive officer and six other members appointed by various Supporting Term Lenders. Specifically, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Supporting Term Lenders who hold more than 25% of the Company’s outstanding shares as of the closing 
4

Index to Financial Statements

of the Restructuring are entitled to nominate two directors and Supporting Term Lenders who hold between 10% and 25% of the Company’s outstanding shares as of the closing of the Restructuring are entitled to nominate one director. All appointees or nominees of Supporting Term Lenders, other than any directed appointed or nominated by Soter Capital LLC (“Soter”), must meet the “independent director” requirements set forth in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Supporting Term Lenders are entitled to appoint a non-voting board observer subject to specified ownership thresholds.
In accordance with the RSA and following the closing of the Restructuring, the Company distributed to stockholders of record as of February 18, 2020 the New Warrants. The New Warrants were issued in two series each with a four-year exercise period. The first series entitles the holders to purchase in the aggregate 1,669,730 newly issued shares of common stock, representing 10% of the Company’s common shares at the closing of the Restructuring on an as-exercised basis (after giving effect to the exercise of all New Warrants, but subject to dilution by issuances under the MIP). The aggregate exercise price of the first series of New Warrants is $19.23 and was determined based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of term loans under the Prior Term Loan Facility plus accrued interest thereon at the default rate as of the closing of the Restructuring. The second series of New Warrants entitles the holders to purchase in the aggregate 1,252,297 newly issued shares of common stock, representing 7.5% of the Company’s common shares at the closing of the Restructuring on an as-exercised basis (after giving effect to the exercise of all New Warrants, but subject to dilution by issuances under the MIP). The aggregate strike price of the second series of New Warrants is $28.85 and was determined based on the product of (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of term loans under the Prior Term Loan Facility plus accrued interest thereon at the default rate as of the closing of the Restructuring, multiplied by (ii) 1.50.
For more information on our New Term Loan Facility and New ABL Facility entered into in connection with the Restructuring, see Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Service Offerings
Our reportable business segments are Rig Services, Fishing and Rental Services, Coiled Tubing Services and Fluid Management Services. Our reportable business segments previously included an International segment. We also have a “Functional Support” segment associated with overhead and other costs in support of our reportable segments. Our Rig Services, Fluid Management Services, Coiled Tubing Services and Fishing and Rental Services operate geographically within the United States. The International reportable segment includes our former operations in Canada and Russia, which were sold in the second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross margin measures. All inter-segment sales pricing is based on current market conditions. See “Note 19. Segment Information” in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional financial information about our reportable business segments and the various geographical areas where we operate.
Rig Services
Our Rig Services include the completion of newly drilled wells, workover and recompletion of existing oil and natural gas wells, well maintenance, and the plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives. We also provide specialty drilling services to oil and natural gas producers with certain of our larger rigs that are capable of providing conventional and horizontal drilling services. Our rigs encompass various sizes and capabilities, allowing us to service all types of oil and gas wells. Many of our rigs are outfitted with our proprietary KeyView® technology, which captures and reports well site operating data and provides safety control systems. We believe that this technology allows our customers and our crews to better monitor well site operations, improves efficiency and safety, and adds value to the services that we offer.
The completion and recompletion services provided by our rigs prepare wells for production, whether newly drilled or recently extended through a workover operation. The completion process may involve selectively perforating the well casing to access production zones, stimulating and testing these zones, and installing tubular and downhole equipment. We typically provide a well service rig and may also provide other equipment to assist in the completion process. Completion services vary by well and our work may take a few days to several weeks to perform, depending on the nature of the completion.
The workover services that we provide are designed to enhance the production of existing wells and generally are more complex and time consuming than normal maintenance services. Workover services can include deepening or extending wellbores into new formations by drilling horizontal or lateral wellbores, sealing off depleted production zones and accessing previously bypassed production zones, converting former production wells into injection wells for enhanced recovery operations and conducting major subsurface repairs due to equipment failures. Workover services may last from a few days to several weeks, depending on the complexity of the workover.
Maintenance services provided with our rig fleet are generally required throughout the life cycle of an oil or natural gas well. Examples of these maintenance services include routine mechanical repairs to the pumps, tubing and other equipment, removing debris and formation material from wellbores, and pulling rods and other downhole equipment from wellbores to identify 
5

Index to Financial Statements

and resolve production problems. Maintenance services are generally less complicated than completion and workover related services and require less time to perform.
Our rig fleet is also used in the process of permanently shutting-in oil or natural gas wells that are at the end of their productive lives. These plugging and abandonment services generally require auxiliary equipment in addition to a well servicing rig. The demand for plugging and abandonment services is not significantly impacted by the demand for oil and natural gas because well operators are required by state regulations to plug wells that are no longer productive.
We believe that the largest competitors for our Rig Services include NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc., Basic Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., Forbes Energy Services Ltd., Pioneer Energy Services Corp and Ranger Energy Services, Inc. Numerous smaller companies also compete in our rig-based markets in the United States.
Fishing and Rental Services
We offer a full line of fishing services and rental equipment designed for use in providing onshore drilling and workover services. Fishing services involve recovering lost or stuck equipment in the wellbore utilizing a broad array of “fishing tools.” Our rental tool inventory consists of drill pipe, tubulars, handling tools (including our patented Hydra-Walk® pipe-handling units and services), pressure-control equipment, pumps, power swivels, reversing units and foam air units. Our rental inventory also included frac stack equipment used to support hydraulic fracturing operations and the associated flowback of frac fluids, proppants, oil and natural gas. We also had provided well-testing services. Our frac stack equipment and well-testing services were sold in the second quarter of 2017.
Demand for our Fishing and Rental Services is also closely related to capital spending by oil and natural gas producers.
Our primary competitors for our Fishing and Rental Services include Baker Oil Tools (owned by Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC), Weatherford International Ltd., Basic Energy Services, Inc., Smith Services (owned by Schlumberger), Superior Energy Services, Inc., Quail Tools (owned by Parker Drilling Company) and Knight Oil Tools. Numerous smaller companies also compete in our fishing and rental services markets in the United States.
Coiled Tubing Services
 Coiled Tubing Services involve the use of a continuous metal pipe spooled onto a large reel which is then deployed into oil and natural gas wells to perform various applications, such as wellbore clean-outs, nitrogen jet lifts, through-tubing fishing, and formation stimulations utilizing acid and chemical treatments. Coiled tubing, particularly larger diameter coil units, is also used for a number of horizontal well applications such as milling temporary isolation plugs that separate frac zones and various other pre- and post-hydraulic fracturing well preparation services.
Our primary competitors in the Coiled Tubing Services market include Schlumberger Ltd., Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC, Halliburton Company, Superior Energy Services, Inc., Nine Energy Services and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. Numerous smaller companies also compete in our coiled tubing services markets in the United States. Demand for these services generally corresponds to demand for well completion services.
Fluid Management Services
We provide transportation and well-site storage services for various fluids utilized in connection with drilling, completions, workover and maintenance activities. We also provide disposal services for fluids produced subsequent to well completion. These fluids are removed from the well site and transported for disposal in saltwater disposal (“SWD”) wells owned by us or a third party. Demand and pricing for these services generally correspond to demand for our well service rigs.
We believe that the largest competitors for our domestic fluid management services include Select Energy Services, Basic Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Forbes Energy Services Ltd., and Stallion Oilfield Services Ltd. Numerous smaller companies also compete in the fluid management services market in the United States.
International Segment
Our International segment included our former operations in Canada and Russia. We completed the sale of our Canadian subsidiary and Russian subsidiary in the second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. Our services in Russia consisted of rig-based services such as the maintenance, workover, and recompletion of existing oil wells, completion of newly-drilled wells, and plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives. Our Canadian subsidiary was a technology development and control systems business focused on the development of hardware and software related to oilfield service equipment controls, data acquisition and digital information flow.
Functional Support Segment
Our Functional Support segment includes unallocated overhead costs associated with sales, safety and administrative support for each of our reporting segments.

Equipment Overview
We categorize our rigs and equipment as active, warm stacked or cold stacked. We consider an active rig or piece of equipment to be a unit that is working, deployed, available for work or idle. A warm stacked rig or piece of equipment is a unit that is down for repair or needs repair. A cold stacked rig or piece of equipment is a unit that would require such significant investment to redeploy that we may salvage for parts, sell the unit or scrap the unit. The definitions of active, warm stacked or cold stacked are used for the majority of our equipment.
Rigs
As mentioned above, our fleet is diverse and allows us to work on all types of wells, ranging from very shallow wells to long horizontal laterals. Higher derrick lifting capacity rigs will be utilized to service the deeper wells and longer laterals as they require a higher pull weight and taller derrick. The lower derrick lifting capacity rigs are typically used on shallower, less complex wells. In most cases, these rigs can be reassigned to other regions should market conditions warrant the transfer of equipment. The following table summarizes our rigs based on derrick height measured in feet as of December 31, 2019: 
 | Derrick Height (Feet)
 | < 102’ | ≥ 102’ | | Total
Active | 89 | | 161 | | 250
Warm stacked | 173 | | 89 | | 262
Cold stacked | 250 | | 101 | | 351
Total | 512 | | 351 | | 863

Coiled Tubing
Coiled tubing uses a spooled continuous metal pipe that is injected downhole in oil and gas wells in order to convey tools, log, stimulate, clean-out and perform other intervention functions. Typically, larger diameter coiled tubing is able to service longer lateral horizontal wells. The table below summarizes our Coiled Tubing Services fleet by pipe diameter as of December 31, 2019:

 | Pipe Diameter (Inches)
 | < 2” | ≥ 2” < 2.375” | | ≥ 2.375” | Total
Active | 9 | | 1 | | 9 | 19
Warm stacked | 4 | | 3 | | 3 | 10
Cold stacked | 3 | | 3 | | 1 | 7 
Total | 16 | | 7 | | 13 | 36

Fluid Management Services
We have an extensive and diverse fleet of oilfield transportation service vehicles. We broadly define an oilfield transportation service vehicle as any heavy-duty, revenue-generating vehicle weighing over one ton. Our transportation fleet includes vacuum trucks, winch trucks, hot oilers and other vehicles, including kill trucks and various hauling and transport trucks. The table below summarizes our Fluid Management Services fleet as of December 31, 2019:

 | Active | Warm Stacked | | Cold Stacked | Total
Truck Type | | | | | 
Vacuum Trucks | 212 | | 100 | | 28 | 340
Winch Trucks | 85 | | 14 | | 4 | 103
Hot Oil Trucks | 10 | | 16 | | 10 | 36 
Kill Trucks | 34 | | 11 | | 9 | 54 
Other | 44 | | 6 | | 11 | 61 
Total | 385 | | 147 | | 62 | 594

Disposal Wells
As part of our Fluid Management Services, we provide disposal services for fluids produced subsequent to well completion. These fluids are removed from the well site and transported for disposal in SWD wells. The table below summarizes our SWD facilities, and brine and freshwater stations by state as of December 31, 2019:

 | Owned | Leased(1) | | Total
Location | | | | 
Arkansas | 1 | | — | | 1 
Louisiana | 2 | | — | | 2 
New Mexico | 1 | | 9 | | 10
Texas | 23 | | 24 | | 47
Total | 27 | | 33 | | 60


(1) | Includes SWD facilities as “leased” if we own the wellbore for the SWD but lease the land. In other cases, we lease both the wellbore and the land. Lease terms vary among different sites, but with respect to some of the SWD facilities for which we lease the land and own the wellbore, the land owner has an option under the land lease to retain the wellbore at the termination of the lease.

Other Business Data
Raw Materials
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are made by other manufacturers and suppliers for our use. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials.
Customers
Our customers include major oil companies, independent oil and natural gas production companies. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Chevron Texaco Exploration and Production accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. No customers accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. 
Competition and Other External Factors
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition is influenced by such factors as product and service quality and availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, equipment quality, reputation for safety and price. We believe that an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. We devote substantial resources toward employee safety and training programs. We believe many of our larger customers place increased emphasis on the safety, performance and quality of the crews, equipment and services provided by their contractors. Although we believe customers consider all of these factors, price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded the work. However, in numerous instances, we secure and maintain work for large customers for which efficiency, safety, technology, size of fleet and availability of other services are of equal importance to price.
The demand for our services and price we receive fluctuates, primarily in relation to the price (or anticipated price) of oil and natural gas, which, in turn, is driven for the most part by the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Generally, as supply of those commodities decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the productivity of their wells in a higher priced environment. However, in a lower oil and natural gas price environment, demand for service and maintenance generally decreases as oil and natural gas producers decrease their activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing field drilling and completion work is driven by available investment capital for such work. Because these types of services can be easily “started” and “stopped,” and oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we may experience a more rapid decline in demand for well maintenance services compared with demand for other types of oilfield services. Furthermore, in a low commodity price environment, fewer well service rigs are needed for completions, as these activities are generally associated with drilling activity.
The level of our revenues, earnings and cash flows are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of U.S. and international oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity, as well as the equipment capacity in any particular region.

Seasonality
Our operations are impacted by seasonal factors. Historically, our business has been negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather, fewer daylight hours and holidays. During the summer months, our operations may be impacted by tropical or other inclement weather systems. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may not be able to operate or move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues. In addition, the majority of our equipment works only during daylight hours. In the winter months when days become shorter, this reduces the amount of time that our assets can work and therefore has a negative impact on total hours worked. Lastly, during the fourth quarter, we historically experience a significant slowdown during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons and demand sometimes slows during this period as our customers exhaust their annual spending budgets.
Patents, Trade Secrets, Trademarks and Copyrights 
We own numerous patents, trademarks and proprietary technology that we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in the various markets in which we operate or intend to operate. We have devoted significant resources to developing technological improvements in our well service business and have sought patent protection for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. All the issued patents have varying remaining durations through 2035, and began expiring in 2019.
We own several trademarks that are important to our business. In general, depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use, or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to become generic. Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. While our patents and trademarks, in the aggregate, are of considerable importance to maintaining our competitive position, no single patent or trademark is considered to be of a critical or essential nature to our business.
We also rely on a combination of trade secret laws, copyright and contractual provisions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services. We typically enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, strategic partners and suppliers and limit access to the distribution of our proprietary information.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately two thousand persons. Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. As noted below in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” we have historically experienced a high employee turnover rate. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages associated with labor disputes or grievances and consider our relations with our employees to be generally satisfactory.
Governmental Regulations 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws or regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future. We also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations affecting our business will be adopted, or the effect such changes might have on us, our financial condition or our business. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject and for which a lack of compliance may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such laws.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations routinely involve the storage, handling, transport and disposal of bulk waste materials, some of which contain oil, contaminants and other regulated substances. Various environmental laws and regulations require prevention, and where necessary, cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials, and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials. Failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties, remediation orders and revocation of permits.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws, impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct of certain defined persons, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.
In the course of our operations, we occasionally generate materials that are considered “hazardous substances” and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly 
9

Index to Financial Statements

caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants. We also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state statutes.
Although we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past, or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, as amended, or “CAA,” and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls.
Global Warming and Climate Change
Some scientific studies suggest that emissions of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) may contribute to warming of Earth’s atmosphere. While we do not believe our operations raise climate change issues different from those generally raised by commercial use of fossil fuels, legislation or regulatory programs that restrict greenhouse gas emissions in areas where we conduct business could increase our costs in order to comply with any new laws.
Water Discharges
We operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the Clean Water Act, as amended, or “CWA,” and analogous state laws that impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements under the CWA require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill. Other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA,” which applies to owners and operators of vessels, including barges, offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities. Under OPA, regulated parties are strictly and jointly and severally liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees and state and local government authorities.
Saltwater Disposal Wells
We operate SWD wells that are subject to the CWA, Safe Drinking Water Act, and state and local laws and regulations, including those established by the Underground Injection Control Program of the Environmental Protection Agency, or “EPA,” which establishes the minimum program requirements. Most of our SWD wells are located in Texas. We also operate SWD wells in Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico. Regulations in these states require us to obtain an Underground Injection Control permit to operate each of our SWD wells. The applicable regulatory agency may suspend or modify one or more of our permits if our well operations are likely to result in pollution of freshwater, substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules, or if the well leaks into the environment.
Company Reports and Access to these Reports 
We are subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, and file or furnish Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our Web site address is www.keyenergy.com, and we make available free of charge through our Web site such reports, proxy statements and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. Our Web site also includes general information about us, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and charters for the committees of our board of directors. Information on our Web site or any other Web site is not a part of this report.
