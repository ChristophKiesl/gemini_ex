Overview
 
Through Healthcare Staffing, Inc. ("HCS"), our wholly-owned subsidiary acquired on July 27, 2017, we provide outsourced health care staffing and related services in the State of Georgia. The Company has also historically owned a portfolio of mortgage securities which generated earnings to support on-going financial obligations. These securities were marketed for sale and sold for a total of $13 million during 2018.  Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, is traded on OTC Pink under the symbol “NOVC”.
Recent Developments
 
Emergence from Bankruptcy. On July 20, 2016 (the “Bankruptcy Petition Date”), Novation and three of its subsidiaries, NovaStar Mortgage LLC (“NMLLC”), NovaStar Mortgage Funding Corporation ("NMFC") and 2114 Central LLC (the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland (the “Bankruptcy Court”).  The Company and one of its subsidiaries subsequently filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and amended, a plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) for the resolution of the outstanding claims against and interests pursuant to Section 1121(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (as amended and supplemented, the "Plan") and a related disclosure statement.  The Bankruptcy Court entered an order on June 12, 2017 confirming the Plan (the “Confirmation Order”) solely with respect to the Company, which provided that the effective date of the Plan will occur when all conditions precedent to effectiveness, as set forth in the Plan, have been satisfied or waived. Two of the conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were (i) the closing of the Company’s acquisition (the “HCS Acquisition”) of all of the capital stock of HCS and (ii) the restructuring of the Company’s then outstanding senior notes. The HCS Acquisition and the note restructuring were completed on July 27, 2017 and the Company filed a Notice of Occurrence of Effective Date of the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, holders of existing equity interests in the Company (i.e., the common stock) retained their interests.
 
On September 25, 2017, the bankruptcy case of 2114 Central, LLC was dismissed by order of the Bankruptcy Court. Thereafter, on December 22, 2017, NMLLC filed with the Bankruptcy Court a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, and on December 26, 2017 filed a related disclosure statement.  The Bankruptcy Court entered an order on February 16, 2018 approving the disclosure statement, as revised. On April 11, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed NMLLC's plan of reorganization.  This plan allows NMLLC to exit bankruptcy but prohibits the use of NMLLC assets for anything other than for the payment of NMLLC obligations. See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies for settlement information that was agreed to by NMLLC as part of its reorganization efforts. These obligations of approximately $1.5 million were reported on the Company's consolidated balance sheets for the year ended December 31, 2018. On April 19, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Motion for Final Decrees for Novation and NMLLC. On July 16, 2019, the bankruptcy case of NMFC was dismissed by order of the Bankruptcy Court.
  Note Refinancing and 2017 Notes. On August 9, 2019, the Company and Taberna Preferred Funding I, Ltd. ("Taberna I"), Taberna Preferred Funding II, Ltd. ("Taberna II") and Kodiak CDO I Ltd. ("Kodiak" and, together with Taberna I and Taberna II, the "Noteholders") executed a First Amendment to Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”) amending the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement (as defined below) and the 2017 Notes (as defined below) to, among other things, significantly reduce the interest rate applicable from January 2019 through the third quarter of 2028 and allow the Company to apply certain surplus interest payments against future quarterly interest payments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $85.9 million in aggregate borrowings outstanding under three senior secured promissory notes (the “2017 Notes”). The unpaid principal amounts of the 2017 Notes bear interest at the following rates until the maturity date on March 30, 2033, with interest payable quarterly in arrears as follows: 1% per annum from April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023; 2% per annum from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2028; and 10% per annum from January 1, 2029 through the maturity date. Commencing with the delivery to the Noteholders of the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, the Company is required to remit 50% of excess cash flow each year to the Noteholders to be applied as a principal reduction to the outstanding balance of the debt. The 2017 Notes generally rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future subordinated indebtedness of the Credit Parties (as defined below).  The Company may at any time upon 30 days’ notice to the Noteholders redeem all or part of the 2017 Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The 2017 Notes were entered into on July 27, 2017 as a result of a refinancing of the Company’s then outstanding senior notes with the same aggregate principal amount through the execution of the Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of the same date (as amended, the “Note Purchase Agreement”), with NHI and HCS as guarantors (together with the Company, collectively, the “Credit Parties”).
 
On April 1, 2019 and on July 1, 2019, the Company made payments under the 2017 Notes totaling $2.6 million. The actual aggregate amounts due for those dates totaled $0.4 million. Under the terms of the Amendment, the Company is permitted to apply the payment surplus of $2.2 million against future quarterly interest payments. Therefore, the Company will not have another quarterly interest payment due until April 1, 2022.

The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to certain financial covenants. Under the terms of the Amendment, the financial covenants have been waived until the quarter ending December 31, 2021. The Note Purchase Agreement also contains customary events of default, including but not limited to payment defaults, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, breaches of covenants and bankruptcy events. In the case of an event of default, the Noteholders may, among other remedies, accelerate the payment of all obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and the 2017 Notes. The Credit Parties entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of the same date, pursuant to which each of the Credit Parties granted a first priority lien generally covering all of its assets, other than accounts receivable and inventory, for the benefit of the Noteholders, to secure the obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and the 2017 Notes.
 
Under the terms of the Amendment, the Company issued to the Noteholders 9,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company and ten-year warrants allowing the Noteholders to purchase up to 22,250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. These warrants can be exercised at any time prior to expiration. See the Company’s discussion in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Amendment.
 
Business
 
Our business includes the operation of HCS and the management of our other investments, as described below.
 
HCS
 
Established in 1995, HCS is the largest outsourced healthcare services provider in the State of Georgia. HCS delivers outsourced full-time and part-time employees primarily to Community Service Boards (“CSB”).  HCS has long-term relationships with many of its customers and has been providing services to several clients for more than 15 years. A CSB is a quasi-state organization providing behavioral health services at facilities across Georgia including mental health services, developmental disabilities programs and substance abuse treatments. The State of Georgia has a total of 25 CSBs. Each CSB has a number of facilities, including crisis centers, outpatient centers and 24-hour group homes that require a broad range of employees, such as registered nurses, social workers, house parents and supervisors. The CSB market in Georgia is large and growing steadily, as the demand for the services provided by the CSB continues to grow. In addition to providing outsourced employees to CSB, HCS also provides healthcare outsourcing and staffing services to hospitals, schools, crisis units, clinics, doctors offices, prisons and a variety of privately owned businesses.  The services and positions provided to these clients are similar to the ones provided to CSB clients.
Other Investments
 
Prior to its acquisition of HCS, the Company originated, purchased, securitized, sold, invested in and serviced residential nonconforming mortgage loans and mortgage securities. As a result of those activities, we acquired mortgage securities that continued to be a source of our earnings and cash flow. Residual securities consisted of interest-only and overcollateralization bonds. Collectively, these securities are referred to as our "retained mortgage securities". The Company marketed these securities for sale and sold them during 2018 for a total of $13 million.
Strategy
 
The strategy of HCS is to continue expanding its market share in providing healthcare staffing services in Georgia and in particular serving Georgia CSBs. HCS is the dominant player in providing services to Georgia CSBs and plans to increase its market share of the CSB business. HCS will also continue to expand business to additional hospitals, private group homes, clinics, rest homes, prisons and retirement centers. Furthermore, the HCS strategy includes expanding clerical staff within existing customers, as well as gaining new clients. The longer-term strategy includes expansion beyond the Georgia market and may include acquisitions of staffing companies outside of Georgia, particularly in states that have public health infrastructure similar to that of Georgia.
 
We expect to use profits from HCS along with, potentially, other funding sources to acquire other businesses or make investments in the future.
 
Competition
 
HCS competes with numerous national staffing and recruiting businesses that specialize in the medical and healthcare industry, such as Nursefinders, Lighthouse Recruiting, Action Med and Brightstar. Other national staffing businesses have divisions that compete with HCS in Georgia, including ATC Healthcare, Kelly Services, Interim, Randstad and Maxim. Numerous Georgia non-national and smaller staffing providers also compete with HCS.
Regulation
 
The healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations related to, among other things, conduct of operations, and costs and payment for services. HCS is not directly regulated as a healthcare provider, although the customers of HCS are highly regulated. Therefore, HCS complies with many of the regulations prescribed for its customers.
 
HCS provides services directly to its clients on a contract basis and receives payment directly from them. However, many clients are reimbursed under the federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs for the services they provide. Therefore, HCS also may be affected indirectly by reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid.
 

 Employees


 As of March 17, 2020, the Company employed 1,227 full-time employees and 393 part-time employees. None of the Company's employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
