Overview and Industry Outlook
Both the market for drilling and production equipment and services and the Company’s business are substantially dependent on the condition of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations. The level of capital expenditures has generally been dependent upon the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas, including worldwide economic activity, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulation, tax policies and the ability and/or desire of OPEC and other producing nations to set and maintain production levels and prices. The Brent crude oil price reached a high of $115.19 per barrel in June 2014 and then began to drop sharply during the fourth quarter of 2014, ending the year at $55.27 per barrel. Crude oil prices continued to drop in 2015, reaching a low of $35.26 per barrel in December 2015. During the first quarter of 2016, the price per barrel reached a low of $26.01, before rebounding slightly to end the year at $54.96 per barrel. On November 30, 2016, OPEC met and decided to cut production by approximately 1.2 million barrels per day. The reduced production, if realized, is expected to keep oil prices over $50 per barrel during 2017. Capital expenditures are also dependent on the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas, the availability, expiration date and price of leases, the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves, technological advances and alternative opportunities to invest in onshore exploration and production operations. Oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and production activity have historically been characterized by significant volatility. Future declines in oil and gas prices may further adversely affect the willingness of some oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
Brent crude oil prices per barrel for the current and previous two years are summarized below:

 | Brent Crude Oil Prices
Year | Low | | High | | Average | | Dec. 31,
2014 | $ | 55.27 | | | $ | 115.19 | | $ | 98.97 | $ | 55.27
2015 | 35.26 | | | 66.33 | | | 52.32 | | 36.61
2016 | 26.01 | | | 54.96 | | | 43.67 | | 54.96

The decrease in Brent crude oil prices over the past three years continues to have a significant effect on major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies’ capital expenditure budgets. The Company expects continued volatility in both crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and gas may cancel or curtail programs, seek to renegotiate contract terms, including the price of products and services, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons. A continued significant and prolonged decline in hydrocarbon prices would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—A material or extended decline in expenditures by the oil and gas industry could significantly reduce our revenue and income.”
Recent Developments
On October 14, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Pearce Industries, Inc. to acquire all the outstanding common stock, par value $100.00 per share, of TIW Corporation for a cash purchase price of $142.7 million, which is subject to customary adjustments for cash and working capital. The acquisition closed on November 10, 2016. The acquisition of TIW 
6

is expected to strengthen the Company's liner hanger sales and increase market share. Additionally, the acquisition of TIW gives Dril-Quip a presence in the onshore oil and gas market.
Products and Services
Dril-Quip’s revenues are generated from two sources: products and services. Product revenues are derived primarily from the sale of offshore drilling and production equipment. Service revenues are earned when the Company provides technical advisory assistance and rental tools during installation and retrieval of the Company’s products. Additionally, the Company earns service revenues when rework and reconditioning services are provided. In 2016, the Company derived 80% of its revenues from the sale of its products and 20% of its revenues from services compared to 81% and 19% in 2015 and 83% and 17% in 2014, respectively.
Products
Dril-Quip designs, manufactures, fabricates, inspects, assembles, tests and markets subsea equipment, surface equipment and offshore rig equipment. The Company’s products are used primarily to explore for oil and gas from offshore drilling rigs, such as floating rigs and jack-up rigs, and for drilling and production of oil and gas wells on offshore platforms, tension leg platforms (TLPs), Spars and moored vessels such as FPSOs. TLPs are floating production platforms that are connected to the ocean floor via vertical mooring tethers. A Spar is a floating cylindrical structure approximately six or seven times longer than its diameter and is anchored in place. FPSOs are floating production, storage and offloading monohull moored vessels. The TIW products are used in the drilling and production for oil and gas both onshore and offshore.
Subsea Equipment. Subsea equipment is used in the drilling and production of offshore oil and gas wells around the world. Included in the subsea equipment product line are subsea wellheads, mudline hanger systems, specialty connectors and associated pipe, production riser systems, subsea production trees, liner hangers, safety valves, subsea control systems and subsea manifolds.
Subsea wellheads are pressure-containing vessels that are sometimes referred to as a “wellhead housing” and are made from forged and machined steel. A casing hanger, also made of steel, lands inside the wellhead housing and suspends casing (pipe) downhole. As drilling depth increases, successively smaller diameter casing strings are installed, each suspended by an independent casing hanger. Subsea wellheads are utilized when drilling from floating drilling rigs, either semi-submersible or drillship types, or TLPs and Spars. The Company’s flagship subsea wellhead, called the SS-15® Subsea Wellhead System, is rated for 15,000 psi internal pressure and is offered to the industry in a variety of configurations. The Company’s newest wellhead product, the SS-20TM BigBoreTM II-H Subsea Wellhead System, is designed to contain higher pressures (20,000 pounds per square inch (psi)) and accommodate additional casing strings installed through a marine drilling riser and a subsea blowout preventer.
Mudline hanger systems are used in jack-up drilling operations to support the weight of the various casing strings at the ocean floor while drilling a well. They also provide a method to disconnect the casing strings in an orderly manner at the ocean floor after the well has been drilled, and subsequently reconnect to enable production of the well by either tying it back vertically to a subsequently installed platform or by installing a shallow water subsea tree.
Large diameter weld-on specialty connectors (threaded or stab type) are used primarily in offshore wells drilled from floating drilling rigs, jack-up rigs, fixed platforms, TLPs and Spars. Specialty connectors join lengths of conductor or large diameter (16-inch or greater) casing. Specialty connectors provide a more rapid connection than other methods of connecting lengths of pipe. Connectors may be sold individually or as an assembly after being welded to sections of Company or customer supplied pipe. Dril-Quip’s weld-on specialty connectors are designed to prevent cross threading and provide a quick, convenient method of joining casing joints with structural integrity compatible with casing strength.
Production riser systems are generally designed and manufactured to customer specifications. Production risers provide a vertical conduit from the subsea wellhead up to a TLP, Spar or FPSO floating at the surface.
A subsea production tree is an assembly composed of valves, a wellhead connector, control equipment and various other components installed on a subsea wellhead or a mudline hanger system and used to control the flow of oil and gas from a producing well. Subsea trees may be used as stand alone satellite wells or multiple well template mounted and cluster arrangements. These types typically produce via a subsea gathering system of manifolds and flowlines to a central control point located on a platform, TLP, Spar or FPSO. The use of subsea production trees has become an increasingly important method for producing wells located in hard-to-reach deepwater areas or economically marginal fields located in shallower waters. The Company is an established manufacturer of complicated dual-bore production trees. In addition, Dril-Quip manufactures a patented single bore (SingleBoreTM) subsea completion system which features a hydraulic valve mechanism instead of a 
7

wireline-installed mechanism that allows the operator to plug the tubing hanger annulus remotely from the surface via a hydraulic control line and subsequently unplug it when the well is put on production. This mechanism eliminates the need for an expensive multibore installation and workover riser, thereby saving both cost and installation time. Dril-Quip’s subsea production trees are used in ultra-deepwater applications. These trees feature remote flowline and control connections, utilizing remotely operated intervention tools. The Company’s subsea production trees are generally custom designed and manufactured to customer specifications.
A liner hanger is used to hang-off and seal casing into a previously installed casing string in the well bore, and can provide a means of tying back the liner for production to surface. Dril-Quip has developed a state-of-the-art liner hanger system and has installed its liner hangers in a number of difficult well applications, resulting in improved industry recognition and market opportunities. In addition to liner hanger systems that are well suited for onshore use, TIW offers expandable liner hanger systems that are typically utilized in challenging environments such as deepwater or High Pressure, High Temperature (HPHT) applications.
A safety valve is used to provide a quick, sure shutoff in the drill string at the drill floor and prevent flow up the drill pipe. The TIW Kelly Valve is located in the drill string below the kelly, the uppermost component of the drill string, and is designed to be closed under pressure to remove the kelly. 
A subsea control system provides control of subsea trees, manifolds, ocean floor process equipment and pipeline protection equipment. Dril-Quip has developed a variety of subsea control systems, including fiber optic based multiplex control systems that provide real time access to tree functions and tree equipment status. The control system can be packaged for shallow water or deepwater applications. Dril-Quip also manufactures control systems used in the installation, retrieval and workover of production equipment.
A subsea manifold is a structure located on the ocean floor consisting of valves, flowline connections and a control module used to collect and control the flow of oil and gas from subsea wells for delivery to a floating production unit or terminal.
Surface Equipment. Surface equipment is principally used for flow control on offshore production platforms, TLPs and Spars. Included in the Company’s surface equipment product line are platform wellheads, platform production trees and riser tensioners. Dril-Quip’s development of platform wellheads and platform production trees was facilitated by adaptation of its existing subsea wellhead and tree technology to surface wellheads and trees.
Platform wellheads are pressure-containing forged and machined metal housings in which casing hangers are landed and sealed at the platform deck to suspend casings. The Company emphasizes the use of metal-to-metal sealing wellhead systems with operational time-saving features which can be used in high pressure, high temperature and corrosive drilling and production applications.
After installation of a wellhead, a platform production tree, consisting of gate valves, a surface wellhead connector, controls, tree cap and associated equipment, is installed on the wellhead to control and regulate oil or gas production. Platform production trees are similar to subsea production trees but utilize less complex equipment and more manual, rather than hydraulically actuated, valves and connectors. Platform wellheads and platform production trees and associated equipment are designed and manufactured in accordance with customer specifications.
Riser tensioners are used on a floating drilling/production vessel to provide a continuous and reliable upward force on a riser string that is independent of the movement of the floating vessel.
Offshore Rig Equipment. Offshore rig equipment includes drilling riser systems, wellhead connectors and diverters. The drilling riser system consists of (i) lengths of riser pipe and associated riser connectors that secure one to another; (ii) the telescopic joint, which connects the entire drilling riser system to the diverter at top of the riser at the rig and provides a means to compensate for vertical motion of the rig relative to the ocean floor; and (iii) the wellhead connector, which provides a means for remote connection and disconnection of the blowout preventer stack to or from the wellhead. Diverters are used to provide protection from shallow gas blowouts and to divert gases off of the rig during the drilling operation.
Wellhead connectors are used on production riser systems and drilling riser systems. They are also used on both TLPs and Spars, which are installed in deepwater applications. The principal markets for offshore rig equipment are new rigs, rig upgrades, TLPs and Spars. Drilling risers, wellhead connectors and diverters are generally designed and manufactured to customer specifications.

Certain products of the Company are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion and production applications that can cause personal injury, product liability and environmental claims. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business involves numerous operating hazards that may not be covered by insurance. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.”
Services
The Company provides services to customers, including technical advisory assistance and rental tools during installation and retrieval of the Company’s products. The Company also provides rework and reconditioning services on its customer-owned products. These services are provided from the Company’s worldwide locations and represented approximately 20% of revenues in 2016 compared to 19% in 2015 and 17% in 2014.
Technical Advisory Assistance. Dril-Quip does not install products for its customers, but it does provide technical advisory assistance to the customer, if requested, in the installation of its products. The customer is not obligated to utilize these services and may use its own personnel or a third party to perform these services. Technical advisory assistance services performed by the Company are negotiated and sold separately from the Company’s products. These services are not a prerequisite to the sale of the Company’s products as its products are fully functional on a stand alone basis. The Company’s technicians provide assistance in the onsite installation of the Company’s products and are available on a 24-hour call out from the Company’s facilities located in Houston, Texas; Midland, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Youngsville, Louisiana; New Orleans, Louisiana; Villahermosa, Mexico; Nisku, Alberta, Canada; Anaco, Venezuela; Shushufindi, Ecuador; Macae, Brazil; Aberdeen, Scotland; Szolnok, Hungary; Stavanger, Norway; Esbjerg, Denmark; Port Harcourt, Nigeria; Alexandria, Egypt; Takoradi, Ghana; Tianjin, China; Doha, Qatar; Singapore; and Perth, Australia.
Rental. The Company rents running and installation tools for use in installing its products. These tools are required to install and retrieve the Company’s products that are purchased by customers. Rental or purchase of running tools is not a condition of the sale of the Company’s products and is contracted for separately from product sales and other services offered by the Company. Running tools are available from Dril-Quip’s locations in Houston, Texas; Midland, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Youngsville, Louisiana; Villahermosa, Mexico; Nisku, Alberta, Canada; Anaco, Venezuela; Shushufindi, Ecuador; Macae, Brazil; Aberdeen, Scotland; Szolnok, Hungary; Stavanger, Norway; Esbjerg, Denmark; Beverwijk, Holland; Singapore; and Perth, Australia.
Reconditioning. The Company provides reconditioning of its customer-owned products at its facilities in Houston, Texas; Macae, Brazil; Aberdeen, Scotland; Stavanger, Norway; Esbjerg, Denmark; Port Harcourt, Nigeria; Alexandria, Egypt; Takoradi, Ghana; Balikpapan, Indonesia; Tianjin, China; Doha, Qatar; Singapore; and Perth, Australia. The Company does not typically service, repair or recondition its competitors’ products.
Manufacturing
Dril-Quip has major manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas; Aberdeen, Scotland; Singapore; and Macae, Brazil. See “Item 2. Properties—Manufacturing Facilities.” Only the Houston facility at Eldridge Parkway provides forged and heat treated products to its major manufacturing facilities. Dril-Quip maintains its high standards of product quality through the implementation of Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP) methodologies, as well as through the use of quality control specialists.
The Company’s Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore and Macae manufacturing plants are ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 9001 certified. The Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore and Macae plants are also licensed to applicable American Petroleum Institute (API) product specifications and are API Q1, 9th edition compliant. The Metallurgical Laboratory at the Houston operations is ISO 17025 certified for Crack Tip Opening Displacement, Hardness, Tensile and Charpy V-Notch testing. Dril-Quip works to maintain its high standards of product quality through the use of precision measuring equipment such as Gage Masters, Faro Arms, Coordinate Measuring Machine and the application of APQP. APQP entails concurrent engineering principles to identify and address potential quality concerns early in the product development process. The Company has the capability to manufacture various products from each of its product lines at its major manufacturing facilities and believes that this localized manufacturing capability is essential in order to compete with the Company’s major competitors.
The Company’s manufacturing processes are vertically integrated, providing capability for the majority of its forging and heat treating and essentially all of its machining, fabrication, inspection, assembly and testing to be performed in-house. The Company’s primary raw material is cast steel ingots, from which it produces steel shaped forgings at its forging and heat treatment facility in Houston, Texas. The Company routinely purchases steel ingots from multiple suppliers on a purchase order basis and does not have any long-term supply contracts. The Company’s Houston facility provides forgings and heat treatment for its Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore and Macae facilities. The Company’s major competitors depend on outside sources for all 
9

or a substantial portion of their forging and heat treatment requirements. The Company has made significant capital investments in developing its vertically integrated manufacturing capability. Prolonged periods of low demand in the market for drilling and production equipment could have a greater effect on the Company than on certain of its competitors that have not made such large capital investments in their facilities.
Dril-Quip’s manufacturing facilities utilize state-of-the-art computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools and equipment, which contribute to the Company’s product quality and timely delivery. The Company has also developed a cost effective, in-house machine tool rebuild capability which produces “like new” machine upgrades with customized features to enhance the economic manufacturing of its specialized products. The Company purchases quality used machine tools as they become available and stores them at its facilities to be rebuilt and upgraded as the need arises. Rebuilding used machine tools allows for greater customization suitable for manufacturing Dril-Quip proprietary product lines. This strategy provides the added advantage of in-house expertise for repairs and maintenance of these machines. A significant portion of the Company’s manufacturing capacity growth has been through the rebuild/upgrade of quality used machine tools, including the replacement of outdated control systems with state-of-the-art CNC controls.
Customers
The Company’s principal customers are major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies. Drilling contractors and engineering and construction companies also represent a portion of the Company’s customer base. The Company’s customers are generally oil and gas companies that are well-known participants in exploration and production.
The Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers. In 2016, the Company’s top 15 customers represented approximately 75% of total revenues, and Chevron and its affiliated companies accounted for approximately 16% of total revenues. In 2015 and 2014, the Company’s top 15 customers represented approximately 61% of total revenues, and Chevron and its affiliated companies accounted for approximately 12% and 10% of total revenues, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 or 2014. The number and variety of the Company’s products required in a given year by any one customer depends upon the amount of that customer’s capital expenditure budget devoted to exploration and production and on the results of competitive bids for major projects. Consequently, a customer that accounts for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in subsequent years. While the Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of its significant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.
Backlog
Backlog consists of firm customer orders of Dril-Quip products for which a purchase order or signed contract has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled. Historically, the Company’s revenues for a specific period have not been directly related to its backlog as stated at a particular point in time. The Company’s product backlog was approximately $318 million at December 31, 2016 and $685 million at December 31, 2015. The backlog at the end of 2016 represents a decrease of approximately $367 million, or 54%, from the end of 2015. The Company’s backlog balance during 2016 was negatively impacted by translation adjustments of approximately $1.3 million, due primarily to the weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, and by approximately $113 million in cancellations, of which $52 million was attributable to the cancellation of one contract during the first quarter of 2016 for wellhead equipment for a development project. In addition, the continued depressed hydrocarbon prices and resulting business environment has resulted in a significant decrease in new customer orders.
The Company expects to fill approximately 70% to 80% of the December 31, 2016 product backlog by December 31, 2017. The remaining backlog at December 31, 2016 consists of longer-term projects which are being designed and manufactured to customer specifications requiring longer lead times. In August 2012, the Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, Dril-Quip do Brasil LTDA, was awarded a four-year contract by Petrobras, Brazil’s national oil company. The contract was valued at $650 million, net of Brazilian taxes, at exchange rates in effect at that time (approximately $407 million based on the December 31, 2016 exchange rate of 3.26 Brazilian real to 1.00 U.S. dollar) if all the equipment under the contract was ordered. Amounts are included in the Company’s backlog as purchase orders under the contract are received. Revenues of approximately $129 million have been recognized on this contract through December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s backlog included $29 million of purchase orders under this Petrobras contract. The Company has not recognized revenue of approximately $11 million as of December 31, 2016 for certain items of equipment that were completed but not yet accepted for delivery by Petrobras. If Petrobras does not ultimately accept these items for delivery or if they refuse to accept these or similar items completed in the future, the Company’s results of operations may be adversely affected. Following an interim amendment to extend the term of the contract pending the resolution of discussions, the Company entered into an amendment on October 17, 2016 to extend the duration of the contract until July 2020. As part of the amendment to the contract, Petrobras agreed to issue purchase orders totaling a minimum of approximately $30 million (based on current 
10

exchange rates) before 2019. The Company cannot provide assurance that Petrobras will order all of the equipment under the contract. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future revenues and earnings.”
Marketing and Sales
Dril-Quip markets its products and services throughout the world directly through its sales personnel in multiple domestic and international locations. In addition, in certain foreign markets the Company utilizes independent sales agents or representatives to enhance its marketing and sales efforts.
Some of the locations in which Dril-Quip has sales agents or representatives are Trinidad, Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Although they do not have authority to contractually bind the Company, these representatives market the Company’s products in their respective territories in return for sales commissions. The Company advertises its products and services in trade and technical publications targeted to its customer base. The Company also participates in industry conferences and trade shows to enhance industry awareness of its products.
The Company’s customers generally order products on a purchase order basis. Orders, other than those considered to be long-term projects, are typically filled within twelve months after receipt, depending on the type of product and whether it is sold out of inventory or requires some customization. Contracts for certain of the Company’s larger, more complex products, such as subsea production trees, drilling risers and equipment for TLPs and Spars, can take a year or more to complete.
The primary factors influencing a customer’s decision to purchase the Company’s products are the quality, reliability and reputation of the product, price, technology, service and timely delivery. For large drilling and production system orders, project management teams coordinate customer needs with the Company’s engineering, manufacturing and service organizations, as well as with subcontractors and vendors.
A portion of the Company’s business consists of designing, manufacturing and selling equipment, as well as offering technical advisory assistance during installation of the equipment, for major projects pursuant to competitive bids. The number of such projects in any year may fluctuate. The Company’s profitability on such projects is critically dependent on making accurate and cost effective bids and performing efficiently in accordance with bid specifications. Various factors, including availability of raw materials, changes in customer requirements and governmental regulations, can adversely affect the Company’s performance on individual projects, with potential material adverse effects on project profitability.
Product Development and Engineering
The technological demands of the oil and gas industry continue to increase as exploration and drilling expand into more hostile environments. Conditions encountered in these environments include water depths in excess of 10,000 feet, well pressures exceeding 15,000 psi, well flowing temperatures beyond 350oF (Fahrenheit) and mixed flows of oil, gas and water that may also be highly corrosive and impact material properties.
Since its founding in 1981, Dril-Quip has actively engaged in continuing development efforts to generate new products and improve existing products. When developing new products, the Company typically seeks to design the most technologically advanced version for a particular application to establish its reputation and qualification in that product. Thereafter, the Company leverages its expertise in the more technologically advanced product to produce less costly and complex versions of the product for less demanding applications. The Company also focuses its activities on reducing the overall cost to the customer, which includes not only the initial capital cost but also operating, installation and maintenance costs associated with its products.
In the 1980s, the Company introduced its first product, specialty connectors, as well as mudline suspension systems, template systems and subsea wellheads. In the 1990s, the Company introduced a series of new products, including diverters, wellhead connectors, SingleBoreTM subsea trees, improved severe service dual bore subsea trees, subsea and platform valves, platform wellheads, platform trees, subsea tree workover riser systems, drilling riser systems and TLP and Spar production riser systems. Since 2000, Dril-Quip has introduced multiple new products, including liner hangers, subsea control systems, subsea manifolds and riser tensioners.
Historically, Dril-Quip’s product development work is primarily conducted at its facilities in Houston, Texas; however, such activities have gradually increased in other regions, such as Aberdeen, Singapore and Brazil. In addition to the work of its product development staff, the Company’s application engineering staff provides technical services to customers in connection with the design and sales of its products. The Company’s ability to develop new products and maintain technological 
11

advantages is important to its future success. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business could be adversely affected if we do not develop new products and secure and retain patents related to our products.”
The Company believes that the success of its business depends more on the technical competence, creativity and marketing abilities of its employees than on any individual patent, trademark or copyright. Nevertheless, as part of its ongoing product development and manufacturing activities, Dril-Quip’s policy has been to seek patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products and product improvements. All patent rights for products developed by employees are assigned to the Company and almost all of the Company’s products have components that are covered by patents.
In 2016, major production milestones were met for several key global projects. In the North Sea, seven subsea completion trees for a subsea field development project were successfully installed. Subsea trees previously delivered for a field development project off the coast of Trinidad were subsequently installed. Also, off the cost of Trinidad, multiple deepwater subsea wellhead systems were installed with the support of a service facility in Trinidad; this is Dril-Quip's first aftermarket support presence in the region. With the completion of engineering, manufacturing, assembly and testing of dry tree equipment, Dril-Quip was able to support the tieback of multiple wells for projects in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Malaysia. Engineering, manufacturing, assembly and test work continued on additional dry tree projects in the Company's backlog. The requirements of the equipment in these projects represent significant technological challenges, the development of which is serving to enhance the Company's overall engineering capabilities.
In an ongoing test program, the Company continued the utilization of its recently constructed high-load horizontal test machine and fatigue test machine for rigorous validation testing of its existing specialty connector product line. Active engineering programs have been initiated in-house to continue development in specialty connector product enhancements as well as new product development. Engineering development efforts are on-going in subsea production systems and capital equipment product lines.
In early 2016, the Company announced that it is establishing a research and development facility in Singapore that focuses on materials and products suitable for HPHT applications. The new facility, which is expected to open in late 2017, will serve as an additional hub for research and development activities for the Company.
Dril-Quip has numerous U.S. registered trademarks, including Dril-Quip®, Quik-Thread®, Quik-Stab®, Multi-Thread®, MS-15®, SS-15®, SS-10® and SU-90®. The Company has registered its trademarks in the countries where such registration is deemed material.
Although in the aggregate, the Company’s patents and trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacturing and marketing of many of its products, the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks to be material to its business as a whole, except the Dril-Quip® trademark. The Company also relies on trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information. The Company routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and suppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to the Company’s trade secrets.
Competition
Dril-Quip faces significant competition from other manufacturers and suppliers of exploration and production equipment. Several of its primary competitors are diversified multinational companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than those of the Company and which, in many instances, have been engaged in the manufacturing business for a much longer period of time than the Company. The Company competes principally with GE Oil and Gas (formerly Vetco Gray) and the petroleum production equipment segments of Schlumberger, Ltd., TechnipFMC plc and Aker Solutions.
Because of their relative size and diversity of products, several of the Company’s competitors have the ability to provide “turnkey” services for drilling and production applications, which enables them to use their own products to the exclusion of Dril-Quip’s products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We may be unable to successfully compete with other manufacturers of drilling and production equipment.” The Company also competes to a lesser extent with a number of other companies in various products. The principal competitive factors in the petroleum drilling and production equipment markets are quality, reliability and reputation of the product, price, technology, service and timely delivery.

Employees
As of December 31, 2015, the total number of the Company's employees was 2,319, of which 1,246 were located in the United States. The total number of the Company’s employees as of December 31, 2016 was 2,355, which includes the addition of 406 employees of TIW during the fourth quarter of 2016. Of these 2,355, 1,193 were located in the United States. As a result of additional worldwide reductions in force, the total number of employees as of February 24, 2017 was reduced to 2,179, an 7.5% reduction from December 31, 2016. In addition, reductions in pay have been instituted globally during the first quarter of 2017. Substantially all of the Company’s employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, and the Company considers its employee relations to be good. 
The Company’s operations depend in part on its ability to attract quality employees. While the Company believes that its wage and salary rates are competitive and that its relationship with its labor force is good, a significant increase in the wages and salaries paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of the Company’s labor force, increases in the wage and salary rates paid by the Company or both. If either of these events were to occur, in the near-term, the profits realized by the Company from work in progress would be reduced and, in the long-term, the production capacity and profitability of the Company could be diminished and the growth potential of the Company could be impaired. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Loss of our key management or other personnel could adversely impact our business.”
Governmental Regulations
Many aspects of the Company’s operations are affected by political developments and are subject to both domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including those relating to oilfield operations, the discharge of materials into the environment from our manufacturing or other facilities, health and worker safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection. In addition, the Company depends on the demand for its services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general, including those specifically directed to onshore and offshore operations. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic or other policy reasons could adversely affect the Company’s operations by limiting demand for the Company’s products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our operations and our customers’ operations are subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.”
In recent years, increased concern has been raised over the protection of the environment. Legislation to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases has been introduced, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the annual United Nations Climate Change Conferences. In November 2015, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) was held in Paris with the objective to achieve a legally binding and universal agreement on climate, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2o C (Celsius), from all nations, regardless of size. The Paris Agreement, signed by the U.S. on April 22, 2016, requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, every five years. In November 2014, the United States and China agreed to new targets for carbon emissions reductions. Also, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has undertaken efforts to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions and their effects. Following a finding by the EPA that certain greenhouse gases represent a danger to human health, the EPA has expanded its regulations relating to those emissions and has adopted rules imposing permitting and reporting obligations. The results of the permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of these greenhouse gases by the EPA. Moreover, specific design and operational standards apply to U.S. outer continental shelf vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles, structures and equipment. 
The U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) regulates the design and operation of well control and other equipment at offshore production sites, among other requirements. BSEE has adopted stricter requirements for subsea drilling production equipment. In April 2016, BSEE published a final blowout preventer systems and well control rule, which focuses on blowout preventer requirements and includes reforms in well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring and subsea containment, among other things. In addition, drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. For example, in December 2016, the Obama administration banned offshore drilling in portions of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. To the extent that new laws or other governmental actions prohibit or restrict drilling or impose additional environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the drilling industry in particular, the business of the Company could be adversely affected. The Company cannot determine to what extent its future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business and our customers’ businesses are 
13

subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.”
Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations related to workplace safety and worker health, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Based on the Company’s experience to date, the Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its business or consolidated financial position as a result of future compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of or by regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by the Company, which may be material.
