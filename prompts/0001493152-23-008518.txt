Market Opportunity
 
The Company’s core revenue generators are uniquely positioned in the sport and education space. The founders of Altitude have a long history in blending the benefits of sports, education, hospitality, and real estate development to create their own sustainable integrated marketplace. The global Rush Soccer relationship adds to and complements this strategy. With the Rush transaction, the Company consolidated 142 clubs and more than 47,000 soccer players in the United States alone, positioning the Company for significant growth through multiple levels of programming offerings to the Rush constituents. Altitude has the opportunity to increase the Rush membership fee per player and as a result positively impact the average $800 club fee currently being generated by approximately 300 average paying members per club. In addition, Altitude expected to onboard approximately 90 additional clubs to the Rush platform.
 
Altitude’s current destination full-time and weekly tuition operations are recognized among the top international sports academies in the world. Its current location on 238 acres with more than 3,000 feet of waterfront in Port Saint Lucie, Florida, makes Altitude an attractive academy destination globally.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Altitude is focused on continued increase in volume and capture rate in its core tennis, golf, soccer, and volleyball tuition operations. The Company hopes to be able to add additional categories of tuition programming like basketball, lacrosse, etc. in the coming years.
 
The addition of Altitude Online will allow for growth in our academic component with our distance learning offering to our customers. Through the acquisition of Rush Soccer, Altitude will implement added programs on the full-time, weekly, tournament, and regional soccer schools and transaction fees and member dues with growth.

Our AWGs range from smaller residential, light commercial, and heavy-duty military-grade machines. The machines supply up to 12, 100, and 200 gallons of water per day and cost approximately $4,000 to $75,000 per unit.
Our Competitive Strengths
 
AWGs extract water from humid ambient air and render it potable, making it safe for drinking. Altitude Water uses its patented process to distinguish itself from the competition by not only providing potable water but adds the element of providing oxygenated water. Altitude Water can provide the benefits of oxygenated water. It allows for better absorption for the body’s cells based on osmosis through a sustainable product that can make water even in areas where it may not always be readily available. Thus, Altitude Water operates within the pure water generation industry as well as the oxygenated water industry, carving out a unique niche product market for customers. The competitive advantage of Altitude Water’s patented ozone purification process is that it keeps the water and the system free from contaminants. Altitude Water’s process is also green, sustainable, and lowers the carbon footprint. Altitude Water offers several levels of its AWGs at various price points, enabling it to target a larger variety of potential customers.
Competition
 
In our water purification segment, we face competition from other companies, such as Genaq, Watergen USA, SunToWater Technologies, and Synergy Science. The Company believes that there is a high barrier for entry and will require capital. The Company believes it can compete with these other companies due to the experience of our team and the EnviroGuard™ utility patented process introducing ozone into the water cycle. This patented process sets the Company apart from its competitors.
Marketing and Customers
 
Altitude Water targets consumers who have a need for pure drinking water and do not want to rely on bottled water due to storage problems and environmental issues with plastic bottles. The market for the smaller Trident 12 model is residential and offices that have the traditional 5-gallon dispenser with bottled water. For the commercial units (T-100 and T-200), the customers need to overcome supply chain and logistical issues to have a reliable source of pure drinking water such as the United States Armed Forces and humanitarian relief organizations. The patented process within the AWGs appeals to forward-thinking, environmentally conscious clients, due to the purity of the water as well as the ability for ozonated water to cleanse bacteria from the tubing that traditional methods such as UV lights and reverse osmosis filtration are unable to address.

Altitude Chambers: Climate-Controlled Rooms
 
Altitude Chambers specializes in creating uniquely engineered, membrane-based designs for simulated altitude training environments. Altitude Chambers entered into an exclusive, perpetual licensing agreement with Sporting Edge UK Ltd., Inc. (“Sporting Edge UK”), a UK company, which granted Altitude International, Inc. a license and access to Sporting Edge’s intellectual property and proprietary technology related to properly engineered, membrane-based designs for simulated altitude training equipment. The product line ranges from personal at-home use machines to fully integrated environmental rooms and chambers. Altitude has the licensing rights to use all technology to manufacture the products and to sell them (directly or through distributors) in North, Central, and South America. The manufacturing of the environmental rooms and chambers takes place in the United States.

There are three unique elements to our systems:
 

● | Sophisticated touch screen control systems capable of integrating the control of simulated altitude, temperature and humidity. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A unique design of air separation unit with only a single active part that provides for ultra-reliable operation and a design life of greater than fifteen years. 
● | Proven training protocols that allow the desired training benefits to be achieved. 

 
The impact of COVID-19 stalled most sports activities, including closures and no season, for much of 2020 and 2021. However, in recent months, the Company has experienced a renewed interest in the university, college, military, and therapy sectors and professional sports teams.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the industry operating environment is ready for our simulated altitude training environments. The blended business approach that Altitude has adopted has substantiated our climate-controlled rooms in the marketplace through education and applied use of our systems and protocols. In the academies’ operations alone, participants attend from 40 nations around the world. Professional athletes and professional teams utilize the facilities from Europe, South America, and Asia.
Competition
 
Currently, membrane-based technology is not being well used in the United States. In North America, there exist some companies that provide altitude training masks, but the equipment is on a much smaller scale, intended for personal use. This type of equipment employs PSA technology, which has reliability issues and a restricted altitude capacity. There have been recent climate-controlled chamber successes in therapy and rehab environments. While used in the United States and North America, much of the membrane-based technology reflects continued use on a more personal basis. Our competitors include companies such as Ace Cleaning Systems and ClarityFresh.
Marketing and Customers
 
We plan to market to franchise, college, military and therapy institutions interested in installing climate-controlled chambers in their performance facilities. Our outreach utilizes far-reaching relational capital as the point of entry for prospective targets. Our products and services support junior, adult, and professional individuals.
 
Altitude’s second demonstration facility to be installed and used at Altitude Academies will serve as headquarters.
 
Our Wellness Offerings
 
Altitude Wellness will focus on helping its future members reach their individual health goals by offering various experiences that enhance the way members look and feel. Multiple modalities ranging from altitude chambers, cryo chambers, ozone chamber, red light therapy, IV therapy, infrared sauna, and neuro feedback are just a few of the treatments that will be available.
 
The highly trained staff will include nurses, dietitians, trainers, therapists, and health specialists. Each will know the patient by name and be familiar with their profile, which will be completed on the Altitude App and available to the experience specialists upon each check-in. As of December 31, 2022, Altitude Wellness was not operating but projects being in operation in late 2023 or 2024.
 
Altitude Wellness’s business intends to operate in 3 different revenue streams:
 

1. | Membership: 300-400 members paying a monthly fee of $350 per person on average. With a firm commitment to a limited number of members, this will cause a sense of urgency and create a fear of missing out. This membership model and token-based platform is different from any other franchise on the market today. It will allow the franchise owner to know their minimum monthly revenue and budget expenses accordingly. The projections also call out for additional spending of members over and above the monthly membership cost. Corporate and group discounts of 5 or more will also help dramatically in the sales of memberships.

2. | Private Pay, Medical Pay and Corporate: This will include walk in business and daily rental of entire facility to corporations for their staff. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Franchise: Altitude Wellness will franchise the concept to other locations around the country. A franchise company is currently engaged for proper set up and lead generation. Altitude Wellness franchise fee will be $40,000 plus 5% of gross plus an additional advertising fee. All fees and costs as well as scheduling of equipment will be coordinated through the Altitude App, which will hold the franchisee accountable for proper fees.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
One of the largest burdens our competitors carry are their build-out burden costs. To combat this, Altitude Wellness will use existing medical centers, such as our first location projected for 2022 in Sugar Land, Texas, in the range of 4,000+ square feet with approximately 10 separate offices. For the Sugar Land, Texas location, a lease is utilized. Future expansion will be dependent on the location and the situation. This will dramatically reduce costs for build out and execution. For location and start up projections, we used traditional averages of build out and office equipment. The executive team will use their relationships, construction knowledge, design expertise and smart buying power to make sure costs are held to a minimum with an outstanding product for the best pricing on look and all the equipment.
 
The value of using existing medical offices is that many are available due to the shift in demand for in-house patient contact. Parking is traditionally sufficient, locations are typically excellent, and the power and access for equipment lend itself for a perfect Altitude franchise. Target timing will be 90 days from lease signing to open for business.
 
Competition
 
In our wellness revenue stream, we face competition from companies such as The Drip Bar, Three Degrees Infrared Light Therapy, Chill Rx Cryotherapy, and Stretch Zone, to name a few. Restore Hyper Wellness is the industry leader with similar modalities, and their expansion and growth are impressive. The Restore plan is to have over 500 franchises by 2024. With over $200 billion a year spent in wellness related procedures; this industry is ready for a new leader. Altitude Wellness will be positioned to be the new leader and disrupter to the wellness industry – shifting how we approach wellness from reactive to proactive.
Marketing and Customers
 
Altitude Wellness unique membership program allows for flexibility in outreach and awareness. By developing a marketing program focusing on influencers and celebrity types, we intend to achieve low-cost marketing and target members of like-minded individuals. Each outreach membership will vary between the Silver, Gold, and Platinum membership, based on the success of the personality. Altitude will also have the ability to donate monthly memberships to many local organizations. Marketing and advertising will be done on a very specific target and demographic of the area. Through Instagram and Facebook advertisements, a local campaign per location will be established. Altitude Wellness will also use local advertising, influencers, celebrities as well as chamber lists and relationships with corporations to secure memberships. Altitude Wellness intends to utilize the wellness center for “renting” to local businesses for their employees, in blocks of time. The wellness center will also be “donated” to people in the community such as first responders, schoolteachers, victims of domestic violence and other organizations within the community to help “heal” people who may not have the means and resources to utilize our facility.
