Item 1.     Business.
Our Company
          We are a Midland, Texas‑based oilfield services company providing hydraulic fracturing and other complementary services to leading upstream oil and gas companies engaged in the exploration and production (“E&P”) of North American unconventional oil and natural gas resources. Our operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin, where we have cultivated longstanding customer relationships with some of the region’s most active and well‑capitalized E&P companies. The Permian Basin is widely regarded as one of the most prolific oil‑producing areas in the United States, and we believe we are one of the leading providers of hydraulic fracturing services in the region by hydraulic horsepower (“HHP”). 
          Changes to our customers’ well design, shale formations, operating conditions and new technology have resulted in continuous changes to the number of pumps that constitute a fleet. As a result of the asymmetric nature of the number of pumps that constitute a fleet across our customer base and competitors, which we believe will continue to evolve, we view HHP to be an appropriate metric to measure our available hydraulic fracturing capacity. Our total available HHP at December 31, 2020 was 1,373,000 HHP (excluding approximately 150,000 HHP we are in the process of permanently retiring), which was comprised of 1,265,000 HHP of conventional Tier II equipment and 108,000 HHP of our new DuraStim® electric powered hydraulic fracturing equipment. In addition, we have committed to purchase 50,000 HHP of Tier IV Dynamic Gas Blending (“DGB”) dual fuel equipment, that is expected to be delivered before the end of the first half of 2021. Our Tier IV DGB equipment could be powered by either diesel or natural gas, an improvement from Tier II conventional equipment that can only be powered with diesel. With the industry transition to lower emissions equipment and changes to the number of pumps or HHP that constitute a fleet, we believe that our available fleet capacity could decline as we reconfigure our fleets to increase active HHP and backup HHP based on our customers’ operational needs or as we retire and replace conventional Tier II equipment. In light of the energy industry transition to lower emissions equipment, the Company made a strategic decision to permanently retire approximately 150,000 HHP of its existing conventional Tier II pressure pumping equipment.
          In 2019, we entered into a purchase commitment for 108,000 HHP DuraStim® electric powered hydraulic fracturing equipment. Our DuraStim® equipment is still being tested and has only been deployed to our customers’ wellsites on a limited scale. As we continue with our testing of the equipment, the number of DuraStim® pumps that constitute a fleet will depend on a combination of factors, including the ultimate operating performance of DuraStim® pumps following the completion of testing, the particular shale formation where a well is completed, customer service requirements and job design. The Company has set a goal to commercialize its first DuraStim® fleet to our customer wellsites in the second half of 2021. We also have an option to purchase up to an additional 108,000 HHP of DuraStim® hydraulic fracturing equipment in the future through July 31, 2022. We currently have gas turbines to provide electrical power to our DuraStim® fleet. The electrical power sources for future DuraStim® fleets are still being evaluated and could either be supplied by the Company, customers or a third-party supplier. 
          All of our hydraulic fracturing fleets have been designed to handle the most challenging Permian Basin operating conditions and the region’s increasingly high‑intensity well completions, which are characterized by longer horizontal wellbores, more fractured stages, increased number of wells per pad and increasing amounts of proppant per well.
          In addition to our core pressure pumping segment operations, which consist of our hydraulic fracturing and cementing operations, we also offer a suite of complementary well completion and production services, including coiled tubing and other services. We believe these complementary services create operational efficiencies for our customers and could allow us to capture a greater portion of their capital spending across the lifecycle of a well.
Commodity Price and Other Economic Conditions
          The global public health crisis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has and is anticipated to continue to have an adverse effect on global economic activity for the immediate future and has resulted in travel restrictions, business closures and the institution of quarantining and other restrictions on movement in many communities. The slowdown in global economic activity attributable to COVID-19 has resulted in a dramatic decline in the demand for energy which directly impacts our industry and the Company. In addition, global crude oil prices experienced a collapse starting in early March 2020 as a direct result of failed negotiations between OPEC and Russia.
          As the breadth of the COVID-19 health crisis expanded throughout the month of March 2020 and governmental 
1


authorities implemented more restrictive measures to limit person-to-person contact, global economic activity continued to decline commensurately. The associated impact on the energy industry has been adverse and continued to be exacerbated by the depressed demand in the energy sector and uncertainty in global production levels. In response to the global economic slowdown and depressed demand in the oil and gas industry, OPEC+ has made adjustments to production levels with the objective of rebalancing the energy market. After the March 2020 failed negotiations, OPEC+ subsequently agreed to cut production by 7.7 million barrels of oil per day, or BOPD. In January 2021, OPEC+ reconvened to discuss the matter of production cuts in light of unprecedented disruption and supply and demand imbalances. Agreements were reached to gradually increase production by 0.5 million BOPD, starting in January 2021, and adjusting the production reduction from 7.7 million BOPD to 7.2 million BOPD. OPEC+ members have shown compliance with previously agreed upon production levels, and we have seen recovery in crude oil prices from its low point in 2020.
          The combined effect of COVID-19 and the energy industry disruptions led to a decline in West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil prices of approximately 67 percent from the beginning of January 2020, when prices were approximately $62 per barrel, through the end of March 2020, when they were just above $20 per barrel. Overall, with OPEC+ managing production levels and with the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, there has been gradual recovery in crude oil prices from the low point in March 2020. As of March 3, 2021, the WTI price for a barrel of crude oil was approximately $62, a significant increase from its low point in 2020. However, with the uncertainty in the global market resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk that currently developed vaccines may not be successful in preventing the COVID-19 virus or the outbreak of a new virus, the global demand for crude oil could continue to be depressed and crude oil prices could decline.
          In order to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and the economic effects of the unprecedented decline in economic activity and global energy markets, we undertook several actions since March 2020 in support of the efficient continuity of our operations. These actions are described in greater detail in Part 2, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Our Services
          We have historically conducted our business through five operating segments: hydraulic fracturing, cementing, coiled tubing, flowback and drilling. For reporting purposes, the hydraulic fracturing and cementing operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment—pressure pumping. Our coiled tubing, flowback, and drilling operating segments and corporate administrative expense are aggregated into our “All Other” reportable segment. For additional financial information on our reportable segment, please see reportable segment information in Part II - Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Pressure Pumping
Hydraulic Fracturing
          We primarily provide hydraulic fracturing services to E&P companies in the Permian Basin. These services are intended to optimize hydrocarbon flow paths during the completion phase of horizontal shale wellbores. We have significant expertise in multi‑stage fracturing of horizontal oil‑producing wells in unconventional geological formations. Our total available HHP at December 31, 2020 was 1,373,000 HHP (excluding approximately 150,000 HHP we are in the process of permanently retiring), which was comprised of 1,265,000 HHP of conventional Tier II equipment and 108,000 HHP of our new DuraStim® hydraulic fracturing equipment. Our DuraStim® hydraulic fracturing equipment has been tested on a limited scale basis with certain of our customers. The Company has set a goal to commercialize its first DuraStim® fleet to our customers’ wellsites in the second half of 2021.
          The fracturing process consists of pumping a fracturing fluid into a well at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation. Materials known as proppants, which in our business are comprised primarily of sand, are suspended in the fracturing fluid and are pumped into the fracture to prop it open. The fracturing fluid is designed to “break,” or loosen viscosity, and be forced out of the formation by its pressure, leaving the proppants suspended in the fractures created, thereby increasing the mobility of the hydrocarbons. As a result of the fracturing process, production rates are usually enhanced substantially, thus increasing the rate of return of hydrocarbons for the operator.
          We own and operate a fleet of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary equipment to perform fracturing services. We also refer to all of our fracturing units, other equipment and vehicles necessary to perform a fracturing job as a “fleet” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew.” On average, one conventional Tier II hydraulic fracturing 
2 


fleet consists of approximately 50,000 HHP, depending on job design and customer demand. Our conventional Tier II hydraulic fracturing units consist primarily of a high pressure hydraulic pump, diesel engine, transmission and various hoses, valves, tanks and other supporting equipment like blenders, irons and datavans. Our DuraStim® hydraulic fracturing fleet can be powered by turbines, generators or similar equipment that could generate electricity. 
          We provide dedicated equipment, personnel and services that are tailored to meet each of our customer’s needs. Each fleet has a designated team of personnel, which allows us to provide responsive and customized services, such as project design, proppant and other consumables procurement, real‑time data provision and post‑completion analysis for each of our jobs. Many of our hydraulic fracturing fleets and associated personnel have worked continuously with the same customer for the past several years promoting deep relationships and a high degree of coordination and visibility into future customer activity levels. Furthermore, in light of our substantial market presence and historically high fleet utilization levels, we have established a variety of trusted relationships with key equipment, sand and other downhole consumable suppliers. These strategic relationships ensure ready access to equipment, parts and materials on a timely and economic basis and allow our dedicated procurement and logistics team to ensure consistently safe and reliable operations.
Cementing
          We provide cementing services for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells. Cementing services use pressure pumping equipment to deliver a slurry of liquid cement that is pumped down a well between the casing and the borehole. Cementing provides isolation between fluid zones behind the casing to minimize potential damage to hydrocarbon bearing formations or the integrity of freshwater aquifers, and provides structural integrity for the casing by securing it to the earth. Cementing is also done when re-completing wells, where one zone is plugged and another is opened.
        We believe that our cementing segment provides an organic growth opportunity for us to expand our service offerings within our existing customer base.
Other Services
Coiled Tubing
          Coiled tubing services involve injecting coiled tubing into wells to perform various completion well intervention operations. Coiled tubing is a flexible steel pipe with a diameter of typically less than three inches and manufactured in continuous lengths of thousands of feet. It is wound or coiled on a truck‑mounted reel for onshore applications. Due to its small diameter, coiled tubing can be inserted into existing production tubing and used to perform a variety of services (including drillout of plugs) to enhance the flow of oil or natural gas.
          The principal advantages of using coiled tubing include the ability to (i) continue production from the well without interruption, thus reducing the risk of formation damage, (ii) move continuous coiled tubing in and out of a well significantly faster than conventional pipe used with a workover rig, which must be jointed and unjointed, (iii) direct fluids into a wellbore with more precision, allowing for improved stimulation fluid placement, (iv) provide a source of energy to power a downhole motor or manipulate downhole tools and (v) enhance access to remote fields due to the smaller size and mobility.
Flowback Services
          Our flowback services consisted of production testing, solids control and hydrostatic testing. Flowback involves the process of allowing fluids to flow from the well following a treatment, either in preparation for an impending phase of treatment or to return the well to production. Our flowback equipment consisted of manifolds, accumulators, valves, flare stacks and other associated equipment that combine to form up to a total of five well‑testing spreads. Historically, we provided flowback services in the Permian Basin and Mid‑Continent markets. In March 2020, the Company shut down its flowback operations and disposed of all the assets.
Drilling
Our vertical drilling assets in our drilling segment have been idled since 2016, and in September 2020, the Company shut down its drilling operations and disposed of all of its drilling rigs and ancillary assets.

Our Customers
          Our customers consist primarily of oil and natural gas producers in North America. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 86.5%, 77.1% and 68.7% of our revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Pioneer Natural Resources USA Inc. (“Pioneer”) and XTO Energy Inc. accounted for 42.5% and 20.3%, respectively, of total revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Competition
          The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, an oilfield services company must provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas E&P companies at competitive prices. Competitive factors impacting sales of our services are price, reputation, technical expertise, emissions profile, service and equipment design and quality, and health and safety standards. Although we believe our customers consider all of these factors, we believe price is a key factor in E&P companies’ criteria in choosing a service provider. However, we have recently observed the energy industry and our customers shift to lower emissions equipment, which we believe will be an increasingly important factor in an E&P company’s selection of a service provider. While we seek to price our services competitively, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on our operational efficiencies, productivity, equipment quality, commitment to safety and the ability of our people to handle the most complex Permian Basin well completions.
          We provide our services primarily in the Permian Basin, and we compete against different companies in each service and product line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies. Our major competitors for hydraulic fracturing services include Halliburton Company, Liberty Oilfield Services Inc., Nextier Oilfield Solutions Inc., Patterson‑UTI Energy Inc., RPC, Inc., and FTS International, Inc. and a number of private and locally-oriented businesses.
Seasonality
          Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies, generally in the fourth quarter, relating to the conclusion of our customers’ annual capital expenditure budgets, the holidays and inclement winter weather during which we may experience declines in our operating results.
Operating Risks and Insurance
          Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oilfield services industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires and spills and releases that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage or destruction of property, equipment, natural resources and the environment and suspension of operations.
          In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.
          Our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, and as a result, we may also experience traffic accidents which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury.
          Despite our efforts to maintain safety standards, we have suffered accidents from time to time in the past and anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property damage, personal injury and other losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability and our relationships with customers, employees, regulatory agencies and other parties. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
          We maintain commercial general liability, workers’ compensation, business automobile, commercial property, umbrella liability, excess liability, and directors and officers insurance policies providing coverages of risks and amounts that we believe to be customary in our industry. Further, we have pollution legal liability coverage for our business entities, which would cover, among other things, third party liability and costs of clean up relating to environmental contamination on our premises while our equipment is in transit and on our customers’ job site. With respect to our 
4 


hydraulic fracturing operations, coverage would be available under our pollution legal liability policy for any surface or subsurface environmental clean‑up and liability to third parties arising from any surface or subsurface contamination. We also have certain specific coverages for some of our businesses, including our hydraulic fracturing services.
          We maintain director and officer insurance; however, our insurance coverage is subject to certain exclusions (including, for example, any required SEC disgorgement or penalties) and we are responsible for meeting certain deductibles under the policies. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us from claims made in the Logan Lawsuit, the Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, the SEC investigation or any future claims.
          Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on us. See “Risk Factors” for a description of certain risks associated with our insurance policies.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
          Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that could carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may, for example, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas, or require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position. For example, following the election of President Biden and Democratic control in both houses of Congress, it is possible that our operations may be subject to greater environmental, health and safety restrictions, particularly with regards to hydraulic fracturing, permitting and greenhouse gases (“GHG”) emissions. We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with current requirements; however, this trend may not continue in the future.
          Below is an overview of some of the more significant environmental, health and safety requirements with which we must comply. Our customers’ operations are subject to similar laws and regulations. Any material adverse effect of these laws and regulations on our customers’ operations and financial position may also have an indirect material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
          Waste Handling. We handle, transport, store and dispose of wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws and regulations, which affect our activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although certain petroleum production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non-hazardous waste provisions.
          Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Moreover, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or recategorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes. Several environmental organizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous. Any such changes in these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.

          Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes or contamination, damages to natural resources, the costs of conducting certain health studies, amongst other things, is strict and joint and several. In the course of our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state laws. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been released.
          NORM. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) associated with oil and gas deposits and, accordingly, may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. NORM exhibiting levels of radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements.
          Water Discharges. The Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. Also, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters.
          Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other emissions control requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants from specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. These and other laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities where we operate. Obtaining or renewing permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
          Climate Change. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of certain pollutant from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the Department of Transportation ("DOT"), implementing GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified, or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission, and storage activities, otherwise known as Subpart OOOOa. The EPA finalized amendments to the 2016 standards in September 2020 that removed the transmission and storage segment from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. However, several lawsuits have been filed challenging these amendments, and President Biden has called for the issuance of regulations that would suspend, revise or rescind the September 2020 rule and the introduction of new or more stringent emissions standards for new, modified and existing oil and gas facilities.
          Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas such as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there is an agreement, the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” that requires nations to submit non-binding emissions reduction targets every five years after 2020. Although the United States had previously withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden has signed executive orders on his first day in office recommitting the United States to the agreement and calling for the federal government to begin formulating the United States’ nationally determined emissions reduction targets under the agreement. However, the impacts of these executive orders, and the terms of any legislation or regulation to implement the United States’ commitment under the Paris Agreement, are unclear at this time. 
6 


          Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate-change-related pledges made by certain candidates for public office. On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry and an increased emphasis on climate-related risk across government agencies and economic sectors. The executive order also suspends the issuance of new leases for oil and gas development on federal land; for more information, see our regulatory disclosure titled “Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Related Activities.” Other actions that the Biden Administration may take include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the development of pipeline infrastructure or liquefied natural gas export facilities or more restrictive GHG emissions limitations for oil and gas facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court, alleging among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or that such companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change but failed to adequately disclose those impacts to their investors or customers.
          The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for our services and products.
          Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.
          Endangered and Threatened Species. Environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state laws may impact exploration, development and production activities in areas where we operate. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and various state analogs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) may identify previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. For example, the dunes sagebrush lizard, which is found only in the active and semi-stable shinnery oak dunes of southeastern New Mexico and adjacent portions of Texas (including areas where our customers operate), was a candidate species for listing under the ESA by the FWS for many years. As a result of a recent settlement with the environmental groups, the FWS, in July 2020, acted on a petition to list the dunes sagebrush lizard finding sufficient information to warrant a formal one-year review to consider listing the species. While the listing review is ongoing, FWS has also solicited comments on a proposed conservation agreement that would implement certain protective practices for the species and authorize incidental take of the species resulting from certain covered activities, including exploration and development of oil and gas fields. However, to the extent any protections are implemented for this or any other species, it could cause us or our customers to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or operating bans in the affected areas.
          Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Related Activities. Our hydraulic fracturing operations are a significant component of our business. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has previously issued a series of rules under the CAA that establish new emission control requirements for certain oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations and associated equipment. Separately, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) previously finalized a rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, but in June 2016, a federal district court judge in Wyoming struck down the final rule, finding that the BLM lacked congressional authority to promulgate the rule. While this ruling was initially challenged, in December 2017, the BLM published a rulemaking to rescind the final rule and reinstate the regulations that existed immediately before the published effective date of the rule. Although several of these rulemakings have been rescinded or modified, new or more stringent regulations may be promulgated by the Biden administration. For example, on January 20, the Biden Administration’s Department of the Interior (“DOI”) issued an order that temporarily suspended the issuance of any fossil fuel authorizations, including leases and permits, for a period of 60 days, and President Biden subsequently issued a longer suspension on the issuance of new oil and gas leases on federal land, pending a review of current practices. Although the orders do not limit existing operations under valid leases, any restrictions for new or existing production activities on federal land could adversely impact our customers’ operations, and consequently demand for our services. Further, legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the 
7 


exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have previously been proposed in Congress. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
          Federal and state governments have also investigated whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma has issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that impose permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, has implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. In particular, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the SCOOP and STACK require hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity. In addition, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division has previously issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected into the ground in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state. The Texas Railroad Commission has adopted similar rules.
          Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and related activities could subject us and our customers to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and record keeping obligations, and plugging and abandonment requirements. New requirements could result in increased operational costs for us and our customers, and reduce the demand for our services.
          OSHA Matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
Human Capital
          Our employees are our key asset. Our primary human capital management objectives are to effectively engage, develop, retain and reward our employees. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,100 people, none of which are unionized. Of the total population over 80% of our headcount worked for our pressure pumping segment. Our employees are a key component of our ability to attract and retain customers as a result of their operational excellence in the field.
         Some examples of significant programs and initiatives that are focused to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:
•Diversity and inclusion. We believe that in order to attract and retain talent with the skill sets and expertise required to maximize our operational efficiencies across all levels in the Company, it is in our best interest to attempt to recruit and develop a diverse team and create a culture that is inclusive and provides equal opportunities for hiring and advancement for all employees and prospective employees. Some examples of this effort include;
◦a commitment to conducting business in a manner that respects all human rights in compliance within the requirements of applicable laws;
◦efforts to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinctions of any kind such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinions;
◦working in partnership with personnel, business parties and other parties directly linked to our operations that share our commitment to these same principles;
◦efforts in our employment practices, including through our code of conduct, our equal employment opportunity employer policy, and our anti-harassment policy; and

◦to make it possible for grievances regarding health and safety to be addressed early and remediated directly, in confidence and without fear of retaliation; the Company provides an anonymous whistleblower hotline that is promoted internally and accessible from our intranet and internet.
•Training and Safety.  We offer in-depth, role-appropriate safety training upon hiring and as part of the continuous development of our employees. The safety of our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate is paramount. We track and evaluate safety incidents at wellsites and offices, and if an accident does occur, we take actions to mitigate similar incidents from reoccurring in the future. The Company incentivizes employees to focus on conducting operations in accordance with our strict safety standards and encourages employees to immediately report any breach of safety protocol. Twenty percent of our executive officers’ annual target bonuses under the 2020 annual incentive program were based upon the Company’s achievement of certain safety goals, including a target total recordable incident rate of less than one.
•Health and Wellness. Our employee benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce across the Company and we believe are consistent with those provided by our peer companies with which we compete for talent. The Company provides employees with the ability to participate in health and welfare plans, including medical, dental, life, accidental death and dismemberment and short-term and long-term disability insurance plans. In 2020, we made the following adjustments to address the COVID-19 pandemic;
◦instituted a remote work environment to the extent feasible to help protect our workforce from exposure to COVID-19 by limiting physical contact as much as possible;
◦limited visitors to our offices and other work locations and encouraged all employees and visitors to wear masks at our offices and other work locations; and
◦provided coverage for COVID-19 testing and vaccination under the Company’s medical plan at no cost to our employees.
