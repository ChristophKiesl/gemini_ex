Business Overview
Energy Fuels is engaged in conventional and in situ (“ISR”) uranium extraction and recovery, along with the exploration, permitting, and evaluation of uranium properties in the United States. Energy Fuels owns the Nichols Ranch Uranium Recovery Facility in Wyoming (the “Nichols Ranch Project”), which is one of the newest uranium recovery facilities operating in the United States, and the Alta Mesa Project in Texas (the "Alta Mesa Project"), which is an ISR production center currently on care and maintenance. In addition, Energy Fuels owns the White Mesa Mill in Utah (the “White Mesa Mill” or “Mill”), which is the only conventional uranium recovery facility operating in the United States. The Company also owns uranium and uranium/vanadium properties and projects in various stages of exploration, permitting, and evaluation, as well as fully-permitted uranium and uranium/vanadium projects on standby. The White Mesa Mill can also recover vanadium as a co-product of mineralized material produced from certain of its projects in Colorado and Utah. In addition, Energy Fuels recovers uranium from other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional material, referred to as “alternate feed materials,” at its White Mesa Mill.
The Company’s activities are divided into two segments: the “ISR Uranium Segment” and the “Conventional Uranium Segment.”
8

ISR Uranium Segment
The Company conducts its ISR activities through its Nichols Ranch Project in northeast Wyoming, which it acquired in June 2015 through its acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation (“Uranerz”), and its Alta Mesa Project in south Texas, which it acquired in June 2016 through its acquisition of Mesteña Uranium, LLC (“Mesteña”), which is now named EFR Alta Mesa LLC ("EFR Alta Mesa"). 
The Nichols Ranch Project includes: (i) a licensed and operating ISR processing facility (the “Nichols Ranch Plant”); (ii) licensed and operating ISR wellfields (the “Nichols Ranch Wellfields”); (iii) planned ISR wellfields currently in the licensing process (the “Jane Dough Property”), and; (iv) a licensed satellite ISR uranium project (the “Hank Project”), which will include an ISR processing plant (the “Hank Satellite Plant”) that, when constructed, will produce loaded-resin, and associated planned wellfields (the “Hank Property”). See “The Nichols Ranch ISR Project” under Item 2 below. Also through the acquisition of Uranerz, the Company acquired the Reno Creek property (the “Reno Creek Property”), West North Butte property (the “West North Butte Property”), and the North Rolling Pin property (the “North Rolling Pin Property”), as well as the Arkose Mining Venture (the “Arkose Mining Venture”), which is a joint venture of Wyoming ISR properties held 81% by Energy Fuels. See “Non-Material Mineral Properties – Other ISR Projects” under Item 2 below. 
The Nichols Ranch Project is an operating ISR facility that recovers uranium through a series of injection and recovery wells. Using groundwater fortified with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, uranium is dissolved within a deposit. The groundwater is then collected in a series of recovery wells and pumped to the Nichols Ranch Plant. The Nichols Ranch Plant creates a yellowcake slurry that is transported by truck to the White Mesa Mill, where it is dried and packaged into drums that are shipped to uranium conversion facilities.
Construction of the Nichols Ranch Plant, other than the elution, drying and packaging circuits, was completed in 2013, and it commenced uranium recovery activities in the second quarter of 2014. In September of 2015, the Company commenced construction of an elution circuit at the Nichols Ranch Plant, which was completed and began operations in February 2016. During 2016, a total of 335,000 pounds of U3O8 were recovered from the Nichols Ranch Project.
The Alta Mesa Project is a fully licensed, permitted and constructed ISR processing facility that has an operating capacity of 1.5 million pounds of uranium per year and comprises 195,501 contiguous acres of land. The Alta Mesa Project is currently on standby and ready to resume production as market conditions warrant; Alta Mesa can reach commercial production levels with limited required capital within six months of a production decision. See “The Alta Mesa Project” under Item 2 below.
Conventional Uranium Segment
The Company conducts its conventional uranium extraction and recovery activities through its White Mesa Mill, which is the only operating conventional uranium mill in the United States. The White Mesa Mill, located near Blanding Utah, is centrally located such that it can be fed by a number of the Company’s uranium and uranium/vanadium projects in Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, as well as by ore purchases or toll milling arrangements with third party miners in the region as market conditions warrant.
The White Mesa Mill is a 2,000 ton per day uranium recovery facility, which can also process vanadium as a co-product of mineralized material extracted from certain uranium/vanadium properties. In addition, the Mill can recycle other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional ore, referred to as "alternate feed materials", for the recovery of uranium, alone or in combination with other metals.
The White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign basis, whereby mineral processing occurs as mill feed, contract requirements, and market conditions warrant. Over the years, the Company’s own, and third-party owned, conventional uranium properties in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico have been both active and on standby, from time-to-time, in response to changing market conditions. From 2007 through 2014, running on a campaign basis, the White Mesa Mill recovered on average over 1 million pounds of  U3O8 per year from conventional sources, including its La Sal Project, Daneros Project, and Tony M property in Utah; its Arizona 1 and Pinenut Projects in Arizona; and alternate feed materials. During 2015, the Mill recovered a total of 296,000 lbs. of U3O8, of which 25,000 pounds were recovered from conventional materials and the remainder from processing alternate feed materials (including 72,000 pounds for the account of a third party). During 2016, the Mill recovered a total of 680,000 lbs. of U3O8, of which 432,816 pounds were recovered from conventional materials from the Company's Pinenut Project and 248,492 pounds from processing alternate feed materials. 
The Company’s Pinenut Project, where mineral extraction activities occurred until September 2015, is now depleted, and reclamation activities have commenced. The Company continues to receive and process alternate feed materials at the White Mesa Mill. At the Company’s permitted Canyon Project, shaft-sinking activities and an underground drilling program are taking place and are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017. The timing to extract and process mineralized material from the Canyon Project will be based on the evaluation of this underground drilling program, along with market conditions, available 
9

financing, and sales requirements. All of the Company’s other conventional properties and projects are currently in the permitting process or on standby pending improvements in market conditions. No third party conventional properties are active at this time.
The Company also owns the Sheep Mountain Project (the “Sheep Mountain Project”), which is a conventional uranium extraction project located in Wyoming. Due to its distance from the White Mesa Mill, the Sheep Mountain Project is not expected to be a source of feed material for the Mill. The Sheep Mountain Project consists of permitted open pit and underground extraction components (the “Sheep Mountain Extraction Operation”) and a planned processing facility to process extracted mineralized material (the “Sheep Mountain Processing Operation”), which has not yet been permitted.
The Company’s principal conventional properties include the following:

• | the White Mesa Mill, a 2,000 ton per day uranium and vanadium processing facility located near Blanding, Utah, held through the Company’s subsidiary EFR White Mesa LLC. See “The White Mesa Mill” under Item 2 below;

On March 7, 2016, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (the “Alta Mesa Purchase Agreement”) to acquire Mesteña Uranium, LLC (now named “EFR Alta Mesa LLC”) (the “Alta Mesa Acquisition”), which owns the Alta Mesa Project, located in South Texas. The Alta Mesa Acquisition closed on June 17, 2016 when the Company issued 4,551,284 Common Shares to the former owners of Alta Mesa. The Company assumed the existing $11.0 million reclamation obligation for the project, but acquired the existing cash collateral backing the reclamation obligation in the amount of approximately $4.4 million. 
On March 14, 2016, the Company closed a public offering of units made pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated March 9, 2016 between the Company and a syndicate of underwriters led by Cantor Fitzgerald Canada Corporation, as sole bookrunner, along with Haywood Securities Inc., Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Dundee Securities Ltd., Raymond James Ltd., and Rodman & Renshaw, a unit of H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC. Pursuant to the offering, the Company sold an aggregate of 5,031,250 Units (which includes 656,250 Units that were issued upon the exercise, in full, of the over-allotment option that was granted to the underwriters) at a price of $2.40 per Unit for gross proceeds of $12.075 million.  Each unit consisted of one common share and one half of one common share purchase warrant for a total of 5,031,250 common shares and 2,515,625 warrants. Each full warrant is exercisable until March 14, 2019 and will entitle the holder thereof to acquire one common shares upon exercise at an exercise price of $3.20 per common share.
On May 27, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Sumitomo Corporation’s 40% interest in the Roca Honda Project, which is now 100% owned and controlled by the Company. As consideration for the 40% interest, the Company issued to Sumitomo 1,212,173 common shares of the Company and agreed to pay $4.5 million of cash upon the first commercial production of uranium from the Roca Honda Project.
Effective July 1, 2016, the Company appointed Mark Chalmers as its Chief Operating Officer.
On August 4, 2016 the Company obtained approval from holders of its Floating-Rate Convertible Unsecured Subordinated Debentures (the “Debentures”) to amend the terms of the Debentures as follows: the maturity date was extended from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2020; the conversion price of the Debentures was reduced from Cdn$15.00 to Cdn$4.50 per Common Share; a redemption provision was added to enable the Company to redeem the Debentures upon 30 days notice, in cash, in 
11

whole or in part, any time after June 30, 2019 but prior to maturity at a price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount redeemed; a right was added to enable each Debenture holder to require the Company to purchase, for cash, on June 30, 2017 up to 20% of the Debentures held by such holder at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount purchased; and certain amendments were made to the Indenture as required by the U.S. Trust Indenture Act. As of March 8, 2017 a total of Cdn$22,000,000 principal amount of Debentures were outstanding.
On September 20, 2016, the Company closed an underwritten equity financing with a syndicate of underwriters led by Cantor Fitzgerald Canada Corporation and H.C. Wainwright under which the underwriters bought on an underwritten basis 8,337,500 units, each unit consisting of one Common Share and one half of one warrant at a price of $1.80 per unit for gross proceeds of $15,007,500. Each whole warrant is exercisable for five years after the date of closing and entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share upon exercise at an exercise price of $2.45 per share. 
On November 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Gas Hills, Juniper Ridge and Shirley Basin properties, none of which were considered material to the Company.
The Company filed a prospectus supplement on December 23, 2016 in both Canada and the United States to its Canadian base shelf prospectus and U.S. registration statement on Form S-3, both of which were filed on May 4, 2016. Concurrent with the filing of the prospectus supplement, the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. which enabled the Company, at its discretion from time to time, to sell, through Cantor as agent, up to $20 million worth of Common Shares by way of an “at-the-market” offering (the “ATM”). Under the ATM, sales of the shares are authorized to occur by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions or block trades, with sales only being made on the NYSE MKT at market prices. No Common Shares are authorized to be offered or sold through the ATM on the TSX. The offering of common shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon (a) the sale of all common shares subject to the Sales Agreement or (b) the termination of the Sales Agreement by the Company or by Cantor. Cantor may terminate the Sales Agreement under the circumstances specified in the Sales Agreement. Each of the Company and Cantor may also terminate the Sales Agreement upon giving the other party 10 days notice. From January 1, 2017 to March 8, 2017, a total of 2,990,983 Common Shares have been sold under the ATM, for net proceeds to the Company of $6.65 million. 
Company Strategy
Energy Fuels intends to continue to strengthen its position as a leading uranium extraction and recovery company focused on the United States. With the acquisitions of Uranerz and EFR Alta Mesa, the Company has added ISR recovery to our portfolio that, along with certain of the Company’s conventional projects and alternate feed material processing at the White Mesa Mill, sit at the lower end of the Company’s cost curve. With its large uranium resource base and existing conventional projects on standby, under construction, and in permitting, the Company’s strategy is to remain a unique and valuable call option on increases in the price of uranium, with significant scalability in improved market conditions. The Company currently intends to maintain its ISR and conventional uranium recovery capabilities, uranium resource base, and scalability. However, continued weakness in uranium prices and cash needs dictate that the Company engage in further measures to maintain the value of this option. As a result, at this time we intend to conserve cash and focus on our lowest cost uranium sources of uranium recovery, as follows:

• | Produce from existing wellfields (wellfields #1 through #9) at Nichols Ranch and defer further wellfield development at Nichols Ranch until uranium prices improve;


• | Continue alternate feed processing and recovery of uranium from uranium dissolved in the Mill’s ponds, as well as pursue additional alternate feed materials and other sources of feed for the Mill;


• | Complete the shaft sinking and evaluation of the Canyon Project. It is currently expected that the shaft sinking will be completed in the first quarter of 2017 and the evaluation will be completed by mid-2017, at which time the project may be put into production or placed on standby depending on the outcome of the evaluation, market conditions at that time and other factors;


• | Continuing to maintain standby projects and facilities (including the Alta Mesa Project, La Sal Project and the Daneros Project) in a state of readiness for the purpose of restarting mining activities, as market conditions may warrant. At this time, all of the Company’s conventional projects, other than the shaft sinking and evaluation at the Canyon Mine, are expected to remain on standby until market conditions warrant restarting mining activities, or are in the evaluation or permitting process;


• | Complete permits and permit updates for Jane Dough, Daneros and La Sal projects by mid-2017 and continue permitting activities for the Roca Honda project through the end of 2018;


• | Continue to evaluate the sale or abandonment of non-core assets that the Company does not believe will add value in order to reduce costs and/or receive sales proceeds; and

12


• | Pursue additional cost cutting measures.

Subsequent Events
On January 10, 2017, the United States Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") issued a final environmental impact statement and record of decision for the Company’s 100%-owned Sheep Mountain Project in the Crooks Gap Mining District in central Wyoming. The issuance of the environmental impact statement and the record of decision, together with the mine permit for the project issued in June 2015, are the last major government approvals required to commence mining at this project, as the Company continues to evaluate options for processing the resources that may be mined at the project, including toll processing at other facilities in the region and the licensing and construction of its own onsite facility.
Effective January 16, 2017, Hyung Mun Bae resigned from the Company’s board of directors. Mr. Bae resigned in connection with the transfer of the Common Shares held by KEPCO to KHNP Canada Energy Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of KEPCO.
Effective January 31, 2017, Harold Roberts, Executive Vice President, Conventional Operations for the Company, retired. Effective February 1, 2017, Mark Chalmers, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer, assumed responsibility for all conventional mining and White Mesa Mill operations for the Company. To ensure a smooth transition, Mr. Roberts entered into a Professional Services Agreement pursuant to which Mr. Roberts will act as a part-time consultant through May 1, 2017 or later as may be agreed to by both parties. 
Uranium Sales
The Company has four existing contracts, which require deliveries of 520,000 pounds of U3O8 in 2017, and three existing contracts which require deliveries of 400,000 pounds of U3O8 in 2018. One contract expires after the 2017 deliveries, two contracts expire after the 2018 deliveries, and another contract expires in 2020. Of the 920,000 pounds of deliveries for 2017 and 2018, a total of 520,000 pounds of U3O8 is required to come from the Company’s uranium recovery operations, while Energy Fuels has the option to fulfill the remaining 400,000 pounds of U3O8 from the Company’s uranium recovery operations and/or open market purchases. At December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 488,000 pounds of finished goods inventory from the Company’s uranium recovery operations.
In 2017 and 2018, the Company expects to have sufficient existing inventory or uranium recovery to meet all of its commitments to sell 920,000 pounds of uranium under its existing contracts.
The average expected realized price per pound under the existing contracts is expected to be lower in 2017 than 2016 levels. While 320,000 pounds of 2017 contract sales are being sold pursuant to long-term contracts that are priced at the minimum floor prices now in effect or the prices being fixed, 200,000 pounds are being sold at spot prices in effect at the times of delivery. Additional selective spot sales may be made in 2017 as necessary to generate cash for operations.
Segment Information
The Company engages in conventional and ISR uranium extraction and recovery, in addition to uranium exploration and project permitting. The Company’s source of conventional uranium recovery is the White Mesa Mill, which generates revenue through conventional processing, alternate feed material processing, and toll processing agreements (the “Conventional Uranium Segment”). The Company's sources of ISR uranium recovery are the Nichols Ranch Project and the Alta Mesa Project (the “ISR Uranium Segment”). Although the principal product of both segments is uranium concentrate, or “yellowcake,” the methods of extraction and recovery differ. In addition, the Conventional Uranium Segment provides services at the White Mesa Mill, namely alternate feed material processing and toll processing, which the Company’s ISR Uranium Segment does not provide.
Set forth below is a chart depicting the two segments of the Company’s business, together with the properties and services associated with each segment:

Overview of Uranium Market
The primary commercial use of uranium is to fuel nuclear power plants for the generation of electricity. All of the uranium extracted from Energy Fuels’ projects is expected to be used for this purpose.
According to the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”), as of January 1, 2017, there are currently 447 operable reactors world-wide, which required approximately 165 million pounds of U3O8 fuel per year at full operation. Worldwide there are currently 60 new reactors under construction with an additional 164 reactors on order, or in the planning stage and another 347 which have been proposed.
According to data from TradeTech LLC (“TradeTech”), the world continues to require more uranium than it produces from primary extraction, largely due to increasing uranium demands in Asia. The gap between demand and primary supply has been filled by stockpiled inventories and secondary supplies.
According to the WNA, the United States currently has 99 operating reactors, four reactors under construction, and another 42 reactors on order, planned or proposed. According to the NEI, the United States produced approximately 19.5% of its electricity from nuclear technology in 2016. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency (“EIA”), U.S. utilities purchased approximately 56.5 million pounds of U3O8 in 2016. However, in 2015 the U.S. only produced approximately 3.3 million pounds of U3O8. As a result, in 2015, the U.S. filled about 94% of its demand from foreign sources. The EIA estimates that 2016 production was approximately 2.9 million pounds.
Uranium is not traded on an open market or organized commodity exchange such as the London Metal Exchange, although the New York Mercantile Exchange provides financially-settled uranium futures contracts. Typically, buyers and sellers negotiate transactions privately and directly. Spot uranium transactions typically involve deliveries that occur immediately and up to 12 months in the future. Term uranium transactions typically involve deliveries that occur more than 12 months in the future, with long-term transactions involving delivery terms of at least three years. Uranium prices, both spot prices and term prices, are 
14

published by two independent market consulting firms, TradeTech and The Ux Consulting Company (“Ux”), on a weekly and monthly basis.
The spot and term prices of uranium are influenced by a number of global factors. For example, both the spot and term prices of uranium were impacted by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant in March 2011. The events at Fukushima created heightened concerns regarding the safety of nuclear plants and led to both temporary and permanent closures of nuclear plants around the world. The Fukushima incident has created downward pressure on uranium prices over the past six years, which is still being felt today. Alternatively, China is pursuing an aggressive nuclear program, with 36 units now operating, 21 new units under construction, 40 units which are planned, and 139 units that have been proposed, according to March 2017 WNA data.
Historically, most nuclear utilities have sought to purchase a portion of their uranium needs through long-term supply contracts, while other portions are bought on the spot market. Like sellers, buyers seek to balance the security of long term supply with the opportunity to take advantage of lower prices caused by volatility in prices. For this reason, both buyers and sellers track current spot and long-term prices for uranium carefully, make considered projections as to future prices, and negotiate with one another on transactions which each deems favorable to their respective interests. According to data from Trade Tech, levels of long-term contracting in 2016 were well below historical averages.

To give a more recent perspective, the graph below shows the monthly spot (blue line) and long-term (red line) uranium price from January 2010 until February 2017 as reported by TradeTech (not adjusted for inflation):
According to monthly price data from TradeTech, uranium prices during 2016 were down $13.95, or 41% for the year. Monthly spot prices began the year at $34.20 per pound of U3O8 on December 31, 2015 and ended the year at $20.25 per pound, reaching a high of $34.65 per pound for the month of January 2016 and a low of $17.75 per pound for the month of November 2016.

According to Trade Tech, the spot price was $25.75 per pound on March 8, 2017. TradeTech price data also indicated that long-term U3O8 prices began 2016 at $44.00 per pound and ended 2016 at $30.00 per pound, the low long-term price for the year. The long-term price at February 28, 2017 was $35.00 per pound. The high long-term price for 2016 was $44.00 per pound. The Company believes the weak uranium markets are the result of excess uranium supplies caused by large quantities of secondary uranium extraction and excess inventories, the availability of low-priced spot material, the delayed restart of Japanese reactors, insufficient production cut-backs, premature reactor closures, continued weak uranium demand, and general weakness in the global economy.
Uranium Market Outlook and Uranium Marketing Strategy
World demand for clean, reliable, and affordable baseload electricity is growing. As a result of the expected growth of nuclear energy, the Company believes the long-term fundamentals of the uranium industry are positive. The Company believes prices must rise to higher levels to support the new primary production that will be required to meet the increasing demand we expect to see as more nuclear units are constructed around the world. According to TradeTech, world uranium requirements continue to exceed primary mine production, with the gap being bridged by secondary supplies and excess uranium inventories in various forms that have already been mined. As excess inventories are drawn down and as production from existing mines drops, the Company believes primary mine production will be required to meet demand over the long-term. According to data from TradeTech, long-term contracting levels in 2016 were low by historical standards. The Company believes uranium prices, and long-term contracting levels in particular, will need to rise to levels that are sufficient to incentivize new mine production. Even if prices rise to these levels, it may be difficult for suppliers to respond in a timely manner, as it typically requires many years of permitting and development to bring new mines into production. The Company expects these permitting and development lead times to put further pressure on prices to increase.
Despite current market uncertainty and recently falling prices throughout most of 2016, the Company believes prices likely hit a bottom in 2016. Since December 1, 2016, spot prices have risen 44% from $17.75 to $25.50 for a variety of reasons. In December 2016, it was announced that the State of Illinois passed legislation to keep three nuclear power plants operating that were previously slated to close. In January 2017, it was announced that Kazakhstan would reduce 2017 uranium production by 10% (5 million+ lbs.) after several years of production increases. On a longer-term basis, according to data from TradeTech and the WNA, Chinese utilities continue to aggressively build new reactors and buy uranium. And, in addition to China, according to the WNA, there are large numbers of new reactors under construction and in various stages of planning around the world.
In the short- and medium-terms, market challenges remain. The world continues to be oversupplied with uranium, mainly due to large quantities of secondary and other inelastic uranium supplies (including enricher underfeeding), high levels of excess inventories, insufficient producer cut-backs, premature reactor shutdowns, delays in new reactor construction, two large new mines coming into production (Cigar Lake and Husab), and decreased demand due to Japanese reactors remaining offline for longer than expected (though it should be noted that Husab has experienced start-up delays). In addition, there is a great deal of uncertainty in uranium prices regarding the timing and level of the recovery, as fundamental, political, technical, and other factors could cause prices to be significantly above or below currently expected ranges.
Nevertheless, according to data from Trade Tech, global utilities have significant uncovered uranium requirements over the next 10 years, which the Company expects will increase levels of market activity in the short- and medium-terms.
The Company’s marketing strategy is to seek a base of earnings and cash flow through sales of a portion of its uranium into term contracts. To gain exposure to increasing uranium prices, the Company seeks to sell a portion of its planned uranium extraction into contracts with market-related formulas (when available) and through future spot and term sales. Further exposure to increasing uranium prices can be generated through the Company’s ability to bring additional uranium extraction online in the future in response to increasing prices, which can be sold on a market-related or fixed basis at then prevailing prices. Certain of the Company’s current existing contracts utilize market-related formulas with base, floor and ceiling prices, some of which are escalated at the rate of inflation. Another of the Company's contracts contains pricing at a 0.5% discount to the spot price at the time of delivery. During 2016, the pricing on all of the Company’s contracts, other than the spot contract referenced above, were at their floors or at prices fixed by the contract. During 2016, the Company sold 1,147,933 pounds of U3O8 at a weighted- average price of $47.42 per pound. This included 850,000 pounds of sales under contracts at a weighted average price of $56.54 per pound and 297,933 pounds based on spot market prices at a weighted average price of $21.10 per pound. In 2017, the Company expects to sell a total of 520,000 pounds of U3O8 into its three existing contracts at pricing expected to average approximately $48.05 per pound based on current forecasts of spot prices and price inflation. Additional selective spot sales may be made in 2017 as necessary to generate cash for operations.
The Vanadium Market
The White Mesa Mill has historically recovered vanadium as a co-product of uranium from certain of its properties on the Colorado Plateau, most notably from the La Sal Project, as well as from properties owned by third-parties on the Colorado Plateau through 
16

toll milling and similar arrangements, when the price of vanadium has been high enough to justify its recovery. The Mill’s most recent vanadium recovery occurred in 2013 when it recovered 1.5 million pounds of vanadium.
According to the market consultant TTP Squared, Inc. (“TTP”), the vast majority of vanadium is used in the production of high strength steels (approximately 93%); 3% is used in titanium alloys in aerospace and other applications; and another 4% is used in catalyst and chemical applications. Today, while only a minor quantity of vanadium is used in energy storage applications, there is potential for greatly expanded use of vanadium in emerging battery technologies.
According to data from the Vanadium International Technical Committee compiled by TTP, vanadium consumption in 2014 is estimated to have been in excess of 92,000 metric tons. However, as the demand for high strength, high performance steels increases, and as new uses are developed for lightweight, high strength titanium alloys, vanadium demand can be expected to increase at a faster rate than the growth of global steel production. The average vanadium content in steel in developing countries is much lower than the ratios in the developed countries and can be expected to increase, adding to the demand. If high-capacity batteries using vanadium are commercialized, demand can be expected to increase further. The Company believes the future prospects for vanadium are highly dependent on continued growth in China.
While demand is expected to grow over time, supply likely has the capacity to increase to meet this demand. Most vanadium is recovered as a byproduct or coproduct of other processes. Many primary producers, in countries such as China, Russia and South Africa, have been shut down due to low prices. Extraction of vanadium from steel making slag has been cut back or halted. As demand increases and prices strengthen, some of these facilities can be expected to restart or increase production, thus moderating any anticipated price increases.
Vanadium (as V2O5) prices were up for 2016, beginning the year at $2.38 per pound, and ending the year at $5.03 per pound. Vanadium prices are currently at $5.13 per pound.
While long-term demand for vanadium can be expected to increase, it is unknown whether future prices for vanadium will increase due to the relatively high number of low-cost suppliers who may re-enter the market as prices increase.
Vanadium Marketing
In the past, Energy Fuels has sold its vanadium both as V2O5 and as ferrovanadium (“FeV”) through spot sales to industry end-users and trading companies. No vanadium was recovered or sold by the Company during 2016, and none is expected to be recovered or sold until uranium and/or vanadium prices improve.
Competition
The uranium industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with mining and exploration companies for uranium sales, the acquisition of uranium mineral properties, and the procurement of equipment, materials and personnel necessary to explore, develop, and extract uranium from such properties. There is competition for a limited number of uranium acquisition opportunities, including competition with other companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than the Company. As a result, the Company may encounter challenges in acquiring attractive properties, and exploring and advancing properties currently in the Company’s portfolio. In addition, Energy Fuels competes with other uranium recovery companies, along with traders, brokers, financial institutions, converters, enrichers, and other market actors, for uranium sales. Due to the Company’s limited capital and personnel and the relative size of its operations, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to some other companies with regard to exploration and, if warranted, development of mining properties and securing uranium sales. The Company believes that competition for acquiring mineral prospects and completing uranium sales will continue to be intense in the future.
The availability of funds for exploration, evaluation, permitting and construction of uranium projects is limited, and the Company may find it difficult to compete with larger and more established uranium exploration and production companies for capital. The Company’s inability to continue exploration, advancement, and the acquisition of new properties due to lack of funding could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future operations and financial position.
Government Regulation
The Company’s properties and facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations which are overseen and enforced by multiple federal, state and local authorities. These laws govern exploration, construction, extraction, recovery, processing, exports, various taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, toxic and hazardous substances, and other matters. Uranium minerals exploration, extraction, recovery, and processing are also subject to risks and liabilities associated with the perceived potential for pollution of the environment and disposal of waste products occurring as a result of such activities.
17

Compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on the Company and will subject the Company to significant potential liabilities. Changes in these regulations could require the Company to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business operations.
Environmental Regulations
Exploration, development, and extraction activities are subject to certain environmental regulations which may prevent or delay the continuance of our activities. In general, our exploration, evaluation, and extraction activities are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation. Specifically, we are subject to legislation regarding emissions into the environment, water discharges, and storage and disposition of hazardous wastes. In addition, legislation has been enacted which requires facility sites to be reclaimed in accordance with such legislation. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition to date.
Uranium milling in the U.S. is primarily regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the “NRC”) pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Its primary function is to ensure the protection of employees, the public, and the environment from radioactive materials, and it also regulates most aspects of the uranium recovery process. The NRC regulations pertaining to uranium recovery facilities are codified in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
On August 16, 2004, the State of Utah became an Agreement State for the regulation of uranium mills. This means that the primary regulator for the White Mesa Mill is now the State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality (“UDEQ”) rather than the NRC. At that time, the Mill’s NRC Source Material License was transferred to the State of Utah and became a Radioactive Materials License. The State of Utah incorporates, through its own regulations or by reference, all aspects of Title 10 pertaining to uranium recovery facilities. When the State of Utah became an Agreement State, it required that a Groundwater Discharge Permit (“GWDP”) be put in place for the White Mesa Mill. The GWDP is required for all similar facilities in the State of Utah, and specifically tailors the implementation of the state groundwater regulations to the Mill site. The State of Utah requires that every operating uranium mill have a GWDP, regardless of whether or not the facility discharges to groundwater. The GWDP for the Mill was finalized and implemented in March 2005. The White Mesa Mill also maintains a permit approval for air emissions with the UDEQ, Division of Air Quality.
Conventional uranium extraction is subject to regulation by a number of agencies including: (1) local county and municipal government agencies; (2) the applicable state divisions responsible for mining and protecting the environment within Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming; (3) the BLM and the United States Forest Service (the “USFS”) on public lands under their jurisdiction; (4) the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”); (5) the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) for radon emissions from underground mines; and (6) other federal agencies (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corp. of Engineers, DOE), where certain conditions exist. In addition, a uranium processing facility at the Sheep Mountain Project will be subject to regulation under the NRC, as a uranium processing facility and for permanent disposal of the resulting tailings.
The provisions of the Atomic Energy Act and its regulations that are applicable to uranium milling also apply to our ISR facilities in Wyoming and Texas. The Nichols Ranch Project and the Alta Mesa Project each have a Source Material license issued by the NRC, in the case of Nichols Ranch, and, as Texas is an Agreement State, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, in the case of Alta Mesa. ISR facilities are also regulated by the State of Wyoming and State of Texas, respectively, and the EPA under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In addition, ISR wellfields require an Underground Injection Control Permit under the Safe Drinking Water Act, as administered by the EPA. ISR operations are subject to regulations by the U.S. Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), rather than MSHA.
Reclamation bonds or the equivalent have been posted for each of the Company’s material properties that have structures or facilities.
Energy Fuels is required to have export licenses issued by the NRC for its uranium exports. Such licenses are obtained by the Company as required.
Land Tenure
The Company’s land holdings are held either by leases from the fee simple owners (private parties or the State) or unpatented mining claims located on property owned and managed by the U.S. Federal Government. Annual fees must be paid to maintain unpatented mining claims, but work expenditures are not required. Holders of unpatented mining claims are generally granted surface access to conduct mineral exploration and extraction activities. However, additional permits and plans are generally required prior to conducting exploration or mining activities on such claims.

On July 9, 2009, BLM issued a Notice of Proposed Withdrawal (“2009 Notice”) under which it proposed that a total of approximately one million acres of public lands around the Grand Canyon National Park be withdrawn from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872 (the “Mining Law”), subject to valid existing rights. In the 2009 Notice, BLM stated that the purpose of the withdrawal, if determined to be appropriate, would be to protect the Grand Canyon watershed from any adverse effects of locatable hardrock mineral exploration and mining. The 2009 Notice segregated the lands from location and entry under the mining laws for up to two years to allow time for various studies and analyses, including appropriate NEPA analysis. In order to allow more time for BLM to complete its NEPA analysis, the U.S. Department of the Interior (the “DOI”) published Public Land Order 7773 on June 21, 2011, which affected a six-month emergency withdrawal of the area. The emergency withdrawal prevented the lands from opening to location and entry under the Mining Law upon expiration of the two-year segregation while the DOI completed the decision–making process on the proposed withdrawal. The emergency withdrawal was effective July 21, 2011 to January 20, 2012. During the two-year segregation and six month emergency withdrawal, the BLM, along with its cooperating agencies, completed various studies and analyses of resources in the withdrawal area, including an EIS under NEPA. These studies and analyses were undertaken to provide the basis for the final decision regarding whether or not to proceed with the proposed withdrawal or to select an alternative action. Based on this analysis, on January 9, 2012, the DOI announced its final decision to withdraw from location and entry under the Mining Law, subject to valid existing rights, the total of approximately one million acres of lands originally proposed in the 2009 Notice (the “Withdrawn Lands”), for a 20-year period. Lawsuits challenging this decision have been filed by various industry groups and interested parties.
No new mining claims may be filed on the Withdrawn Lands and no new Plans of Operations may be approved, other than Plans of Operations on mining claims that were valid at the time of withdrawal and that remain valid at the time of plan approval. Whether or not a mining claim is valid must be determined by a mineral examination conducted by BLM or USFS, as applicable. The mineral examination, which involves an economic evaluation of a project, must demonstrate the existence of a locatable mineral resource and that the mineral resource constitutes the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit.
All of the Company’s properties located on the Arizona Strip, with the exception of its Wate property and certain exploration properties held by the Company’s subsidiary, Arizona Strip Partners LLC, are located within the Withdrawn Lands. A mineral examination on the Company’s EZ Project will need to be completed by BLM, in conjunction with its review of the Company’s proposed Plan of Operations for that project. Mineral examinations were not required for the Company’s Arizona 1 and Pinenut projects, which had previously approved Plans of Operations and were recently active. Although the Company’s Canyon Project also has an approved Plan of Operation, and a mineral examination is not required, the USFS performed a mineral examination on that project in 2012 and concluded that the Canyon Project’s claims constitute valid existing rights. The USFS also concluded that no additional approvals are required on the Canyon Project.
The Company believes that all of its material projects within the Withdrawn Lands are on valid mining claims that will each withstand a mineral examination. However, market conditions may postpone or prevent the performance of mineral examinations on certain properties and, if a mineral examination is performed on a property, there can be no guarantee that the mineral examination would not result in one of more of the Company’s mining claims being considered invalid, which could prevent a project from proceeding.
Further, there are efforts underway that have the potential to create a National Monument on the Withdrawn Lands, and additional lands, near the Grand Canyon National Park. These efforts include proposed legislation which has been introduced in Congress and lobbying of the President of the United States to create a National Monument utilizing his executive powers under the Antiquities Act of 1906. All of the Company’s projects on the Arizona Strip, except the Wate Project, are located on lands which have the potential to be included in a National Monument. If such a National Monument is created, there is the potential that these projects could become subject to additional requirements and/or costs, or be prevented from proceeding.
In addition, President Obama designated the Bears Ears National Monument by executive order in December of 2016, which comprises 1.35 million acres of land in San Juan County, Utah. The designated land includes a portion of the County road which the Company relies on for access to its Daneros Project as well as abuts up against a portion of the property boundary of the White Mesa Mill and encompasses two water sampling sites the Company monitors for the Mill. At this time, the impact to the Company of the Bears Ears National Monument designation is not known, however it is possible that the Daneros Project and/or the White Mesa Mill could become subject to additional requirements, restrictions and costs as a result of the designation.
Employees
