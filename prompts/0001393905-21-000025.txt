ITEM 1: BUSINESS
General
 
We were incorporated on August 4, 2010, under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name SOS Link Corporation. On April 15, 2011, we changed our place of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the Province of British Columbia, Canada and concurrently changed our name to Venza Gold Corp. The change from Nevada to British Columbia was approved by our shareholders on April 14, 2011. On January 6, 2014, we changed our name to CoreComm Solutions Inc., on February 11, 2015, we changed our name to VGrab Communications Inc., and on December 23, 2020, we changed our name to Duesenberg Technologies Inc. 
 
On February 10, 2015, we completed an acquisition of the VGrab software application (the VGrab Application) pursuant to the terms of a software purchase agreement dated January 8, 2015 (the Software Purchase Agreement) between us and Hampshire Capital Limited (Hampshire). The VGrab Application is a free mobile voucher application developed for smartphones using the Android and Apple iOS operating systems and allows users to redeem vouchers on their smartphones at a number of retailers and merchants. 
 
On June 24, 2015, we formed a subsidiary, VGrab International Ltd., (VGrab International) under the Labuan Companies Act 1990 in Federal Territory of Labuan, Malaysia. The initial focus of the VGrab International was to continue development of the VGrab Application and continue its market penetration in Southeast Asia. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, VGrab International is used as a holding company as all the business operations were moved to VGrab Communications Malaysia Sdn Bhd (VGrab Malaysia), which we incorporated on May 17, 2018, under the Malaysia Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The main business objective of Vgrab Malaysia is to facilitate online promotions, advertising and e-commerce.
 
Since its incorporation, VGrab Malaysia has been working on the development of its SMART System prototype. VGrabs new SMART System will consist of several modules, including VGrab Memberships system, which will allow its users to sign up via internet or quick response code, also known as QR Code, VGrab Cloud Management System (VCMS), and VGrab Database Management System (VDMS). VCMS and VDMS will form the backbone of VGrabs SMART System, integrating each future developed VGrab SMART Systems module into the platform. The Company is currently testing the development of the VGrab SMART System before deployment to potential clients.
 
On February 18, 2019, we formed another subsidiary, VGrab Asia Limited (Vgrab Asia). The main business objective of Vgrab Asia is to facilitate online promotions, advertising and e-commerce to its potential customer based in P.R.China. In addition, Vgrab Asia is going to position itself as commodities trader to capture the current market trends in P.R.China.
 
On March 5, 2019, VGrab Asia entered into a mobile application development agreement with a group of private software developers from China (the Vendor) to develop a mobile software application (VGrab WeChat Application). VGrab WeChat Application is developed for use with smartphones in P.R.China using the WeChat Android and Apple iOS operating systems allowing users to sign up for memberships, deposit money, purchase products, redeem vouchers, upload media promotions onto the smartphones, etc... On August 14, 2019, the VGrab WeChat Application was tested and completed for client usage.
 
In March of 2020 we completed development of the prototype VGrab vending machine (the Vending Machine) and were attempting to organize the first test run before starting a large-scale production and commercialization of the Vending Machines. Prior to COVID-19 measures, we were expecting to have the first prototype of the Vending Machine installed and operational at a local university by the end of April with further units to be placed across the universitys campus and other universities across Malaysia. However, due to COVID-19 measures, we were required to postpone the roll-out until the restrictions set to prevent the spread of virus are lifted and businesses are allowed to resume their normal operations.

The newly developed Vending Machine is customizable to sell variety of consumer products ranging from traditional snacks, soft drinks, and coffee, to prepaid mobile cards and other goods, while simultaneously displaying advertisements and other various promotional content. Each Vending Machine is based on the operating system developed by us, and is supplied with a credit card reader and a QR Code reader, which facilitate not only payments with credit cards, but also enables payments via eWallet and other membership-based payments.
 
On November 1, 2019, we incorporated Duesenberg Inc., a Nevada corporation (Duesenberg NV). The purpose of Duesenberg NV is to undertake the development of Electric Vehicle (Duesenberg EV) using the Duesenberg brand. We acquired the rights to use the Duesenberg name in 2018. We are planning to develop the Duesenberg EV in partnerships with leading developers and suppliers for various components into the vehicle, and also include our in-house developed VGrab SMART System as part of its operating system. 
 
On January 8, 2021, Duesenberg NV signed a contract with Rocket Supreme, the Barcelona, Spain automotive design house established by Christopher Reitz. The agreement is the first step towards creating a network of suppliers required to successfully complete the Duesenberg EV development project. We expect the design of the first Duesenberg EV to be released in late 2021.
 
In order to support the development and future production of Duesenberg EV, we will require significant financing. As at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have yet to secure the required financing, and cannot assure the reader that we will be successful in securing the required funding.
 
Business of Duesenberg Technologies Inc. (fka VGrab Communications Inc.) 
 
We continue to expand and evolve our corporate strategy. Subsequent to October 31, 2020, we have made another shift to integrate our SMART Systems with development of Duesenberg EV capitalizing on our acquisition of the rights to the use of the Duesenberg brand. Since the acquisition of the Vgrab technology in 2015, the Company has been in the business of advance information technology. We believe the integration of our SMART Systems with Electric Vehicle industry will allow the Company to open a new frontier in advancing its technology.
 
Alongside with venturing into Duesenberg EV development, we continue working on the development of our SMART Systems and Vending Machines. Since the early months of 2020 the retail and consumer markets have been largely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; majority of our potential clients for the SMART Systems and the Vending Machines have decided to postpone any purchases or joint ventures until such time that the global economy starts to recover. The Company decided to use the global situation brought on by COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to pivot, realign, and improve its SMART Systems based on the current and future expected market trends.
 
We see the current problem of energy resources, and eminent lack thereof, becoming one of the most important trends in the industry. Many various industries are turning towards development and use of clean, renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, wind energy, etc. Announcement of prototypes of electric vehicles and their mass productions scheduled for the near future are becoming everyday occurrence. Many vehicles are being designed to use only electricity as their main source of power.
 
With the development of Duesenberg EV, the Company will be involved in the EV technology revolution and is determined to redefine the primal relationship between vehicle and a driver, which has been trending in the last decade. Duesenbergs future EV technologies will be incorporated in nearly every component of a vehicle, from dashboard panels and passenger zones to the engine configuration, braking systems, headlights and tires, without minimizing attention to building comfortable and luxurious interiors for all of the individual handcrafted vehicles.
 
The Companys goal is to become climate-neutral across our full value chain, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change which was adopted by 196 Parties at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris, on December 12, 2015, and entered into force on November 4, 20161. We are committed to energy resiliency through Duesenbergs Vehicle Development in Energy Transition Goal2. The Paris Agreement identified an immediate and urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)

emissions to help mitigate the effects of climate change, through reduction of energy use, and improvement of air quality. 
 
Our Strategy and Distribution
 
Our marketing strategy will be based mainly on ensuring Duesenbergs EV, associated products, and Duesenberg brand are recognizable and trusted. We plan on achieving this goal through ensuring the adequate and timely information coupled with excellent service targeted towards our clients. Duesenberg brand is a well-known heritage brand and is highly respected in the automotive industry; we intend to uphold the standards set by its founders with our Duesenberg EV and products based on our SMART Technologies. 
 
We anticipate that initial target users of Duesenberg EV would consist of high net-worth individuals or car collectors. While in development of the prototype Duesenberg EV, we are planning to manufacture a limited-edition Duesenberg EV package to market to potential high net-worth individuals as Founders Series.
 
In order to achieve our goals and commence the manufacturing of the Founders Series vehicle, we will require substantial financing to secure various vendors, consultants, designers, manufacturers, and so on. There is no assurance that the Company and/or Duesenberg NV will be able to secure the necessary financing to commence the design and manufacturing of the Duesenberg EV, nor is there any assurance that the scheduled milestones will be attained as envisioned in our current plan of development. 
 
Additionally, the conceptual design of our vehicle does not have many of the legacy issues of current car manufacturers which allows our body, construction and powertrain infrastructure to be implemented in a far more cost-effective way than the existing car industry with more advanced use of Composites and Advanced Frame Techniques than traditional manufacturing allows.
 
Competition
 
The next generation of luxury automotive manufacturers are focusing on autonomous vehicles, connected vehicles, electric vehicles, and shared mobility trends. Automakers in the space of luxury electric vehicles are becoming more flexible, incorporating advanced technological and technical innovations. 
 
Duesenberg is planning to enter the United States market as the only Ultra-Premium EV. The Company will be required to compete with other non-electric Ultra-Premium combustion vehicles (ex. Bentley and Rolls Royce) as well as non-ultra premium EVs (ex. Tesla).
 
Our competitors include companies that have substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than us. Our failure to obtain and maintain a competitive position within the market could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Government Regulations
 
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business in the automotive industry and also on the Internet. Additionally, these laws and regulations may be interpreted differently across domestic and foreign jurisdictions. As a company in a new and rapidly growing industry, we are exposed to certain risks that many of these laws may change and are subject to uncertain interpretations. These laws and regulations may involve intellectual property, product liability and consumer protection, distribution, competition, online payment and point of sale services, employee, merchant and customer privacy and data security, taxes or other areas.
Patents and Trademarks
 
On June 25, 2018, the Company, through VGrab International Limited, assigned the rights from Brightcliff Ltd and Hampshire Motors Group (China) Limited for the use and development of its products under the brand of Duesenberg. The rights to use the Duesenberg brand expire on June 24, 2038.
 
Our VGrab name has also been trademarked under the registration certificate no 2014002852. The registration gives us non-exclusive right to use a letter V. The trademark is valid until March 14, 2024.

As at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have two customers with whom we operate under month-to-month verbal service agreements. Our first customer is Duesey Coffee and Chocolates Sdn Bhd (Duesey Coffee), of which Mr. Lim Hun Beng, our CEO and President, is a 50% shareholder. In addition, in the last quarter of our Fiscal 2020 year we started generating revenue from WeChat Online product, which was developed specifically for Duesey Coffee in P.R. China, and is being managed by Shanghai Duesenberg Marketing Planning Co Ltd. Due to current market uncertainty associated with COVID-19 we agreed to bill our customers set monthly fees for these services without entering into any termed contracts, which will allow us or our customers to cancel the services any time. Duesey Coffee agreed to a monthly fee of 10,000 Malaysian Ringgit (approximately USD$2,350), Shanghai Duesenberg Marketing Planning Co Ltd. agreed to a monthly fee of USD$1,000.

Pursuant to the Agreement, Vgrab International agreed to work with HMGC on developing marketing, advertising and customer relation programs for Duesenbergs brands, with newly-developed sub-brand, Duesey, and its Duesey Coffee being the initial product offering. Vgrab International is also expected to participate in the development of new products utilizing Duesenberg Trademark.
 
The term of the Agreement is 10 years, with an option to extend the Agreement for an additional 10-year period. Based on the Agreement, we will be entitled to a percentage of revenue generated from the sales of any new products developed by Vgrab International or jointly with HMGC, which percentage will be determined as follows: (i) 94% from revenue of up to $100,000, and (ii) 95% from revenue of over and above $100,000.
