Item 1. Business.

Overview
--------

 
Kaya Holdings, Inc., “KAYS” or the “Company” a Delaware corporation, is a vertically integrated legal marijuana enterprise that produces, distributes, and/or sells a full range of premium cannabis products including flower, oils, vape cartridges and cannabis infused confections, baked goods and beverages through a fully integrated group of subsidiaries and companies supporting highly distinctive brands.

KAYS is a veteran of the global legal cannabis industry, with more than six years of operational experience. KAYS is the first U.S. publicly traded company to operate a legal marijuana dispensary, as well as the first to vertically integrate by adding cultivation and manufacturing.
 
The Company’s business strategy seeks to achieve four fundamentals objectives:
 

· | maintaining direct access to customers (to own the relationship with end-users); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | effecting vertical integration to control the supply chain (to control cost, selection and quality); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | introducing strong brands in tradition and innovative categories (to control asset development); and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | creating the capacity to expand nationally and internationally as regulations and opportunities permit. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Kaya Holdings currently operates three majority-owned subsidiaries, each responding to various demands and opportunities in the cannabis industry, to aid in the execution of these objectives:
 
Marijuana Holdings Americas, Inc.
 
Marijuana Holdings Americas, Inc. (“MJAI”), incorporated in 2014, operates the Company’s U.S. based cannabis operations including its Kaya Shack™ retail brand and the Kaya Farms™ cultivation brand.
 
After an evaluation of several factors including reputation for cannabis excellence, costs of entry, learning opportunity, and ease of regulatory structure, the Company selected Oregon as its point-of-entry into the legal cannabis sector where it commenced operations in Oregon in July 2014. Oregon is universally recognized for its excellence in cannabis cultivation and is part of the famed “Green Triangle” of expert cannabis cultivation that also includes Northern California. Having Oregon as the Company’s learning ground has allowed the Company to combine “traditional” methods of cannabis cultivation with modern agriculture techniques.
 
The Company’s US operations are currently focused in Oregon, where all of the Company’s operations are licensed by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (the “OLCC’), which has jurisdiction over legal medical and recreational cannabis grow, production and retail operations. The Company has three active OLCC Marijuana Retailer Licenses, each of which allow for one brick-and-mortar physical dispensary location as well as unlimited delivery operations tied to the geographic location of the fixed based licensed operations. KAYS currently operates two Kaya Shack™ retail outlets (one in South Salem and one in Portland), and is in the process of targeting its third license to operate a Kaya Farm Store and Delivery Hub to service the Southern Oregon Market.
 
The Company has developed its own proprietary Kaya Farms™ strains of cannabis, which it has grown and produced at the various medical and recreational grows that the Company has operated and maintained over the past seven years in Oregon.
 
The Company is currently applying for a new Cannabis Processing License for its 12,000 square foot Cannabis Processing and Cannaceutical Facility in Eugene, Oregon which KAYS acquired in October 2018.

Additionally, the Company also owns a 26-acre parcel in Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon, which it purchased in August 2017 on which it intends to construct a cannabis cultivation complex, which will initially consist of an 85,000-square foot Kaya Farms™ Greenhouse Grow and Production Facility. The Company has received county zoning approvals for the complex, and has recently been notified by the OLCC that they are ready to proceed with KAYS Production (Grow) Licensing for the Linn County Facility pending completion of initial construction.


Kaya Brands USA
 
Kaya Brands USA, Inc. (“KBUS”) was recently incorporated to manage and leverage the intellectual property associated with the Kaya family of brands and seek out US based projects and ventures to enhance shareholder value associated with their development.
 
KBUS presently manages 18 proprietary brands formulated and developed by the Company which includes the Kaya Shack™ retail brand, the Kaya Farms™ cultivation brand, and the Kaya Gear™ apparel brand, as well as a host of carefully developed cannabis and CBD products that include cannabis extracts and concentrates, vape cartridges, chocolates, gummies and chews, topicals and creams, beverages, foods, and cannaceuticals.
 
Kaya Brands International and International Plans for Expansion
 
Kaya has recently implemented a strategic shift away from the U.S. cannabis market, its initial intended focus, placing current expansion emphasis on international opportunities and brand extensions. While the US Cannabis markets are receiving a strong tail wind from the recent change in administration and the fact that US Cannabis Banking and Taxation Laws and Regulations are forecast to become more industry friendly, KAYS believes that it will still be some years until such time that the Federal Laws allow for Interstate Cannabis Commerce and true economies of scale to develop within the emerging U.S. Cannabis Markets. Thus, KAYS has developed an exciting international growth program with the potential for strategic position and growth, all the while remaining prepared for the eventuality of a more inviting U.S. market.
 
Kaya Brands International, Inc. (“KBI”) was incorporated in late 2019 to serve as the Company’s vehicle for expansion into worldwide cannabis markets. KBI is seeking to leverage the other product brands for development of the Kaya Shack™ retail and Kaya Farms™ brands in Europe and elsewhere as opportunities permit. Projects currently under development include licensing of the Kaya Shack™ retail brand for franchising in Canada and licensing of the Kaya Farms™ brand to develop cultivation projects in Greece, Israel and other potential locations.
 
This segregation of US and foreign based activities would allow for KAYS to eventually have KBI listed on a recognized securities exchange such as the OTCQX, NASDAQ or NYSE in the US, the Canadian Securities Exchange or “CSE” in Canada (a Canadian Exchange that has proven to be an excellent source of new institutional and retail investment capital and liquidity for both Canadian and U.S.-based OTC cannabis stocks) or other such international exchange that would allow KBI to access additional capital not currently available through US over-the counter (“OTC”) markets.
 
KAYS intends to maintain a majority ownership of KBI, but is also working on plans to issue a dividend of common shares in KBI to shareholders of record at a date to be determined by the Board of Directors of KAYS.
 
Additionally, KAYS intends to structure KBI’s participation in projects that would lead to these projects eventually seeking their own public company status and corresponding issuance of securities which could potentially significantly enhance the value of KAYS/KBI’s investment and possibly lead to dividends for KAYS/KBI’s shareholders. There can be no assurance given as to whether or when KAYS will be able to do so, or it would ultimately be successful in increasing shareholder value.

The Global Cannabis Industry
 
New Frontier Data estimates the existing global demand for cannabis to be $344.4 billion USD, using consumption levels and market prices to reach their estimate. The illicit market, with the exception of the relatively few countries that regulate and license cultivation or importation of cannabis, meets the vast majority of global demand for cannabis.
 
There are an estimated 263 million people globally who can be classified as cannabis consumers, demonstrating significant demand for the medical, wellness, and recreational uses of cannabis. The strength of demand varies by region and depends heavily on the status of legalization, levels of social acceptance, and access to cannabis. There are an estimated 1.2 billion people worldwide suffering from medical conditions for which cannabis has shown therapeutic value.
 
There are currently 55 countries with legalized cannabis for medical use. The regulatory framework varies by country and may differ in rules for qualifying conditions, physician participation, production and processing, accepted delivery systems, insurance payment participation, and potency permitted. The stringency of the rules typically has a significant impact on the size, growth, and reach of each program.
 
Canada and Uruguay are the first two nations with legal recreational cannabis, with a few other nations set to follow, including South Africa, Georgia and Mexico. The aim of the legal programs is to transition the illicit market to the legal, regulated and taxable markets.  Canadian companies were the first to create global cannabis infrastructure and are poised to compete with other emerging export centers, including Israel, Greece and Colombia.
 
The United States has been the global leader in cannabis innovation, including new genetics, cultivation techniques, derivative products, and delivery methods. U.S. based companies are beginning to move into the global arena.
 
The opportunity represented by legal cannabis is significant, but many countries limit the number of legal participants and have regulatory policies that are still evolving, leading to high overall risk and barriers to entry.
 
As governments in newly legalized markets lay the foundations for their nascent industries, many lack or do not wish to regulate domestic cultivation and production activity. This forms the foundation for a vibrant international cannabis import-export sector.
 
North America
 
North America, according to New Frontier Data, represents a total cannabis demand (legal & illicit) valued at $86 billion USD.
 
The United States and Canada have been leading the global legal cannabis movement, which in turn impacts the way governments worldwide are structuring the regulation of legal cannabis in their own countries.
Canada
 
Canada is the first G-7 nation to fully legalize cannabis for medical and recreational use. The legal structure has given rise to large Canadian cannabis companies that have achieved high valuations, which they have leveraged to purchase supply chain companies and invest in infrastructure projects to produce cannabis at costs lower than those in Canada.
 
To date, Canadian companies report exporting only several thousands of pounds of cannabis to more than 20 different countries, collectively – demonstrating the early stage of development of the global cannabis market, and by extension the remaining opportunities.

The United States
 
 New Frontier Data forecasts that the legal U.S. markets will generate nearly $19 billion in legal sales in 2020, growing to over $20 billion by 2022.
 
Cannabis remains federally illegal in the United States, even as support for legal recreational cannabis remains above 60% in most reputable polls. Regardless of the federal status of cannabis, currently 33 U.S. states have enacted laws legalizing some form of medical cannabis, and 10 states and the District of Colombia have legalized recreational use cannabis. The United States has been the global leader in cannabis innovation, including new genetics, cultivation techniques, derivative products, and delivery methods.
States with some type of legal medical cannabis laws include Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Missouri, Maryland, Montana, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. States permitted the sales of recreational or “adult-use” cannabis are Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. The District of Colombia (Washington D.C.) also permits adult-use cannabis.


Europe
 
New Frontier Data estimates the European cannabis market (legal & illicit) generates $69 billion USD annually, with France, Italy and Spain having the greatest number of cannabis consumers, and Germany with the most robust medical program to date. 
 
With the U.S. political shift creating federal U.S. legalization optimism, the U.S. marijuana market is projected to grow to $30-$37 billion by 2024. On the other hand, with over twice the population of the U.S. and Canada combined, Europe’s cannabis market is projected to reach $146.37 billion by 2028.
 
There are almost 30 European countries that permit some form of legal medical cannabis including, France, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Czech Republic, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Israel, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Turkey, Ireland, Lithuania and Portugal. The European Union requires its member countries to enforce the European Union Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which detail the production standards for medicinal products. These standards are typically stringent and can be costly for cannabis companies.


Israel and Greece
 
Israel has a small population but a long established history of legal medical cannabis development. It continues as a leader with years in the development of cannabis pharmaceuticals, and together with Greece the 2 are projected to form a “Silicon Valley” network for the development of medical cannabis production to service the European Markets and beyond.

The Kaya Shack™ Brand
 

Kaya Holdings operates the Kaya Shack™ brand of legal medical and recreational retail marijuana retail stores. Kaya Holdings operates two recreational marijuana retail outlets and medical marijuana dispensaries in Oregon under the Kaya Shack™ brand.
 
Additionally, Kaya Holdings maintains an active third OLCC Marijuana Retail License which it is seeking to move to its Eugene, Oregon Kaya Farms Indoor Production and Processing Facility so that the Company may offer a “Kaya Farm Store” and also serve as a retail delivery hub for Eugene, Oregon.
 
Dubbed by the mainstream press as the “Starbucks of Marijuana” after our first outlet opened in July 2014, our operating concept is simple: to deliver a consistent customer experience (quality products, fair prices and superior customer service) to a broad and diverse base of customers. Kaya Shack™ meets the quality needs of the “marijuana enthusiast”, the comfort and atmosphere of all including “soccer moms” and the price sensitivities of casual smokers.


The Kaya Shack™ brand communicates positive thinking and joy, with signs adorning the walls that read “It’s a Good Day to have a Good Day,” “Some of our Happiest Days Haven’t Even Happened Yet,” and our signature “Be Kind.”
 
Kaya Shack™ retail outlets are open 7 days a week- Monday through Saturday from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm, and Sunday 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Operations follow an operational manual that details procedures for 18 areas of operation including safety, compliance, store opening, store closing, merchandising, handling of cash, inventory control, product intake, store appearance and employee conduct.
 
In compliance with regulations, all marijuana and marijuana infused products sold through our stores are quality tested by independent labs to assure adherence to strict quality and OLCC regulations.
 
The Company is exploring opportunities to expand its operations beyond Oregon by replicating its Kaya Shack™ brand retail outlets through franchising in other states where medial and or recreational cannabis use is legal or expected to become legal in the near term, as well as in Canada, Greece and Israel, as part of KAYS International Expansion Plans. KAYS also is targeting opening corporate owned marijuana production and processing facilities to support the envisioned franchised outlets, and to both maintain quality control and offer customers a consistent customer experience while reducing costs of goods to franchisees.

Kaya Shack™ Retail Outlets
 

All stores feature a check out stand wrapped to feature the Company’s proprietary brand of pre-rolls, Kaya Buddies. The Buddies program is an exciting and popular pre-roll offering, featuring a wide selection (15-15 strains of pre-rolls) and featuring our special Kaya Saying in each Buddies tube. A glass display case showcases at least 25 strains of marijuana flower, which the stores serve to customers “deli style”, weighing straight from the jar to the customer’s take-out tube. An additional display case with a varied selection of oils, concentrates and topicals rounds out the cannabis product display.

The stores also feature standing display cases with cannabis intended glassware under the Company’s brand Really Happy Glass, as well as a rack of proprietary t-shirt designs marketed under the Company brand Kaya Gear. The store also has a hospitality area that offers free water, coffee, tea and hot cocoa. As required by law, all products containing marijuana are either behind locked glass or behind the counter and out of customer reach.

I. Kaya Shack™ , 1719 SE Hawthorne Blvd., Portland, Oregon. 
 
Our first Kaya Shack™ OLCC licensed marijuana store (located in the heart of the trendy Hawthorne district in southeast Portland, the “Greenwich Village” of the West Coast) opened for business July 03, 2014. The store is located next door to a cell phone repair shop, and near to Devil’s Dill restaurant and No Fun pub. There are also a McMenamins restaurant, tattoo parlor, convenience store, hair/nail salon and a soccer sports bar. The area around the shop is mixed use (commercial and residential) and has a footprint of approximately 700 square feet and is the model for the Company’s small urban shops.

  II. Kaya Shack ™ Marijuana Superstore, South Salem, Oregon. 
 


Our second Kaya Shack™ OLCC licensed marijuana store (located in South Salem, Oregon) opened for business on October 17, 2015. The store is located in a strip mall alongside a Caesar’s Pizza, Aaron’s furniture, a convenience store, a tanning salon, and a nail salon. The plaza also has a Subway, a sports bar and a laundromat. The area around the shop is primarily commercial with residential complexes under construction and has a footprint of approximately 2,100 square feet and serves as the model for the Company’s superstores featuring larger display areas and a soon-to-be-opened Pakalolo Juice Company infused fresh fruit smoothies stand.

Kaya Shack™ Car Fleet and Home Delivery
 



The Company is licensed by the OLCC for home delivery for all three of its retail licenses and has a fleet of 4 Kaya Cars featuring the Company’s branding logos outfitted with safes and security equipment. We have begun to offer deliver within the geographic areas of Portland and Salem, and are looking to expand this offering to Eugene if we are able to get an approval on the transfer of our third retailer license and open up the Kaya Farm Store at our Eugene, Oregon Kaya Farms Indoor Grow, Processing & Cannaceutical Production Facility.
 
The Company has developed the website www.kayadelivers.com to advance the growth of its delivery service and to offer pre-ordering for curbside pickup in light of the coronavirus pandemic to better serve our customers.
 
We expect delivery to extend our visibility, assist in building brand awareness, and allow the Company to service a broader geographic territory.

Kaya Farms™
 

The Company has developed its own proprietary Kaya Farms™ strains of cannabis, which it has grown and produced at the various medical and recreational grows that the Company has operated and maintained over the past seven years in Oregon. Additionally, KAYS has produced a full line of cannabis concentrates and extracts which it has initially produced through third party manufacturers and marketed at the Kaya Shack Stores, along with the very popular Kaya Buddies line of strain specific cannabis cigarettes.
 
Please see the following pages for an overview of our current properties in Oregon which details their history, current status and intended development, as well as pictures of our crops and testing results for some of the cannabis and cannabis products in our strain library.

Kaya Farms™
 
Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon Marijuana Grow and Manufacturing Complex



In early 2015, KAYS commenced its own medical marijuana grow operations for the cultivation and harvesting of legal marijuana thereby becoming the first publicly traded U.S. company to own a majority interest in a vertically integrated legal marijuana enterprise in the United States. Since that time KAYS has operated various grow facilities to feed the Kaya Shack Supply Chain, and in August 2017, KAYS acquired its first property for a large scale facility- a 26-acre parcel in Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon, where we intend to develop an 85,000-square foot Kaya Farms™ facility.

15
--

 



We filed for zoning and land use approval in early 2018, and after numerous regulatory challenges and delays, we finally received zoning and land use approval in early 2019 to build on the property. We are presently in the final planning stages and are awaiting the culmination of the OLCC licensing process to begin construction.
 
Management believes that the acquisition and development of the property will position the Company for future growth and expansion, including increased Marijuana Canopy production to the maximum extent allowed by law through use of both greenhouse and outdoor grows.
 
Under present laws the property can easily deliver 6-8,000 pounds of cannabis each year; if future regulations permit this capacity could easily be increased to over 100,000 pounds of cannabis per year.
 
When Federal Prohibition of marijuana ends and national and international cannabis trade can begin, we believe that Oregon is uniquely positioned to become America’s “pot basket” due to its superior climate and state history involving generations of Oregonian Cannabis Growers; ideal weather + extensive generational knowledge = superior, lower cost cannabis products for export.

Kaya Farms Indoor Marijuana Grow, Processing & Cannaceutical Production Facility



On October 23, 2018 KAYS announced that it had concluded the purchase of the real property and associated equipment utilized by the Eugene, Oregon based Sunstone Farms grow and manufacturing facility, which is licensed by the OLCC for both the production (growing) of medical and recreational marijuana flower and the processing of cannabis concentrates/extracts/edibles. The purchase included a 12,000 square foot building housing equipment for growing and extraction activity.
 
The purchase price of $1.3 was paid for by the issuance of 12 million shares of KAYS restricted stock to the seller at closing. Additionally, the seller purchased 2.5 million restricted shares for $250,000 in cash in a private transaction with the Company, and became a Board Member of Kaya Holdings. While the shares carried a lock-up-restriction allowing for their staged eligibility for resale over a 61-month period from the date of the purchase of the facility by KAYS, none of the shares have been submitted for resale.
 
As the OLCC deemed that the licenses that were part and parcel of the purchase were ultimately non-transferrable to KAYS by Sunstone, the Company recently negotiated a settlement with the seller that allows KAYA to retain ownership of the facility, for the return of all shares issued to the seller as part of the transaction (the 12 million shares for the facility purchase, the 2.5 million shares issued for $250,000.00, and subsequent shares issued as annual compensation for Board Member Compensation) in exchange for allowing the seller to retain the proceeds of the sale of the grow license to an unrelated third party that is in process of obtaining approvals from the OLCC to relocate it to another location, as well as provides for the seller to resign from the Board of Kaya Holdings and work as a non-exclusive consultant to the Company for the next 48 months for a total four year fee of $140,000.
 
As part of a larger production and processing plan that would allow for a more efficient Production and Processing plan and economy of scale, the Company is presently in the process of submitting a new OLCC Marijuana Processing License for the 12,000 facility, and plans to renovate and dedicate the facility to produce various brands of oils, edibles, concentrates and extracts, and develop medical grade laboratory facilities for the production of a proprietary Kaya Cannaceuticals™, while conductingall future grow operations at the Lebanon Kaya Farms Ag Facility upon completion of construction and licensing.

Kaya Buddie™ Strain Specific Cannabis Cigarettes





In 2016 the Company introduced a signature line of strain-specific connoisseur-grade, pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes branded as “Kaya Buddies™”. Kaya Buddies™ cannabis cigarettes have been very well received by medical patients and recreational users, with the Company selling over 100,000 Kaya Buddies™ since launching the brand in January 2016. The brand, marketed under the tagline “Buds with Benefits”, features over 50 different strains of connoisseur-grade, high quality cannabis and proprietary specialty blends. Many cannabis retailers produce prerolls, but none that we know of offer strain specific preroll made from the buds of the flower.

Kaya Brands International
 

After over five years of conducting “touch the plant” U.S. cannabis operations inside the strict regulatory confines of a public company, KAYS has formed Kaya Brands International, Inc. (“Kaya International” or “KBI”), to leverage its experience and expand into worldwide cannabis markets. KBI’s current operations and initiatives include Canada Greece, and Israel, with additional areas under consideration for Mexico, Uruguay and Zimbabwe.
Canada
 





Canadian Franchising:  KAYS has endeavored to launch its franchise program and growth strategy in Canada. To this end, the Company has retained the Toronto based law firm of Garfinkle Biderman LLP to prepare the legal infrastructure required to enable the Company to sell Kaya Shack™ franchises in Canada.
 
Garfinkle Biderman has since completed the necessary legal work and the Company is currently in negotiations with different potential development partners to launch franchised operations in Canada and hopes to establish up to 100 franchised locations there over the next five years.

Kaya Kannabis Medical Cannabis Production Facility in Thebes, Greece (Project Design Rendering)
 
Current Project Status & Developmental Timeline
 
On October 31, 2019 KAYS entered into an initial Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) setting forth an agreement in principle for KBI to acquire a 50% ownership interest in GKC, pursuant to which in consideration for KBI providing the necessary expertise related to cannabis cultivation, processing, brand development and other matters, KBI would have the right to acquire a 50% ownership interest in GKC by reimbursing GKC for 50% of its license application costs (with allowances for KBI’s expenses as well).
 
On April 22, 2020 KAYS/KBI received confirmation from their Greek Counsel that the Greek Government had awarded the crucial Installation License for the project. There are three licenses required for the Facility- an “Installation License” (which is the equivalent to a license to construct the facility), the “Operating License” (available only after construction is completed), and the “Production & Distribution License” (available from the EOF - the Greek equivalent to the U.S. FDA - once production can be evaluated).
 
On January 13, 2021 KAYS reported that its majority-owned subsidiary KBI had exercised its option to acquire a 50% Interest in GKC:
 
KBI acquired an initial 25% interest in GKC through a share purchase agreement with existing shareholders of GKC, which was consummated as of December31, 2020.
 
The remaining 25% interest is in process of being issued to KBI for a minor amount of paid in capital in recognition of KAYS and KBI’s contributions to the project.
 
The acquisition of the 50% interest in GKC is the cornerstone of KAYS’ planned Kaya Kannabis project, announced in late 2019 with the objective of establishing a beachhead to enter the lucrative global medical cannabis market from Greece, a member of the European Union.
 
On January 21, 2021 KAYS announced that the Joint Venture has named Dimitris Bouras the Lead Engineer, and his firm, Whitestone MCI, the Chief Engineering Group for the development and construction of the Company's planned cannabis cultivation and processing facility in Thebes, Greece:
 
Dimitris Bouras has successfully been planning and constructing large engineering projects internationally for 30 years, and serves as the CEO of Whitestone, a firm founded in 2008 that is active in engineering, design, construction and O&M of industrial, marine and commercial projects. Whitestone MCI has been active in the Medical & Industrial Cannabis Industry since 2017 and is a leading Engineering & EPC Contracting Company that offers total project development services to GACP/EU GMP Standards. Whitestone MCI currently has active projects in Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, North Macedonia, Poland and Africa.
 
On February 1, 2021 KAYS reported that the joint venture had engaged Dutch based Orange Ridge Capital B.V. (“Orange Ridge”) to raise up to $45 million for its planned 15-acre cannabis cultivation and processing facility in Thebes, Greece:
  Orange Ridge Capital B.V. ("Orange Ridge") is registered at the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM: Autoriteit Financiele Markten) and is registered as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (an "AIFMD") with the Dutch Supervisory Authority in The Netherlands. Orange Ridge has comprehensive expertise in sustainable real asset investments that require significant due diligence and technical expertise, access to capital, and local partnerships in strategic locations.
 
As an AIFMD, Orange Ridge's mission is to generate attractive investment returns from high-quality sustainable real assets such as timberland, farmland, agriculture, infrastructure, real estate, and renewable energy in Europe, the Americas, and Australasia, and provides these sustainable real asset investment solutions and strategies to a wide range of clients in Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas, such as pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, and investment consultants.

Kaya Shalvah is the Israeli-based cultivation-for-export project cannabis farming project of U.S. based Kaya Brands International, Inc (“KBI”), a majority owned subsidiary of Kaya Holdings, Inc.



 Kaya Shalvah Cannabis Production Facility, Greenegeve Cannabis Ecosystem, Yerucham, Isreal (Project Design Rendering)
 
Project Description
 
Kaya Shalvah will, at full capacity, comprise twenty light deprivation greenhouses, each 35,000 sq. feet (approximately 3,500 sq. meters), situated on 25 acres of land, and supported by an additional 80,000 sq. feet (approximately 8,000 sq. meters) structure for workspace, storage and administrative offices.
 
Under this model the farm will support 9,360 plants per greenhouse (for a full-capacity total plant count of 187,200 plants). There will be four harvests each year for a total of 748,800 cannabis plants harvested annually. The Company estimates total farm production, once completely constructed and operating at full capacity, to be at least 374,400 pounds (169,825 kilos) of premium grade cannabis annually. The targeted land is in Yerucham, Israel approximately 90 minutes from Tel Aviv.
 
Project Location- Greenegev Cannabis Ecosystem, Yerucham, Israel
 
Why Israel, and Why Yerucham
 
Among Israel’s chief advantages, alongside its compatible climate, are its tradition of agricultural sophistication and its status as perhaps the world’s premier cannabis research center. Israel has been a pioneer in cannabis R&D for several decades, and has one of the highest per capita rates of medical cannabis patients in the world. Yerucham has a Development Zone A designation from the Israeli government, making economic growth in the area a national priority and attaching a wide range of financial incentives to companies therein establishing operations.
 
Under the leadership of its Mayor, Tal Ohana, Yerucham has embarked on a program to transform the small desert town into “Greenegev”, the first cannabinoid ecosystem in Israel. The plans call for cultivation, processing and research companies to concentrate their respective activities in Yerucham, attracting services that provide each resident company with core advantages by virtue of the cooperation and support the ecosystem community is uniquely positioned to provide.
 
The Company meets all the prescribed criteria and the licensing process is progressing, with the full support and valuable assistance of the Yerucham mayor’s office and the municipal staff. The Company is also benefitting from the support and guidance of Major General (Res.) Amram Mitzna, a former Yerucham mayor and the current chairman of the Yerucham Fund. Yerucham has a Development Zone A designation from the Israeli government, making economic growth in the area a national priority and attaching a wide range of financial incentives to companies therein establishing operations. The process is estimated to take between 6-9 months. The Company anticipates receiving its license in early 2021, subject to final acquisition of the land.

Current Licensing & Project Status
 
In late 2019 and early 2020, KBI retained the services of the Tel Aviv based law firms Zysman, Aharoni, Gayer and Sullivan Law, respectively, to assist the Company in obtaining an Israeli medical cannabis cultivation license and an Israeli license to export medical cannabis. Part of this process included the establishment of our entity to do business in Israel (Kaya Shalvah) as well as building out Kaya Shalvah’s Board of Directors and Board of Advisors (biographies listed below).
 
In early and mid 2020, the Company, through its attorneys, worked to prepare the requisite paperwork for its cannabis cultivation license application. On November 30, 2020 the Company submitted its application for its initial cannabis cultivation license to the Ministry of Health, Division of Medical Cannabis, and was advised that the review process would take 3 to 6 months.
 
As of March 20, 2021, our attorneys advised that the license was in its final stage of approval (having completed the review and screening process as an International Company applying for a cannabis license in Israel), and that the process should be completed shortly and the license issued.
 
Once the Company receives the license, the Company will submit its land acquisition bid for 100 Dunams (approximately 25 acres) of land to the Israel Land Authority, which is processing applications for the land bids that are part of the highly sought after Greenegez Canabis Center in Yerucham, Israel.
 
Potential Markets
 
The Company has ongoing discussions with a number of European cannabis distribution companies in an effort to sign non-exclusive supply/sales agreements for all or part of the Company’s yield, in accordance with agreed upon parameters. The Company also expects to target sales in Asia, South America, and additional markets as the global legalization of cannabis progresses. Additionally, the Company is in preliminary discussions with current medical marijuana dispensary license operators in Israel about franchising the Kaya Shack, as well as working with other medical marijuana companies on joint ventures and acquisitions.

We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws directly applicable to our operations. As we continue to expand the scope of our operations, the application of existing laws and regulations could include matters such as pricing, advertising, consumer protection, quality of products, and intellectual property ownership. In addition, we will also be subject to new laws and regulations directly applicable to our activities.
 
Any existing or new legislation applicable to us could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, which could hinder or prevent the growth of our business.
 
Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing legal recreational and medical marijuana use are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance. In addition, violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our planned business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that additional or revised federal, state and local laws and regulations may be enacted in the future governing the legal marijuana industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with any such laws and regulations and its failure to do so could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Competition
 
The legal marijuana sector is rapidly growing and the Company faces significant competition in the operation of retail outlets, MMDs and grow facilities. Many of these competitors will have far greater experience, more extensive industry contacts and greater financial resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that we can adequately compete to succeed in our business plan.
Employees
 
As of the date as of this Report, our Oregon operations have a total of 12-15 part-time store employees including budtenders, trimmers, growers, and4 full-time employees, consisting of the Senior Vice President of Cannabis Operations, the Vice President of Marketing and Brand development, and 2 store managers.

Additional employees will be hired and other consultants engaged in the future as our business expands.
 
Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business
 
The adverse public health developments and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and overseas could adversely affect the Company’s customers and suppliers as a result of quarantines, facility closures and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak. More broadly, the COVID-19 pandemic could potentially lead to an extended economic downturn, which would likely decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our products and services, slow our international expansion plans, harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company cannot accurately predict the effect the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company.
