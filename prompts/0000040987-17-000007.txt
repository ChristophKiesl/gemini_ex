AUTOMOTIVE PARTS GROUP
The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company, distributes automotive parts and accessory items. In addition to approximately 500,000 available part numbers, the Company offers complete inventory, cataloging, marketing, training and other programs in the automotive aftermarket. The Company is the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association (“NAPA”), a voluntary trade association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts.
During 2016, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included NAPA automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores (“auto parts stores” or “NAPA AUTO PARTS stores”) owned and operated in the United States by the Company; NAPA and Traction automotive parts distribution centers and auto parts stores in the United States and Canada owned and operated by the Company and NAPA Canada/UAP Inc. (“NAPA Canada/UAP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; auto parts stores and distribution centers in the United States operated by corporations in which the Company owned either a noncontrolling or controlling interest; auto parts stores in Canada operated by corporations in which UAP owns a 50% interest; Repco and other automotive parts distribution centers, branches and auto parts stores in Australia and New Zealand owned and operated by GPC Asia Pacific, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; import automotive parts distribution centers in the United States owned by the Company and operated by its Altrom America division; import automotive parts distribution centers in Canada owned and operated by Altrom Canada Corporation (“Altrom Canada”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; distribution centers in the United States owned by Balkamp, Inc. (“Balkamp”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; distribution facilities in the United States owned by the Company and operated by its Rayloc division; automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores in Mexico, owned and operated by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de C.V. (“Auto Todo”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; and an automotive parts distribution center and automotive parts stores in Mexico, owned and operated by Autopartes NAPA Mexico ("NAPA Mexico"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
The Company's network of U.S. automotive parts stores was expanded in 2016 via the acquisition of various store groups located in various regions of the United States. Further, the Company's import automotive parts businesses were supplemented by the acquisitions of Olympus and Auto-Camping in February and July, 2016, respectively. As original equipment import parts distributors, Olympus operates in the U.S. from six locations, while Auto-Camping operates from 20 locations across Canada. Additionally, the Company added six new locations to its heavy vehicle parts operations with the acquisition of Global Parts in May 2016. Finally, the GPC Asia Pacific automotive business acquired three businesses in 2016 to further expand its automotive distribution network. In March, this business acquired Covs Parts, a leading distributor of original equipment and aftermarket automotive parts, mining and industrial consumable and truck products, with 21 locations across Western Australia. GPC Asia Pac also acquired AMX and ASL in June and September 2016, respectively. AMX is a four store Melbourne based

retailer of aftermarket motorcycle parts and accessories, which complements the existing McLeod business. ASL is a 15 branch New Zealand based distributor of automotive aftermarket products, primarily to the commercial industry. Collectively, these new store groups and automotive businesses are expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $235 million USD.
The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information Corporation (“MRIC”), a subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading automotive diagnostic and repair information company that links North American subscribers to its services and information databases. MRIC’s core product, “Mitchell ON-DEMAND,” is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive aftermarket.
The Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle makes and models in service in the United States, including imported vehicles, trucks, SUVs, buses, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small engines, farm equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include accessory items for such vehicles and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers, farms, industrial concerns and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation. Although the Company’s domestic automotive operations purchase from approximately 100 different suppliers, approximately 48% of 2016 automotive parts inventories were purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company has had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which have protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.
Distribution System.    In 2016, the Company operated 57 domestic NAPA automotive parts distribution centers located in 41 states and approximately 1,100 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 45 states. The Company also operated domestically three TW Distribution heavy duty parts distribution centers and 20 company-owned Traction Heavy Duty parts stores located in four states. The Traction operations are discussed further below in Related Operations. At December 31, 2016, the Company owned either a noncontrolling or controlling interest in seven corporations, which operated approximately 152 auto parts stores in 12 states.
The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve approximately 4,800 independently owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located throughout the United States. NAPA AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively, sales to these independent automotive parts stores account for approximately 60% of the Company’s total U.S. Automotive sales and 23% of the Company’s total sales, with no automotive parts store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or common ownership accounting for more than 0.38% of the total sales of the Company.
NAPA Canada/UAP, founded in 1926, is a leader in the distribution and marketing of replacement parts and accessories for automobiles and trucks and is also a significant supplier to the mining and forestry industries in Canada. NAPA Canada/UAP employs approximately 3,700 people and operates a network of 9 NAPA automotive parts distribution centers, three heavy duty parts distribution centers and one fabrication/remanufacturing facility supplying approximately 595 NAPA stores and 107 Traction wholesalers. The NAPA stores and Traction wholesalers in Canada include approximately 176 company owned stores, 11 joint ventures and 25 progressive owners in which NAPA Canada/UAP owns a 50% interest and approximately 490 independently owned stores. NAPA and Traction operations supply bannered installers and independent installers in all provinces of Canada, as well as networks of service stations and repair shops operating under the banners of national accounts. UAP is a licensee of the NAPA® name in Canada.
In Canada, Altrom Canada operates four import automotive parts distribution centers and 29 branches. In the United States, Altrom America operates two import automotive parts distribution centers and six branches. These include the expanded footprints for these businesses resulting from the Auto-Camping and Olympus acquisitions discussed earlier.
In Australia and New Zealand, GPC Asia Pacific, originally established in 1922, is a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories. GPC Asia Pacific operates 11 distribution centers, 474 Repco and other banner stores and 80 branches associated with the Ashdown Ingram, Motospecs, McLeod and RDA Brakes operations. As discussed earlier, GPC Asia Pacific expanded its footprint with the 2016 acquisitions of Covs Parts, AMX and ASL. 
In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates 11 distribution centers, two auto parts stores and three tire centers. NAPA Mexico owns and operates one distribution center and 10 auto parts stores. Auto Todo and NAPA Mexico are licensees of the NAPA® name in Mexico.
Products.    Distribution centers have access to approximately 500,000 different parts and related supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are filled and shipped the same day they are received. The majority of sales are paid from statements with varied terms and conditions. The Company does not manufacture any of the products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed under the NAPA® name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA, which is

important to the sales and marketing of these products. Traction sales also include products distributed under the HD Plus name, a proprietary line of automotive parts for the heavy duty truck market.
Related Operations.    Balkamp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and accessory items for passenger cars, heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm equipment. In addition, Balkamp distributes service items such as testing equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning supplies, chemicals and supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms and institutions. Balkamp packages many of the 42,000 products, which constitute the “Balkamp” line of products that are distributed through the NAPA system. These products are categorized into over 238 different product categories purchased from approximately 438 domestic suppliers and over 100 foreign manufacturers. Balkamp has two distribution centers located in Plainfield, Indiana, and West Jordan, Utah. In addition, Balkamp operates two redistribution centers that provide the NAPA system with over 1,125 SKUs of oils and chemicals. BALKAMP®, a federally registered trademark, is important to the sales and marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization.
The Company, through its Rayloc division, operates four facilities where certain small automotive parts are distributed through the NAPA system under the NAPA® brand name. Rayloc® is a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA.
The Company’s Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates as TW Distribution, with three heavy vehicle automotive parts distribution centers and 27 Traction Heavy Duty parts stores in the United States. Twenty of these stores are company-owned and seven are independently owned. This group, which expanded its U.S. footprint with the acquisition of Global Parts in 2016, as discussed earlier, distributes heavy vehicle parts through the NAPA system and direct to small and large fleet owners and operators.
Segment Data.    In the year ended December 31, 2016, sales from the Automotive Parts Group were approximately 53% of the Company’s net sales, as compared to 52% in 2015 and 53% in 2014. For additional segment information, see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1.
Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores.    The Company believes that the quality and the range of services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery, parts cataloging (including the use of electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which, as initiated by the Company from time to time, allows independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The Company offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and retirement benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs. Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS® (Total Automotive Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the Company for the NAPA AUTO PARTS stores.
The Company has developed and refined an inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous analytical review, is an integral part of the Company’s inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management services that the Company makes available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last 25 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence have been insignificant and the Company attributes this to the successful operation of its classification system, which involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers.
Competition.    The automotive parts distribution business is highly competitive. The Company competes with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive parts retail chains. In addition, the Company competes with the distributing outlets of parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers (including national retail chains), and with other parts distributors and retailers. The Automotive Parts Group competes primarily on product offering, service, brand recognition and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.”
NAPA.    The Company is the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a voluntary association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association whose sole member in 2016 owned and operated 57 distribution centers located throughout the United States. NAPA develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used by its members which, at December 31, 2016, includes only the Company. It is not involved in the chain of distribution.
Among the automotive products purchased by the Company from various manufacturers for distribution are certain lines designated, cataloged, advertised and promoted as “NAPA” lines. Generally, the Company is not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts so designated and it may, and does, purchase competitive lines from the same as well as other supply sources.

The Company uses the federally registered trademark NAPA® as part of the trade name of its distribution centers and parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s national advertising program, which is designed to increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines.
The Company is a party, together with the former members of NAPA, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements with manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among the Company and former NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting parts customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers.

Motion services all manufacturing and processing industries with access to a database of 6.9 million parts. Additionally, Motion provides U.S. government agencies access to approximately 400,000 products and replacement parts through a Government Services Administration (GSA) schedule.
Effective March 1, 2016, Motion enhanced its product and service offering with the acquisition of two complementary industrial distribution companies, Epperson and Company and Missouri Power Transmission. Epperson and Company, with three locations and based in Tampa, Florida, specializes in material handling products and services. Missouri Power Transmission, with 15 locations and based in St. Louis, Missouri, distributes power transmission equipment and industrial supplies. Combined, these two companies are expected to generate approximately $50 million in annual revenues.
In 2016, the Industrial Parts Group also acquired Colmar Belting Company and OBBCO Safety and Supply. Colmar Belting, acquired April 1, 2016, and located in South Boston, Massachusetts, is a distributor of belting, bearing and power transmission products. OBBCO Safety and Supply, acquired August 1, 2016, is a Chesapeake, Virginia, based industrial safety supply distributor. Combined, we expect Colmar and OBBCO to generate approximately $30 million in annual revenues.
Effective October 1, 2016, Motion acquired Braas Company, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota based distributor of products and services for industrial automation and control, specializing in pneumatics, motion control, industrial networking, machine safety, robotics and related industrial parts. With five sales offices and three stocking branches, we expect Braas to generate annual revenues of approximately $90 million.
The Industrial Parts Group provides customers with supply chain efficiencies achieved through the Company’s Inventory Management Solutions offering. This service provides inventory management, asset repair and tracking, vendor managed inventory commonly referred to as VMI, as well as RFID asset management of the customer’s inventory. Motion’s Energy Services Team routinely performs in-plant surveys and assessments, helping customers reduce their energy consumption and finding opportunities for improved sustainability, ultimately helping customers operate more profitably. Motion also provides a wide range of services and repairs such as: gearbox and fluid power assembly repair, process pump assembly and repair, hydraulic drive shaft repair, electrical panel assembly and repair, hose and gasket manufacture and assembly, as well as many other value-added services. A highly developed supply chain with vendor partnerships and connectivity are enhanced by Motion’s leading e-business capabilities, such as MiSupplierConnect, which provides integration between the Company’s information technology network and suppliers’ systems, creating numerous benefits for both the supplier and customer. These services and supply chain efficiencies assist Motion in meeting the cost savings that many of its customers require and expect.
Distribution System.    In North America, the Industrial Parts Group operated 483 branches, 13 distribution centers and 43 service centers as of December 31, 2016. The distribution centers stock and distribute more than 275,000 different items purchased from more than 1,050 different suppliers. The service centers provide hydraulic, hose and mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately 45% of total industrial product purchases in 2016 were made from 10 major suppliers.

Most branches have warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory representative of the products used by customers in the respective market area served.
Products.    The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of parts and products to its customers, which are primarily industrial concerns. Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears, sprockets, speed reducers, electric motors, and industrial supplies. In recent years, Motion expanded its offering to include systems and automation products in response to the increasing sophistication of motion control and process automation for full systems integration of plant equipment. Manufacturing trends and government policies have led to opportunities in the “green” and energy-efficient product markets, focusing on product offerings such as energy-efficient motors and drives, recyclable and environmentally friendly parts and supplies. The nature of this group’s business demands the maintenance of adequate inventories and the ability to promptly meet demanding delivery requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer or used in plant and facility maintenance activities. Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all sales are on open account. Motion has ongoing purchase agreements with existing customers that represent approximately 50% of the annual sales volume.
Supply Agreements.    Non-exclusive distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been the experience of the Industrial Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent. Motion has return privileges with most of its suppliers, which have protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.
Segment Data.    In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, sales from the Company’s Industrial Parts Group approximated 30% of the Company’s net sales, as compared to 31% in 2014. For additional segment information, see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1.
Competition.    The industrial parts distribution business is highly competitive. The Industrial Parts Group competes with other distributors specializing in the distribution of such items, general line distributors and others who provide similar services. To a lesser extent, the Industrial Parts Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly to the customer. The Industrial Parts Group competes primarily on the breadth of product offerings, service and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.”
