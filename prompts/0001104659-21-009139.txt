Item 1. Business. 
Introduction 
 
We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination. We have reviewed a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.

Company History 
 
Novus Capital Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on March 5, 2020. The Company is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the “business combination”).
 
The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
 
In March 2020, we issued an aggregate of 2,875,000 shares of our common stock, (the “founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.01 per share, to our initial stockholders. In connection with the IPO, our initial stockholders forfeited 375,000 shares because the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised. In March 2020, we also issued to designees of EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EarlyBirdCapital”), the representative of the underwriters of the IPO, an aggregate of 150,000 shares of common stock (the “representative shares”) at a price of $0.0001 per share.
 
The registration statement for the Company’s IPO was declared effective on May 14, 2020. On May 19, 2020, the Company consummated the IPO of 10,000,000 units (the “units” and, with respect to the shares of common stock included in the units sold, the “public shares”) at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 3,250,000 warrants (the “private warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per private warrant in a private placement to the Company’s founding stockholders (the “initial stockholders”) and EarlyBirdCapital (together with the initial stockholders, the “founders”), generating gross proceeds of $3,250,000.
 
Following the closing of the IPO on May 19, 2020, an amount of $100,000,000 ($10.00 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the IPO and the sale of the private warrants was placed in a trust account (the “trust account”) located in the United States, and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination or (ii) the distribution of the trust account.
 
Transaction costs amounted to $2,456,726 consisting of $2,000,000 of underwriting fees and $456,726 of other offering costs.
 
Our activities since May 19, 2020, have consisted of the search and evaluation of potential targets in contemplation of a business combination. All activity for the period from March 5, 2020 (inception) through May 18, 2020 relates to the Company’s formation and the IPO, which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a business combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the IPO.
 
Proposed Business Combination
 
On September 28, 2020, Novus, Orga, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Novus, (“Merger Sub”) and AppHarvest, Inc. (“AppHarvest”) entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), pursuant to which Novus and AppHarvest will consummate the business combination. The Business Combination Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, closing conditions, termination fee provisions and other terms relating to the merger (the “Merger”) and the other transactions contemplated thereby.
 
2

 

The Merger is to become effective by the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and mutually agreed by the parties, and will be effective immediately upon such filing or upon such later time as may be agreed by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger (such time, “Effective Time”). The parties will hold the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) immediately prior to such filing of a certificate of merger, on the “Closing Date.”
 
The Effective Time shall occur as promptly as practicable but in no event later than three business day after the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions to the completion of the business combination set forth in the Business Combination Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, provided that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver at the Closing).
 
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, AppHarvest shall cause each share of AppHarvest preferred stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be automatically converted into a number of shares of AppHarvest common stock at the then effective conversion rate as calculated pursuant to AppHarvest’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. All of the shares of AppHarvest preferred stock converted into shares of AppHarvest common stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of AppHarvest preferred stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities.
 
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Novus shall assume the AppHarvest interim period convertible notes with an aggregate principal balance of $30.0 million (the “AppHarvest Interim Period Convertible Notes”) and cause the outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest due on such AppHarvest Interim Period Convertible Notes outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be automatically converted into a number of shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $9.50 per share, and such converted AppHarvest Interim Period Convertible Notes will no longer be outstanding and will cease to exist. All of the AppHarvest Interim Period Convertible Notes converted into shares of our common stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, any liens securing obligations under the AppHarvest Interim Period Convertible Notes shall be released and each holder of AppHarvest Interim Period Convertible Notes shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities.
 
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Novus, Merger Sub, AppHarvest or the holders of any of AppHarvest’s securities:
 
• Each share of AppHarvest common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares of AppHarvest common stock resulting from the conversion of AppHarvest preferred stock and shares of AppHarvest common stock subject to forfeiture restrictions or other restrictions issued pursuant to the AppHarvest, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”) or otherwise (each an “AppHarvest Restricted Share”) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the number of shares of our common stock equal to the exchange ratio provided for in the Business Combination Agreement (the “Exchange Ratio”); provided, however, that each share of our common stock issued in exchange for AppHarvest Restricted Shares shall be subject to the terms and conditions giving rise to a substantial risk of forfeiture that applied to such AppHarvest Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent consistent with the terms of such AppHarvest Restricted Shares;
 
• All shares of AppHarvest common stock and AppHarvest preferred stock held in the treasury of AppHarvest shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto;
 
• Each share of Merger Sub common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the surviving corporation;
 
• Each AppHarvest option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock (such option, an “Exchanged Option”) equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number of shares of AppHarvest common stock subject to such AppHarvest option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such AppHarvest option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio;
 
3

 

• Each award of outstanding restricted stock units to acquire shares of AppHarvest common stock immediately prior to the Closing issued pursuant to an award granted under the 2018 Plan or otherwise (each an “AppHarvest RSU”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Novus and converted into an award of restricted stock units to acquire shares of our common stock (each, a “Converted RSU Award”). Each Converted RSU Award will represent the right to acquire that number of shares of our common stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (1) the number of shares of AppHarvest common stock subject to the AppHarvest RSU award immediately before the Effective Time and (2) the Exchange Ratio; provided, that, except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Converted RSU Award shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) as were applicable to the corresponding former AppHarvest RSU award immediately prior to the Effective Time.
 
• No certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of our common stock shall be issued upon the exchange of AppHarvest common stock and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Novus or a holder of shares of our common stock. In lieu of any fractional share of our common stock to which each holder of AppHarvest common stock would otherwise be entitled, the fractional share shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole share of our common stock, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up. No cash settlements shall be made with respect to fractional shares eliminated by rounding.
 
On September 28, 2020, we executed Subscription Agreements with subscribers for the sale of an aggregate of 37,500,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $375.0 million, in a private placement (the “PIPE”). The closing of the PIPE will occur contemporaneously with the consummation of our proposed business combination. We will receive net proceeds of $354.3 million from the PIPE.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
The Nasdaq rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (less any taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.
 
We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or a newly formed subsidiary or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.
 
The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.

Conversion Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
 
Our initial stockholders and our officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly. Additionally, the holders of the representative shares will not have conversion rights with respect to the representative shares.
 
We may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.
 
Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 18 months from the closing of the IPO, or until November 19, 2021, to complete an initial business combination. If we have not completed an initial business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by November 19, 2021 unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our initial stockholders, officers, directors or any other person.
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 18th month, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 
We are required to seek to have all third parties and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Vincent Donargo, our Chief Financial Officer, has agreed that he will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that he will be able to satisfy his indemnification obligations if he is required to do so. We have not asked Mr. Donargo to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether Mr. Donargo has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that Mr. Donargo will be able to satisfy his indemnification obligations if he is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement Mr. Donargo entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors.

We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after our 18th month and anticipate it will take no more than ten business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founder shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to such shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, including the private warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Mr. Laikin has contractually agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has contractually agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.
 
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption price would be approximately $10.00 as of December 31, 2020. As discussed above, the proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
 
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period, if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to consummating an initial business combination. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after 18 months from the closing of the IPO, or November 19, 2021, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions that apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of the IPO, or November 19, 2021, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by any officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

• | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if our initial business combination is not consummated within 18 months from the IPO, or November 19, 2021, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | upon the consummation of the IPO, $100.0 million was placed into the trust account;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in the IPO on an initial business combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain Potential Conflicts of Interest Relating to Our Officers and Directors 
 
Our officers and directors are, and may in the future become, affiliated with other companies. In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from such other corporate affiliations, each of our officers and directors has contractually agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, until the earliest of our execution of a definitive agreement for a business combination, our liquidation or such time as he ceases to be an officer or director, to present to our company for our consideration, prior to presentation to any other entity, any suitable business opportunity which may reasonably be required to be presented to us, subject to any fiduciary or contractual obligations he might have.
 
Our officers and directors have agreed to present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account, subject to any fiduciary or contractual obligations they have. As more fully discussed in “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that might be attractive to any entity to which he has fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such initial business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such initial business combination opportunity to us. For more information on the relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our management team, see the section titled “Management — Conflicts of Interest.”
 
Indemnity 
 
In connection with the Merger, Vincent Donargo, the Chief Financial Officer of Novus, has agreed that he will be liable to Novus if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than Novus’s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which Novus has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below $10.00 per public share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under Novus’s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Donargo, will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. Novus has not independently verified whether Mr. Donargo has sufficient funds to satisfy his indemnity obligations and, therefore, Mr. Donargo may not be able to satisfy those obligations. Novus has not asked Mr. Donargo to reserve for such obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for Novus’s initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, Novus may not be able to complete its initial business combination, and its stockholders would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of their public shares. Except to the extent of Mr. Donargo’s indemnification obligations described above, none of Novus’s officers or directors will indemnify Novus for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 8556 Oakmont Lane, Indianapolis, IN 46260 which is provided to us by Robert J. Laikin, our Chairman, for no fee. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.

Employees 
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management may spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of an initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 
Our units, common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or international financial reporting standards as promulgated by the international accounting standards board (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the completion window. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
