Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are a medical device company focusing on the development and commercialization of our proprietary MicroNet™ stent platform technology for the treatment of complex vascular and coronary disease. A stent is an expandable “scaffold-like” device, usually constructed of a metallic material, that is inserted into an artery to expand the inside passage and improve blood flow. Our MicroNet, a micron mesh sleeve, is wrapped over a stent to provide embolic protection in stenting procedures.
 
Our CGuard™ carotid embolic prevention system (“CGuard EPS”) combines MicroNet and a self-expandable nitinol stent in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. Our CGuard EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in March 2013, and we launched its release on a limited basis in October 2014. In January 2015, a new version of CGuard, with a rapid exchange delivery system, received CE mark approval in Europe and in September 2015, we announced the full market launch of CGuard EPS in Europe. Subsequently, we launched CGuard EPS in Argentina and Colombia, and have received regulatory approval to commercialize CGuard EPS in Russia. If we receive sufficient proceeds from future financings, we plan to develop CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge), which we intend to submit for CE mark approval within three calendar quarters of receiving such proceeds. We cannot give any assurance that we will receive sufficient (or any) proceeds from any such financings or the timing of such financings, if ever. In addition, such additional financings may be costly or difficult to complete.


Our MGuard™ Prime™ Embolic Protection System (“MGuard Prime EPS”) is marketed for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes, notably acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions (bypass surgery). MGuard Prime EPS combines MicroNet with a bare-metal cobalt-chromium based stent and, together with our first generation MGuard stent combining MicroNet with a bare-metal stainless steel stent, unless otherwise indicated, we refer to both kinds of bare-metal stents as our MGuard coronary products. We market and sell MGuard Prime EPS for the treatment of coronary disease in the European Union. MGuard Prime EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in October 2010 for improving luminal diameter and providing embolic protection. However, as a result of a shift in industry preferences away from bare-metal stents in favor of drug-eluting (drug-coated) stents, in 2014 we decided to curtail further development of this product in order to focus on the development of a drug-eluting stent product, MGuard DES™. Due to limited resources, though, our efforts have been limited to testing drug-eluting stents manufactured by potential partners for compatibility with MicroNet and seeking to incorporate MicroNet onto a drug-eluting stent manufactured by a potential partner.
 
We are also developing a neurovascular flow diverter (“NGuard”), which is an endovascular device that directs blood flow away from cerebral aneurysms in order to ultimately seal the aneurysms. Our flow diverter would utilize an open cell, highly flexible metal scaffold to which MicroNet would be attached. We have completed initial pre-clinical testing of this product in both simulated bench models and standard in vivo pre-clinical models. However, as we plan to focus our resources on the further expansion of our sales and marketing activities for CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS and, provided that we have sufficient resources, the development of CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge) and its submission for CE mark approval, we do not intend to resume further development of NGuard until at least the third quarter of 2018.


We also intend to develop a pipeline of other products and additional applications by leveraging our MicroNet technology to new applications to improve peripheral vascular and neurovascular procedures, such as the treatment of the superficial femoral artery disease, vascular disease below the knee and neurovascular stenting to open diseased vessels in the brain.

Presently, none of our products may be sold or marketed in the United States.
 
During the first quarter of 2015, we implemented a cost reduction/focused spending plan. The plan had four components: (i) reducing headcount; (ii) limiting the focus of clinical and development expenses to only carotid and neurovascular products; (iii) limiting sales and marketing expenses to those related to the CGuard™ EPS stent launch; and (iv) reducing all other expenses (including conferences, travel, promotional expenses, executive cash salaries, director cash fees, rent, etc.). In addition, we decided to alter our commercial strategy by using third party distributors to drive future sales, as opposed to direct sales to hospitals and clinics, which had previously been our focus. However, we have decided to shift our commercial strategy to focus on sales of our products through local distribution partners and our own internal sales initiatives. We have begun to participate in international trade shows and industry conferences in an attempt to gain market exposure and brand recognition.


Effective as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 7, 2016, we amended our certificate of incorporation in order to effectuate a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock. All share and related option and warrant information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reduced number of shares outstanding which resulted from this action.
 
We were organized in the State of Delaware on February 29, 2008.

Our Industry 
 
Carotid
 
Carotid arteries are located on each side of the neck and provide the primary blood supply to the brain. Carotid artery disease, also called carotid artery stenosis, is a type of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) that is one of the major risk factors for ischemic stroke. In carotid artery disease, plaque accumulates in the artery walls, narrowing the artery and disrupting the blood supply to the brain. This disruption in blood supply, together with plaque debris breaking off the artery walls and traveling to the brain, are the primary causes of stroke. According to the World Heart Federation (http://www.world-heart-federation.org/cardiovascular-health/stroke/, last visited on Mar. 11, 2016), every year, 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, and nearly six million die and another five million are left permanently disabled. According to the same source, stroke is the second leading cause of disability, after dementia.
 
The potential global market value of carotid stents is approximately $500 million, approximately $300 million of which consists of the U.S. market and approximately $200 million of which consists of the rest of the world (source: JMP Securities 2014 and Cowen 2014). Carotid artery stenting is a minimally invasive treatment option for carotid artery disease and an alternative to carotid endarterectomy, where a surgeon accesses the blocked carotid artery though an incision in the neck, and then surgically removes the plaque. Endovascular techniques using stents and carotid embolic prevention system protect against plaque and debris traveling downstream, blocking off the vessel and disrupting blood flow. We believe that the use of a stent with an embolic protection system should increase the number of patients being treated since it would avoid the need for complex surgery.

Coronary
 
Physicians and patients may select from among a variety of treatments to address coronary artery disease, including pharmaceutical therapy, balloon angioplasty, stenting with bare metal or drug-eluting stents, and coronary artery bypass graft procedures, with the selection often depending upon the stage of the disease.
 
The global market value of coronary products is estimated at $5.9 billion, of which $4.2 billion is for stable angina and $1.7 billion is for acute myocardial infarctions according to Health Research International (June 2011). According to the 2014 MEDTECH OUTLOOK produced in December 2013 by BMO Capital Markets (“MEDTECH OUTLOOK”), revenues from the global coronary stent market are predicted to slightly decline, although in volume of stents the market is predicted to continue to grow. We believe the growth in volume is due to the appeal for less invasive percutaneous coronary intervention (“PCI”) procedures and advances in technology coupled with the increase in the elderly population, obesity rates and advances in technology.
 
Neurovascular
 
The neurovascular market focuses on catheter-delivered products used to treat strokes that already happened or unruptured brain aneurysms that could lead to strokes. In the latter case, coils are wound into blood vessel bulges to block blood flow entering the aneurysms to prevent the aneurysms from rupturing. Endovascular treatment of arterial aneurysm has evolved substantially over the past two decades, transitioning from an investigational therapy into routine clinical practice and ultimately emerging as the treatment of choice for many lesions (source: Medtech Ventures 2009, Aneurysm Flow Modulating Device Market). We believe that the market for aneurysm flow modulating devices is still in the embryonic stage with windows of opportunities for early entrance.
 
The current global market for the aneurysm flow modulating devices is estimated at $550 million, and the current market value of the flow diversion market segment is estimated to be $125 million. The neurovascular market includes over-the-wire, flow-guided microcatheters, guiding catheters, coil and liquid embolics, neurovascular stents and flow diversion stents. According to iData Research, the market is expected to be driven by the conversion from surgical procedures to endovascular techniques in the treatment of aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations.
 
Peripheral
 
Peripheral vascular diseases (“PVD”) are caused by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in arteries, which carry blood to organs, limbs and head. It is also known as peripheral artery occlusive disease or peripheral artery disease. It comprises diseases pertaining to both peripheral veins and peripheral arteries, affecting the peripheral and cardiac circulation in the body. PVD includes diseases outside of the heart and brain, but most times refers to the leg and foot.
 
The global market value of PVDs is estimated at $1.7 billion (source: Global Data 2011). The overall peripheral vascular devices market consists of nine different product segments: peripheral vascular stents, chronic total occlusion devices, peripheral transluminal angioplasty balloon catheters, atherectomy devices, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty guidewires, aortic stents, embolic protection devices, synthetic surgical grafts and inferior vena cava filters (source: Grand View Research 2014). Treatment modalities and methods have considerably improved during the last several years, and this trend is expected to continue (source: Global Data 2011). Stents and balloons hold the majority of the share in the peripheral vascular devices market. Peripheral stents are more often used in combination with balloon angioplasty to open the veins, so that blood can flow through the blocked veins in the body.

The growing prevalence of PVD is expected to cause increased demand for treatment options. The expansion of the elderly population is contributing to increasing incidence rates of PVD. The percentage of the global population above the age of 50 is expected to reach 17% by 2030. As the risk of developing PVD increases with age, a growing elderly population translates into a growing incidence of PVD (source: Global Data 2011). The growing global geriatric population base also triggers increasing demand for minimally invasive endovascular procedures on account of their shorter recovery time, lesser scaring and lesser chances of post-surgery infections. In addition, a growing prevalence of disease causing lifestyle factors and eating habits such as high consumption of alcohol and tobacco products is expected to boost peripheral vascular devices market demand by triggering the incidence rates of cardiac arrest, blood clotting and other vascular diseases (source: Grand View Research 2014).
 
Our Products
 
Below is a summary of our current products and products under development, and their intended applications.
 
MicroNet
 
MicroNet is our proprietary circular knitted mesh which wraps around a stent to protect patients from plaque debris flowing downstream upon deployment. MicroNet is made of a single fiber from a biocompatible polymer widely used in medical implantations. The size, or aperture, of the current MicroNet ‘pore’ is only 150-180 microns in order to maximize protection against the potentially dangerous plaque and thrombus.
CGuard – Carotid Applications
 
Our CGuard EPS combines our MicroNet mesh and a self-expandable nitinol stent (a stent that expands without balloon dilation pressure or need of an inflation balloon) in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. MicroNet is placed over and attached to an open cell nitinol metal stent platform which is designed to trap debris and emboli that can dislodge from the diseased carotid artery and potentially travel to the brain and cause a stroke. This danger is one of the greatest limitations of carotid artery stenting with conventional carotid stents and stenting methods. The CGuard EPS technology is a highly flexible stent system that conforms to the carotid anatomy.
 
We believe that our CGuard EPS design provides advantages over existing therapies in treating carotid artery stenosis, such as conventional carotid stenting and surgical endarterectomy, given the superior embolic protection characteristics provided by the MicroNet. We believe the MicroNet will provide acute embolic protection at the time of the procedure, but more importantly, we believe that CGuard EPS will provide post-procedure protection against embolic dislodgement, which can occur up to 48 hours post-procedure. It is in this post-procedure time frame that embolization is the source of post-procedural strokes in the brain. Schofer, et al. (“Late cerebral embolization after emboli-protected carotid artery stenting assessed by sequential diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging,” Journal of American College of Cardiology Cardiovascular Interventions, Volume 1, 2008) have shown that the majority of the incidents of embolic showers associated with carotid stenting occur post-procedure.
 
Our CGuard EPS with over-the-wire delivery system received CE mark approval in the European Union in March 2013. In October 2014, we initiated a limited market release of CGuard EPS with over-the-wire delivery system for use in carotid artery applications in Germany, Poland and Italy.
 
In September 2014, we reported the results of the CGuard CARENET trial at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (“TCT”) conference in Washington D.C. In the CARENET trial, the CGuard EPS system demonstrated better results over historical data using conventional commercially available carotid stents. In the third quarter of 2015 the results of the CGuard CARENET trial were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. In November 2015, positive twelve month follow-up data from the CGuard CARENET trial was presented at the 42nd Annual Symposium on Vascular and Endovascular Issues, documenting the benefits of the CGuard MicroNet technology as well as the patency benefits (maintaining the artery open) of the internal and external carotid arteries at twelve months.

In the first quarter of 2015, we introduced CGuard RX, the new rapid exchange delivery system for CGuard EPS. The rapid exchange delivery system has a guidewire that passes through the delivery system, running through the guiding catheter. It has one port, and thus, can be operated by one operator, while an over-the-wire-delivery system has two lumens and ports and requires two operators to perform the procedure. Our rapid exchange delivery system received CE mark approval in January 2015. We launched our CGuard EPS in Europe with the rapid exchange delivery system in multiple medical specialties that perform carotid artery stenting. These customers include interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, interventional neuroradiologists and interventional radiologists.
 
In September 2015, we announced full market launch of CGuard EPS in Europe. Subsequently, we launched CGuard EPS in Argentina and Colombia, and have received regulatory approval to commercialize CGuard EPS in Russia in November 2016. We plan to launch CGuard EPS in Russia in the first half of 2017.
 
We intend to conduct a clinical trial in the United States and prepared a draft clinical protocol synopsis that could support a pivotal clinical trial for a premarket approval application submission for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A pre-Investigational Device Exemption meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to take place during the first quarter of 2017, by which we plan to seek the consent from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to the roadmap proposed.
 
If we receive sufficient proceeds from future financings, we plan to develop CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge), which we intend to submit for CE mark approval within three calendar quarters of receiving such proceeds. We cannot give any assurance that we will receive sufficient (or any) proceeds from any such financings or the timing of such financings, if ever. In addition, such additional financings may be costly or difficult to complete. Based on the level of interest in this product that we have observed in our clinical trials, we believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter will enable us to meet the market demand for minimally invasive devices, which, we believe, may have broader and easier usage, and for a lower profile system used in procedures in which predilation could be problematic. We also believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter will enable us to have a competitive advantage in penetrating the Asia Pacific market, since its population is generally smaller than in Western countries. In addition, we believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter will enable us to offer CGuard EPS for use in transradial catheterization, which, we believe, is gaining favor among interventionalists.
 
MGuard Products– Coronary Applications
 
Bare-Metal Stent MGuard Product. Our MGuard Prime EPS coronary product is comprised of MicroNet wrapped around a cobalt-chromium based bare-metal stent. In comparison to a conventional bare-metal stent, we believe our MGuard Prime EPS coronary product with MicroNet mesh provides protection from dangerous embolic showers in patients experiencing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, the most severe form of a heart attack, referred to as STEMI. Standard stents were not engineered for heart attack patients. Rather, they were designed for treating stable angina patients whose occlusion is different from that of an occlusion in a heart attack patient. In acute heart attack patients, the plaque or thrombus is unstable and often breaks up as the stent is implanted causing downstream blockages in a significant portion of heart attack patients. Our MGuard Prime EPS is integrated with a precisely engineered micro net mesh that is designed to prevent the unstable arterial plaque and thrombus that caused the heart attack blockage from breaking off.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2014, due to a shift in industry preferences away from bare-metal stents in favor of drug-eluting (drug-coated) stents, we decided to curtail developing and promoting our bare-metal stent platform and instead focus on the development of a drug-eluting stent product. Although we have curtailed development and promotion of MGuard Prime EPS, our distributors and sales staff generally cover all of our current products in the market, including MGuard Prime EPS.
 
Drug-Eluting Stent MicroNet Product Candidate. During 2015, we completed the second phase of development work for our MGuard DES, pursuant to which we incorporated our MicroNet with a drug-eluting stent manufactured by a prospective partner. We believe that a drug-eluting stent with MicroNet has the potential to improve certain performance metrics over the MGuard Prime EPS and attract a broader portion of the cardiologists in the worldwide stent market who are more accustomed to using drug-eluting stents. However, due to our limited resources we have tabled further development of MGuard DES at this time.

NGuard — Neurovascular Applications
 
We are developing a neurovascular flow diverter, which we refer to as NGuard, which is an endovascular device that diverts blood flow away from cerebral aneurysms and ultimately seals the aneurysms. Flow diversion is a growing market segment within the neurovascular medical device field. Current commercial flow diverters are highly flexible dense metal mesh tubes that go across most types of cerebral aneurysms and divert the blood flow away from the aneurysm with the desired end result of sealing the aneurysm. The challenges with the current flow diverters are that they (i) are difficult to place given the high metal content in the device, which makes it more difficult to move the device through the delivery system due to resistance from the metal, and to subsequently accurately place it, (ii) need to be accurately placed to avoid crossing and blocking other cerebral vessels, which could cause additional damage by cutting off blood flow to sections of the brain, (iii) require chronic use of anti-thrombotic medications due to the amount of metal in the cerebral vasculature, which could cause thrombotic complications, and (iv) do not allow a physician to re-access the aneurysm if the aneurysm does not seal, in which event the aneurysm may need to be treated with another therapy such as aneurysm coils, due to the tight metal mesh that will not allow other devices to pass through the flow diverter.
 
Our flow diverter prototype will include our MicroNet that has been employed in CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS. MicroNet has already demonstrated the ability to effectively seal aneurysms in both human coronary arteries using the MGuard Prime EPS and aneurysms in the carotid arteries using CGuard EPS in human clinical situations without the need for additional devices or procedures (coils or a second stent) (source: Journal of Medical Case Reports http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/4/1/238). For our flow diverter, we plan to utilize an open cell, highly flexible metal scaffold to which MicroNet would be attached. We believe our flow diverter could be more accurately delivered due to a lower metal content scaffold than current commercial flow diverters; lower metal content in our flow diverter may reduce the need for long-term anticoagulation; the open cell metal scaffold combined with the MicroNet may allow passage of other devices through the MicroNet mesh without compromising the MicroNet, thus allowing a physician to reaccess the aneurysm, if needed; and our flow diverter should be capable of being delivered through a state-of-the-art microcatheter for accurate placement without constant repositioning. We have tested early flow diverter prototypes in initial pre-clinical testing in both simulated aneurysm bench models using various MicroNet configurations with varying aperture sizes, as well as in standard in vivo pre-clinical models, in which we observed aneurysm sealing and also wide open side branch vessels across which the device was placed. However, as we plan to focus our resources on the further expansion of our sales and marketing activities for CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS and, provided that we have sufficient resources, the development of CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge) and its submission for CE mark approval, we do not intend to resume further development of NGuard until at least the third quarter of 2018.


PVGuard — Peripheral Vascular Applications
 
We intend to develop our MicroNet mesh sleeve and a self-expandable stent for use in peripheral vascular applications, to which we refer to as PVGuard. PVDs are usually characterized by the accumulation of plaque in arteries in the legs. This accumulation can lead to the need for amputation or even death, when untreated. PVD is treated either by trying to clear the artery of the blockage, or by implanting a stent in the affected area to push the blockage out of the way of normal blood flow.
 
As in carotid procedures, peripheral procedures are characterized by the necessity of controlling embolic showers both during and post-procedure. Controlling embolic showers is so important in these indications that physicians often use fully covered stents, at the risk of blocking branching vessels, to ensure that emboli do not fall into the bloodstream and move to the brain. We believe that our MicroNet design will provide substantial advantages over existing therapies in treating peripheral artery stenosis.
 
However, as we plan to focus our resources on the further expansion of our sales and marketing activities for CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS and, provided that we have sufficient resources, the development of CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge) and its submission for CE mark approval, we do not intend to pursue the development of PVGuard in the near future.

Completed Clinical Trials for CGuard EPS 
 
CARENET 
 
The CARENET trial was the first multi-center study of CGuard EPS following the receipt of CE mark of this device in March 2013. The CARENET trial was designed to evaluate feasibility and safety of CGuard EPS in treatment of carotid lesions in consecutive patients suitable for coronary artery stenting (“CAS”) in a multi-operator, real-life setting. The acute, 30 day, magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), ultrasound and six month clinical event results were presented at the LINC conference in Leipzig, Germany in February, 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, the results of the CGuard CARENET trial were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. In November 2015, positive twelve month follow-up data from the CGuard CARENET trial was presented at the 42nd Annual Symposium on Vascular and Endovascular Issues, documenting the benefits of the CGuard MicroNet technology as well as the patency benefits (maintaining the artery open) of the internal and external carotid arteries at twelve months.
 
MACCE (myocardial infarction (“MI”), stroke or death) was 0.0% at 30 days. At six months, there was one case of death, which was not stent or procedure-related, and MACCE was increased to 3.6%. At twelve months there were three cases of death, which were not stent or procedure-related, and MACCE was 11.1%.
 

 | 30 days (n=30) | | 6 months (n=28) | | 12 months (n=27) | 
------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+---+----------------------------------------------------------+---+-----------------------------------------------------------+--

(2) Values extrapolated from event curves (source: The CARENET all-comer trial using the CGuard micronet-covered carotid embolic prevention stent, presented by Dr. Piotr Musialek at the LINC 2015 conference)
 
CAS carries the risk of cerebral embolization during and following the procedure, leading to life-threatening complications, mainly cerebral ischemic events. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a sensitive tool used to identify cerebral emboli during CAS by measuring “lesions” within the brain which are areas that are ischemic and do not receive oxygenated blood due to cerebral emboli. In the CARENET trial, 37.0% of patients treated with CGuard EPS had new ischemic lesions at 48 hours after the procedure, with an average volume of 0.039 cm3. Of these lesions, there was only one that remained at 30 days following the procedure and all others had resolved. Complete details appear in the following table. Where there is a second number shown below after a ±, it indicates the rate of error.

The healing process of the tissue and in-stent restenosis can be measured by a non-invasive form of ultrasound called duplex ultrasound. This type of ultrasound measures the velocity of the blood that flows within the carotid arteries, which increases exponentially as the lumen of the internal carotid artery narrows and the percent stenosis increases. One of the measurements is called PSV (peak systolic volume) and is known to be highly correlated to the degree of in-stent restenosis; PSV values higher than 300 cm/sec are indicative of >70% stenosis, while PSV values lower than 104 cm/sec are indicative of <30% restenosis and healthy healing. In the CARENET trial, duplex ultrasound measurements done at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months following the stenting procedure all attest to healthy normal healing without restenosis concerns, as the PSV values were 60.96 cm/sec ± 22.31, 85.24 cm/sec ± 39.56, and 90.22 cm/sec ± 37.72 respectively. The internal carotid artery was patent in all patients (100%).
 
The conclusions of the CARENET trial were:
 

● | CARENET trial demonstrated safety of the CGuard EPS stent, with 30 day MACCE of 0%. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Incidence of new ipsilateral lesions (percent of patients with new lesions on the ipsilateral side (same side where the stent was employed)) at 48 hours was reduced by almost half compared to published data, and volume was reduced almost tenfold. 
● | All but one lesion had resolved completely by 30 days. 
● | Twelve month data showed no change in peak systolic velocity between 6 months and 12 months, suggesting no restenosis concerns. 
● | CGuard EPS offers unique clinical benefits for patients undergoing CAS with unprecedented safety. 

 
Physician-Sponsored Clinical Trials for CGuard—PARADIGM-101 Study
 
PARADIGM-101 (Prospective evaluation of All-comer peRcutaneous cArotiD revascularization In symptomatic and increased-risk asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, using CGuard™ Mesh-covered embolic prevention stent system-101) was an investigator-led, single center study with the objective of evaluating feasibility and outcome of routine anti-embolic stent system in 101 consecutive unselected all-comer patients referred for carotid revascularization, initiated in 2015. In May 2016, the 30-day positive results were presented at the EuroPCR 2016 Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session in Paris, and in the Journal of EuroIntervention. In November 2016, positive twelve month follow-up data was presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) 2016 conference, documenting the benefits of the CGuard MicroNet technology at twelve months.
 
Key findings from the PARADIGM-101 study and the follow-up data are as follows:
 

● | CGuard EPS delivery success was 99.1%. The clinical evaluation also found no device foreshortening or elongation; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Angiographic diameter stenosis or vessel narrowing was reduced from 83±9% to only 6.7±5% (p<0.001); 
● | Periprocedural complications were 0%; 
● | One event was adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee as a minor stroke (0.9%), with no change in NIH Stroke Scale or modified Ranking scale; and 
● | At 12 months, no new adverse events (0%) were noted by independent neurologist evaluation.

The results of the PARADIGM-101 study demonstrated that CGuard EPS can safely be used on a high risk, all-comer population of patients with carotid artery stenosis and indicate that routine use of CGuard EPS may prevent cerebral events, such as strokes, by holding plaque against the vessel wall, preventing emboli from being released into the blood stream. The PARADIGM-101 study found that CGuard EPS is applicable in up to 90% of all-comer patients with carotid stenosis.
 
Clinical Results and Mechanical Properties of the Carotid CGUARD Double-Layered Embolic Prevention Stent Study
 
Clinical Results and Mechanical Properties of the Carotid CGUARD Double-Layered Embolic Prevention Stent Study was an investigator-led, prospective single-center study which evaluated CGuard EPS in 30 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery stenosis disease with the objective of reporting early clinical outcomes with a novel double-layer stent for the internal carotid artery and the in vitro investigation of the stent’s mechanical properties. In October 2016, the 30-day positive results were published online-ahead-of-print in the Journal of Enovascular Therapy.
 
Key findings from the study are as follows:
 

● | 100% success in implanting CGuard EPS without residual stenosis; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | No peri- or post-procedural complications; 
● | No deaths, major adverse events, minor or major strokes, or new neurologic symptoms during the six months following the procedure; 
● | Modified Rankin Scale improved for the symptomatic patients from 1.56 prior to the procedure to 0 afterwards; 
● | All vessels treated with CGuard EPS remained patent (open) at six months; and 
● | DW-MRI performed in 19 of 30 patients found no new ipsilateral lesions after 30 days and after six months compared with the baseline DW-MRI studies. 

 
Additionally, based on engineering evaluations, the study concluded that CGuard EPS provides a high radial force and strong support in stenotic lesions. The stent is easy to use and safe to implant because it does not foreshorten and its structure adapts well to changes in diameter and direction of tortuous vascular anatomies. The MicroNet mesh of CGuard did not cause any changes to specific mechanical parameters of the underlying stent.
 
CGUARD Mesh-Covered Stent in Real World: The IRON-Guard Registry
 
CGUARD Mesh-Covered Stent in Real World: The IRON-Guard Registry using CGuard EPS is a physician initiated prospective multi-center registry which included 200 patients from 12 medical centers in Italy. The objective of the study was to report 30-day outcomes (including MACCE) in a prospective series of patients submitted to protected carotid artery stenting with CGuard EPS between April 2015 and June 2016. In January 2017, 30-day results were presented at the Leipzig Interventional Course (LINC) 2017.
 
Key 30-day results presented are as follows:
 

● | 100% success in implanting CGuard EPS; 
--+---------------------------------------------
● | No MI, major stroke or death at 30 days;

Completed Clinical Trials for MGuard Bare-Metal Coronary Products
 
We have completed eight clinical trials with respect to our first generation stainless steel-based MGuard stent and our cobalt-chromium based MGuard Prime EPS stent. Our first generation MGuard stent combining the MicroNet with a stainless steel stent received CE mark approval for the treatment of coronary artery disease in the European Union in October 2007. We subsequently replaced the stainless steel stent with a more advanced cobalt-chromium based stent for MGuard Prime EPS.
 
The First in Men (FIM) study conducted in Germany from the fourth quarter of 2006 through the second quarter of 2008 focused on patients with occlusion in their stent graft. This group is considered to be in “high risk” for complications during and shortly after the procedure due to the substantial risk of occurrence of a thromboembolic event. The study demonstrated MGuard stent’s safety in this high risk group. This study was followed by the GUARD study in Brazil in 2007 with a similar patient population which reinforced the safety profile of MGuard stents in patients prone to procedural complications. The MAGICAL study was a pilot study in STEMI patients conducted in Poland from 2008 through 2012 which demonstrated safety, measured by MACE rates at 30 days following the stent procedure, as well as efficacy results, measured by the ability of MGuard to reestablish blood flow into the infarcted area of the muscle. Furthermore, we conducted three registries (iMOS, IMR and iMOS Prime) that confirmed the feasibility of MGuard and MGuard Prime EPS for the treatment of STEMI patients and the safety of MGuard and MGuard Prime EPS in the STEMI patient group. Safety was repeatedly demonstrated in these trials and registries by the low mortality rate in the first month after the procedure.
 
In the second calendar quarter of 2011, we began the MGuard for Acute ST Elevation Reperfusion Trial (which we refer to as our “MASTER I trial”), a prospective, randomized study, which demonstrated that among patients with acute STEMI undergoing emergency PCI, patients treated with MGuard had superior rates of epicardial coronary flow (blood flow within the vessels that run along the outer surface of the heart) and complete ST-segment resolution, or restoration of blood flow to the heart muscle after a heart attack, compared to those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. The results of this trial are summarized in greater detail below.
 
Finally, the MASTER II trial, which we initially initiated as part of our efforts to seek approval of our MGuard Prime EPS by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was discontinued at our election in its current form in light of market conditions moving toward the use of drug-eluting stents over bare-metal stents. Analysis of the patients already enrolled in the MASTER II trial prior to its suspension, however, reconfirmed the MASTER I safety results due to a continued low mortality rate.

MASTER I Trial
 
In the second calendar quarter of 2011, we began the MASTER I trial, a prospective, randomized study in Europe, South America and Israel to compare the MGuard with commercially-approved bare metal and drug-eluting stents in achieving superior myocardial reperfusion (the restoration of blood flow) in primary angioplasty for the treatment of acute STEMI, the most severe form of heart attack. The MASTER I trial enrolled 433 subjects, 50% of whom were treated with MGuard and 50% of whom were treated with a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent. The detailed acute and 30 days results from the trial were presented at the TCT conference on October 24, 2012 and published (Prospective, Randomized, Multicenter Evaluation of a Polyethylene Terephthalate Micronet Mesh–Covered Stent (MGuard) in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction, Stone et. Al, JACC, 60; 2012). The results were as follows:

● | The primary endpoint of post-procedure complete ST-segment resolution (restoration of blood flow to the heart muscle after a heart attack) was statistically significantly improved in patients randomized to the MGuard compared to patients receiving a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent (57.8% vs. 44.7%). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Patients receiving MGuard exhibited superior rates of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 flow, which evidences normal coronary blood flow that fills the distal coronary bed completely, as compared to patients receiving a commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stent (91.7% vs. 82.9%), with comparable rates of myocardial blush grade 2 or 3 (83.9% vs. 84.7%) and corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) (17.0 vs. 18.1), all markers of optimal blood flow to the heart. 
● | Angiographic success rates (attainment of <50% final residual stenosis of the target lesion and final TIMI 3 flow) were higher in the MGuard group compared to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents (91.7% vs 82.4%). 
● | Mortality (0% vs. 1.9%) and major adverse cardiac events (1.8% vs. 2.3%) at 30 days post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to MGuard as opposed to patients randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac event components, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between the MGuard and commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. 

 
The six month results from the MASTER I trial, which were presented at the 2013 EuroPCR Meeting, the official annual meeting of the European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, on May 23, 2013 in Paris, France. The results were as follows:
 

● | Mortality (0.5% vs. 2.8%) and major adverse cardiac events (5.2% vs. 3.4%) at 6 months post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to the MGuard as compared to patients randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac event components, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between patients treated with MGuard and those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The twelve month results from the MASTER I trial were presented at the TCT conference on October 29, 2013 and published (Mesh-Covered Embolic Protection Stent Implantation in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Final 1-Year Clinical and Angiographic Results From the MGUARD for Acute ST Elevation Reperfusion Trial, Dudek e. el, Coronary Interventions, 2014. The results were as follows:
 

● | Mortality (1.0% vs. 3.3%) and major adverse cardiac events (9.1% vs. 3.3%) at 12 months post procedure were not statistically significantly different between patients randomized to the MGuard as opposed to those randomized to commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. All other major adverse cardiac events, as well as stent thrombosis, were comparable between the MGuard and commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In summary, the MASTER I trial demonstrated that among patients with acute STEMI undergoing emergency PCI patients treated with MGuard had superior rates of epicardial coronary flow (blood flow within the vessels that run along the outer surface of the heart) and complete ST-segment resolution compared to those treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents. In addition, patients treated with MGuard showed a slightly lower mortality rate and a slightly higher major adverse cardiac event rate as compared to patients treated with commercially-approved bare metal or drug-eluting stents six and twelve months post procedure.

Future Clinical Trials for CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS 
 
Post-marketing clinical trials (outside the United States) could be conducted to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CGuard EPS in specific indications. These trials would be designed to facilitate market acceptance and expand the use of the product. We should be able to rely upon CE mark approval of the product and other supporting clinical data to obtain local approvals.
 
We are currently preparing materials required to conduct a clinical trial of CGuard EPS in the United States and have a draft clinical protocol synopsis that we believe could support a clinical trial for submission for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Once complete, we plan to request a pre-submission guidance meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
 
We do not anticipate conducting additional post-marketing clinical trials for our bare-metal MGuard coronary products.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Our primary business objective is to utilize our proprietary technology to become the industry standard for treatment of complex vascular and coronary disease and to provide a superior solution to the common acute problems caused by current stenting procedures, such as restenosis, embolic showers and late thrombosis. We are pursuing the following business strategies in order to achieve this objective.

● | Grow our presence in existing and new markets for CGuard EPS. We have fully launched CGuard EPS in most European and Latin American countries, through a combination of distributor sales organizations. We are also pursuing additional registrations and contracts with local distributors in other countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. We believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter will enable us to meet the market demand for minimally invasive devices, have a competitive advantage in penetrating the Asia Pacific market and offer our product for transradial catheterization, which, we believe, is gaining favor among interventionalists. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continue to leverage MicroNet technology to develop additional applications for interventional cardiologists and vascular surgeons. In addition to the applications described above, we believe that we will eventually be able to utilize our proprietary MicroNet technology to address imminent market needs for new product innovations to significantly improve patients’ care. We continue to broadly develop and protect intellectual property using our mesh technology. Examples of some areas include peripheral vascular disease, neurovascular disease, renal artery disease, and bifurcation disease. 
● | Establish relationships with collaborative and development partners to fully develop and market our existing and future products. We are seeking strategic partners for collaborative research, development, marketing, distribution, or other agreements, which could assist with our development and commercialization efforts for CGuard EPS and NGuard, as well as future efforts with MGuard Prime EPS, MGuard DES, and other potential products that are based on our MicroNet technology.

--


● | Continue to protect and expand our portfolio of patents. Our MicroNet technology and the use of patents to protect it are critical to our success. We own numerous patents for our MicroNet technology. Twelve separate patent applications have been filed in the United States, some of which have corresponding patent applications and/or issued patents in Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, and South Africa. We believe these patents and patent applications collectively cover all of our existing products, and may be useful for protecting our future technological developments. We intend to aggressively continue patenting new technology, and to actively pursue any infringement covered by any of our patents. We believe that our patents, and patent applications once allowed, are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and maximizing our return on research and development investments. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Resume development and successfully commercialize MGuard DES. While we have limited the focus of product development to carotid and neurovascular products, if we resume development of our coronary products, we plan to evaluate opportunities to further develop MGuard DES. 

Competition 
 
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, subject to change and impacted by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants.
 
Carotid
 
The carotid stent markets in the United States and Europe are dominated by Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation, Covidien Ltd. (currently part of Medtronic, Inc.), and Cordis Corporation (currently part of Cardinal Health, Inc.). Gore Medical and Terumo Medical Corporation produce a polytetrafluoroethylene mesh-covered stent and a double layer metal stent, respectively. All of these larger companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, broader product lines, larger sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs and larger facilities than ours and have established reputations and relationships with our target customers, as well as worldwide distribution channels that are more effective than ours. However, we believe that the European market is somewhat fragmented, and, in our opinion, smaller competitors may be able to gain market share with greater flexibility.
Coronary
 
The bare-metal stent and the drug-eluting stent markets in the United States and Europe are dominated by Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation, and Medtronic, Inc. In the future, we believe that physicians will look to next-generation stent technology to compete with existing therapies. These new technologies will likely include bio-absorbable stents, stents that focus on treating bifurcated lesions, and stents with superior polymer and drug coatings, and many industry participants are working to improve stenting procedures in the future as the portfolio of available stent technologies rapidly increases.
 
According to the MEDTECH OUTLOOK, the three major players (Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific Corporation and Medtronic, Inc.) in the worldwide coronary stent market have a combined total market share of approximately 92%. To date, our sales are not significant enough to register in market share. As such, one of the challenges we face to further our product growth is the competition from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the therapeutics area, as well as competition from academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. Most of our current and potential competitors, including but not limited to those listed above, have, and will continue to have, substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, regulatory and clinical, manufacturing, marketing and sales, distribution and personnel resources than we do. Due to ongoing consolidation in the industry, there are high barriers to entry for small manufacturers in both the European and the United States markets.


Neurovascular
 
Stryker Corporation dominated the global interventional neurology market in 2014. The other key players in this market include Medtronic plc, Johnson & Johnson, Terumo Corporation, Penumbra, Abbott Laboratories, Merit Medical Systems, Inc., W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Microport Scientific Corporation, and Medikit Co., Ltd., among others. (Source: Markets and Markets 2015).

Research and Development Expenses
 
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we spent $1.3 million and $3.6 million, respectively, on research and development.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
Currently, we are actively selling our MGuard coronary products with a bio-stable MicroNet through local distributors in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia.
 
Based on the positive CGuard EPS clinical data, we commercially launched CGuard EPS in CE marked countries in early 2015. We initially sold CGuard products through a distributor network as we did with MGuard coronary products. In September 2015, we announced full market launch of CGuard EPS in Europe.
 
We plan to focus our marketing efforts primarily on Europe, Asia and Latin America and sales through local and regional distribution partners and our own internal sales initiatives. In addition, we are using international trade shows and industry conferences to gain market exposure and brand recognition. We plan to work with leading physicians to enhance our marketing efforts.
 
Product Positioning 
 
The MGuard coronary products have initially penetrated the market by entering segments with indications that present high risks of embolic dislodgement, notably acute MI and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions. Even though MGuard technology has demonstrated its advantages with clinical data, it is based on a bare-metal platform while the market demand has shifted away from bare-metal stents in favor of drug-eluting stents.
 
When treating carotid artery disease, we believe that there is an opportunity to enter the market with bare-metal stent platform and to become a competitive player without a drug-eluting stent platform. Therefore, we believe that CGuard EPS is poised for commercial growth in 2017 as more and more positive clinical data is presented. If we receive sufficient proceeds from future financings, we plan to develop CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter (5 French gauge), which we intend to submit for CE mark approval within three calendar quarters of receiving such proceeds. Based on the level of interest in this product that we have observed in our clinical trials, we believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter will enable us to meet the market demand for minimally invasive devices, which, we believe, may have broader and easier usage, and for a lower profile system used in procedures in which predilation could be problematic. We also believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter will enable us to have a competitive advantage in penetrating the Asia Pacific market, since its population is generally smaller than in Western countries. In addition, we believe that CGuard EPS with a smaller delivery catheter will enable us to offer CGuard EPS for use in transradial catheterization, which, we believe, is gaining favor among interventionalists. Finally, we do not expect that it would be crucial to use a drug-eluting stent platform to compete in certain new markets such as the neurovascular market, and hence, we plan to continue to explore this area of opportunity.
 
Insurance Reimbursement 
 
In most countries, a significant portion of a patient’s medical expenses is covered by third-party payers. Third-party payers can include both government funded insurance programs and private insurance programs. While each payer develops and maintains its own coverage and reimbursement policies, the vast majority of payers have similarly established policies. All of the MGuard coronary products and CGuard products sold to date have been designed and labeled in such a way as to facilitate the utilization of existing reimbursement codes, and we intend to continue to design and label our present and future products in a manner consistent with this goal.
 
While most countries have established reimbursement codes for stenting procedures, certain countries may require additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and reimbursement for the MGuard coronary products and CGuard products or in order to obtain a higher reimbursement price. In these situations, we intend to complete the required clinical studies to obtain reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.

Intellectual Property 
 
Patents
 
We have twenty-eight pending patent applications, twelve of which are pending in the United States, many of which cover aspects of our MGuard and CGuard technology. Some of the corresponding patent applications outside the U.S. are filed in Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India and South Africa. We hold an aggregate total of 50 patents and pending applications including six issued U.S. patents. These patent rights are directed to cover the following eight (8) patent families:

In lay terms, these patent applications generally cover three aspects of our products: the mesh sleeve with and without a drug, the product and the delivery mechanism of the stent. We also believe that one or more additional pending patent applications, upon issuance, will cover our existing products. We also believe that the patent applications we have filed, in particular those covering the use of a knitted micron-level mesh sleeve over a stent for various indications, if issued as patents with claims substantially in their present form, would likely create a significant barrier for another company seeking to use similar technology.

Trademarks 
 
We use the InspireMD®, MGuard®, CGuard®, and MGuard Prime® trademarks in connection with our products. We have registered these trademarks in the European Union. The trademarks are renewable indefinitely, so long as we make the appropriate filings when required. We also have registrations for Carenet®, NGuard® and the MNP Micronet Protection Logo in the European Union and a supplemental registration for Micronet® in the United States. We have also applied to register the names PVGuard™ as a trademark in the European Union, as well as Carenet™, CGuard™ InspireMD™, SmartFit™, PVGuardTM, NGuardTM, AGuardTM, and MGuard Prime™ as trademarks in the United States. We also use and may have common law rights to various trademarks, trade names, and service marks.
Government Regulation
 
The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the European Union CE mark and other corresponding foreign agencies.
 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance, clinical trials and production controls in others. As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing approval may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration market authorization. These differences may affect the efficiency and timeliness of international market introduction of our products. For the European Union nations, medical devices must obtain a CE mark before they may be placed on the market. In order to obtain and maintain the CE mark, we must comply with the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC by presenting comprehensive technical files for our products demonstrating safety and efficacy of the product to be placed on the market and passing initial and annual quality management system audit as per ISO 13485 standard by an European Notified Body. We have obtained ISO 13485 quality system certification and the products we currently distribute into the European Union display the required CE mark. In order to maintain certification, we are required to pass annual facilities audit inspections conducted by European Notified Body inspectors.
 
As noted below, we have regulatory approval and have made sales of MGuard Prime EPS, CGuard EPS or both products either through distributors pursuant to distribution agreements or directly, in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We have temporary regulatory approval to sell MGuard Prime EPS in Malaysia while we are in the registration process due to a regulatory change in November 2015. In addition, we have distribution agreements for our products in Uzbekistan, Canada, Venezuela, and Armenia, although we have not yet obtained regulatory approval to sell our products in those countries, and we are awaiting regulatory approval to sell our products in India and Brazil (for CGuard EPS). While each of the European Union member countries accepts the CE mark as its sole requirement for marketing approval, some of these countries still require us to take additional steps in order to gain reimbursement rights for our products. Furthermore, while we believe that certain of the above-listed countries that are not members of the European Union accept the CE mark as a primary requirement for marketing approval, each such country requires additional regulatory requirements for final marketing approval of our products. Furthermore, we are currently targeting additional countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, however, even if all governmental regulatory requirements are satisfied in each such country, we anticipate that obtaining marketing approval in each country could take as few as three months or as many as twelve months or more, due to the nature of the approval process in each individual country, including typical wait times for application processing and review, as discussed in greater detail below.
 
In October 2007, our first generation MGuard stent combining the MicroNet with a stainless steel stent received CE mark approval for the treatment of coronary artery disease in the European Union. We subsequently replaced the first generation MGuard product with MGuard Prime EPS, which uses a more advanced cobalt-chromium based stent. Our MGuard Prime EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in October 2010 and marketing approval in those countries listed in the table below. We are focused on seeking marketing approval in these countries because we believe that these countries represent the strongest opportunities for us to grow with respect to our sales.

(1) | We have made sales to distributors in this country, but based upon information from such distributors, we believe that the product has not been sold to customers in this country. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Due to the changes made to the relevant regulations in Malaysia that became effective in November 2015, we are required to register our product. On November 29, 2015, we initiated the registration process required pursuant to the amended regulation. We have temporary authorization to sell and market MGuard Prime EPS in Malaysia pending a final determination of our application for registration based on a regulatory exemption covering applications for registration submitted between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016. 
(3) | We believe that we have regulatory approval for MGuard Prime EPS in South Africa based upon information from our former distributor in such country, who was responsible for obtaining the regulatory approval for MGuard Prime EPS. However, the certificate evidencing regulatory approval was held by our former distributor and we cannot guarantee that it is in full force and effect. Our distribution agreement with the distributor in South Africa expired pursuant to the terms of such distribution agreement on February 1, 2015. 

 
In the United States, the medical devices that we will manufacture and sell in the future are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated and administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, each medical device must receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance or approval or exemption from such clearance or approval before we can market such device commercially in the U.S.
 
We anticipate that our CGuard EPS will be classified as a Class III medical device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Class III medical devices are generally the highest risk devices and are therefore subject to the highest level of regulatory control by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration process of premarket approval involves scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices for the purpose(s) intended. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will either approve or deny a premarket approval application and we cannot market a device unless or until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves a premarket approval application.
 
We expect the approval process in the U.S. to take a significant amount of time, require the expenditure of significant resources, involve rigorous clinical investigations and testing, and potentially require changes to products. The approval process may result in limitations on the indicated uses of the medical devices for which we are able to obtain approval (since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can take action against a company that promotes off-label uses) and will also require increased post-market surveillance.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulations covering medical devices also regulate labeling, reporting of certain events (such as adverse events, corrections and removals), manufacturing practices (including extensive the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s extensive Quality System Regulation), device tracking and identification.

We will also be required to register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a medical device manufacturer. As such, our manufacturing facilities will be subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspections for compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Quality System Regulation. Additionally, some of our subcontractors may also be subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspections for compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Quality System Regulation. These regulations will require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and quality control activities. As a medical device manufacturer, we will further be required to comply with U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events associated with the use of our medical devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations also govern product labeling and prohibit a manufacturer from marketing a medical device for unapproved applications.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration actively monitors compliance with laws and regulations through its review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices (that is, medical devices that do not comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including as implemented through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s regulations); order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other amending laws pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products, may limit our ability to obtain premarket approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.
 
Customers
 
Our customer base is varied. We began shipping our product to customers in Europe in January 2008 and have since expanded our global distribution network to Southeast Asia, India, Latin America and Israel. We currently have distribution agreements for our CE mark-approved MGuard Prime EPS and/or CGuard EPS with medical product distributors based in Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Australia and Latin America. We are currently in discussions with additional distribution companies in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 85% of our revenue was generated in Europe, and 9% of our revenue was generated in Latin America, with the remaining 6% of our revenue generated in the rest of the world. Our major customers in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, were Penumbra, Inc., a distributor in Europe that accounted for 28% of our revenues, and Crossmed S.r.l., a distributor in Italy that accounted for 13% of our revenues.
 
Most of our current agreements with our distributors stipulate that, and we expect our future agreements with our distributors to stipulate that, while we shall assist in training by providing training materials, marketing guidance, marketing materials, and technical guidance, each distributor will be responsible for carrying out local registration, sales and marketing activities. In addition, in most cases, all sales costs, including sales representatives, incentive programs, and marketing trials, will be borne by the distributor. Under current agreements, distributors purchase stents from us at a fixed price. Our current agreements with distributors are generally for a term of two to three years.
 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
The polymer fiber for MicroNet is supplied by Biogeneral, Inc., a San Diego, California-based specialty polymer manufacturer for medical and engineering applications.

Natec Medical Ltd. supplies us with catheters that help create the base for our MGuard Prime EPS. Our agreement with Natec Medical Ltd., which may be terminated by either party upon six months’ notice, calls for non-binding minimum orders.
 
The cobalt-chromium stent for our MGuard Prime EPS was designed by Svelte Medical Systems Inc. We have an agreement with Svelte Medical Systems Inc., as amended, that grants us a non-exclusive, worldwide license for production and use of the MGuard Prime cobalt-chromium stent for the life of the stent’s patent, subject to the earlier termination of the agreement upon the bankruptcy of either party or the uncured default by either party under any material provision of the agreement. Our royalty payments to Svelte Medical Systems Inc. are determined by the sales volume of MGuard Prime EPS. Currently, the royalty rate is 2.9% of all net sales. We have mutual indemnification obligations with Svelte Medical Systems Inc. for any damages suffered as a result of third party actions based upon breaches of representations and warranties or the failure to perform certain covenants in the license agreement, and Svelte Medical Systems Inc. will also indemnify us for any damages suffered as a result of third party actions based upon intellectual property or design claims against the cobalt-chromium stent for the MGuard Prime EPS.
 
We manufacture our CGuard EPS and MGuard Prime EPS at our own facility. The bare-metal cobalt-chromium stents for our MGuard Prime EPS and the self-expanding bare-metal stents for our CGuard EPS are being manufactured and supplied by MeKo Laserstrahl-Materialbearbeitung. Our agreement with MeKo Laserstrahl-Materialbearbeitung for the production of electro polished L605 bare-metal stents for MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS is priced on a per-stent basis, subject to the quantity of stents ordered. The complete assembly process for MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS, including knitting and securing the sleeve to the stent and the crimping of the sleeve stent on to a delivery catheter, is done at our Israel manufacturing site. Once MGuard Prime EPS and CGuard EPS have been assembled, they are sent for sterilization in Germany, and then back to Israel for final packaging and distribution.
 
Each MGuard stent is manufactured from two main components, the stent and the mesh polymer. The stent is made out of cobalt chromium. This material is readily available and we acquire it in the open market. The mesh is made from polyethylene terephthalate (polyester). This material is readily available in the market as well, because it is used for many medical applications. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material in fiber form, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. In addition, in order to retain the approval of the CE mark, we are required to perform periodic audits of the quality control systems of our key suppliers in order to insure that their products meet our predetermined specifications.
 
A CGuard EPS consists of a CGuard stent and the delivery system. Each CGuard stent is manufactured from two main components, a self-expending nickel-titanium stent and the mesh polymer. This material is readily available and we acquire it in the open market. The mesh is made from polyethylene terephthalate (polyester). We have pending patent rights that cover the proposed CGuard stent with mesh. This material is readily available in the market as well, because it is used for many medical applications. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material in fiber form, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. The delivery system for CGuard is made out of polymer tubes we acquire from an original equipment manufacturer. In the event that our supplier can no longer supply this material, we would need to qualify another supplier, which could take several months. In addition, in order to retain the approval of the CE mark, we are required to perform periodic audits of the quality control systems of our key suppliers in order to insure that their products meet our predetermined specifications.


Employees 
 
As of February 15, 2017, we had 34 full-time employees. Except for one of our employees in Europe, our employees are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We do not expect the collective bargaining agreements to which our employees are party to have a material effect on our business or results of operations. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.
