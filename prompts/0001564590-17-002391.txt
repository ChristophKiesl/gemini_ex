Overview 
 CSG Systems International, Inc. (the “Company”, “CSG”, or forms of the pronoun “we”) is one of the world’s largest and most established providers of business support solutions, primarily serving the global communications industry. We have over thirty years of expertise supporting communications service providers (“CSPs”) as their businesses have evolved from a single product offering to highly complex and competitive multi-product offerings, while also requiring increasingly differentiated, real-time, and personalized experiences for their customers. 
 Our proven experience and world-class solutions support the mission critical management of our clients’ revenue, customer interactions, and digital ecosystem as they advance their video, voice, data, content, and digital services to consumers. Over the years, we have focused our research and development (“R&D”) and acquisition investments on expanding our solution set to address the complex, transformative needs of service providers. Our broad and deep solutions help our clients be competitive in a dynamically evolving global business environment, respond to changing consumer demands, quickly launch new compelling product offerings, provide enhanced customer experiences through relevant and targeted interactions, and cost-effectively streamline and scale operations. 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 9555 Maroon Circle, Englewood, Colorado 80112, and the telephone number at that address is (303) 200-2000. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “CSGS”. We are a S&P Small Cap 600 company. 
 Industry Overview 
 Background. We provide business support solutions (“BSS”) to the world’s leading CSPs, as well as clients in several evolving, highly competitive industries. Our solutions coordinate and manage many aspects of a service provider’s customer interactions, from the initial activation of customer accounts, to the support and fulfilment of various services, and through the calculation, presentment, and accounts receivables management of monthly customer statements. While our heritage is in serving the North American video and satellite market, through acquisition and organic growth, we have enhanced our solutions and approach to support the broad scope of participants in the global communications landscape such as carriers, media and entertainment, and digital content distribution. 
 Market Trends of Communications Industry. The global communications industry is going through an unprecedented level of change.  This dramatic disruption is driving the emergence of heightened competition, innovative digital products, compelling customer engagements, real-time operational processes, and intense cost pressures. There are some key trends that are emerging as CSPs try to evolve and compete in this highly complex ecosystem.

• | The first trend in the communications industry is the dramatic shift in purchasing power to the “always-connected” consumer, who ultimately demands any content, on any device at any time. Consumers have more choices now than ever before among various options for communication services, entertainment content, portable devices, and service providers. The competition among providers to obtain, retain, and grow their share of wallet has thus increased dramatically. CSPs must provide compelling offerings and positive customer experiences to differentiate themselves and maintain long-term customer relationships. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The next critical trend faced by CSPs is meeting the consumer demands for a seamless, real-time, and personalized engagement with providers. Consumers have become accustomed to and value a simplified purchasing experience, much like they do with online apps like music or video downloads. And while many aspects of a consumer’s experience outwardly appear simpler, the complexity behind the comprehensive services framework dramatically increases with the integration of emerging services like over-the-top (“OTT”), digital services (home security, health services, etc.), and digital payment functionality. The increased velocity required in managing relevant pricing, packaging, promotions, and personalized experiences within this changing business environment requires increased flexibility and nimbleness in the CSPs’ operational platforms.

• | The third trend that we see is the evolution of the CSPs to a digital lifestyle services provider. In an “always-on” and connected digital society, some CSPs desire to be the key source for content in a highly personalized experience based on individual consumer needs, desires, and consumption history. These providers look beyond their own network and provide ubiquitous access to digital services. The “brand” and the “experience” become much more important to these providers as brand loyalty and personalized experience play a larger role in purchasing decisions. They will no longer be competing solely with the traditional communication companies, but will also be competing against well-known brands like Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google for their share of the consumer’s wallet. And, importantly, they will be looking to create a digital

services ecosystem that extends beyond the traditional video, entertainment, and content services and offer everything from e-books to health care monitoring services, thereby increasing their ecosystem and revenue management complexity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finally, the last trend relates to an increased pressure for CSPs to find new revenue sources, while also managing their cost structure and quality of service delivery during their business transformation. CSPs are seeing a decline in revenues and profits associated with their traditional services like wireline voice and video as a result of new or increased competition. In order to offset these declining revenues and profits, CSPs are looking for ways to improve their cost structure, grow through acquisitions, and launch new, revenue generating services with minimal capital investment. The result is many CSPs are cutting costs associated with their traditional systems, integrating disparate acquired business operations, and launching new digital services with highly-flexible, lower cost solutions.

 Overall, these market trends drive the demand for scalable, flexible, and cost-efficient revenue and customer interaction management solutions, which we believe will provide us with revenue opportunities. As a result, we have historically invested a significant amount of our revenues in R&D and have acquired companies that enable us to expand our offerings in a timely and efficient manner. We believe that our scalable, modular, and flexible solutions combined with our rich domain expertise provide the industry with proven solutions to improve their profitability and consumers’ experiences.  We have specifically architected our solutions to provide operators with an incremental approach to transforming their businesses, thereby reducing the risk associated with this evolution.
 Market Conditions of the Communications Industry. As the majority of our clients operate within the global communications industry sector, the economic state of this industry directly impacts our business.  The global communications industry has undergone significant fluctuations in growth rates and capital investment cycles over the past several years due to multiple competitive and economic factors.  Current economic indices suggest a stabilization of the industry, but it is impossible to predict whether this stabilization will persist or be subject to future instability.  In addition, industry consolidation continues as CSPs look for ways to expand their product offerings, extend their market share, increase their revenues, and gain greater scale efficiencies in their operations.
 The impact of these market factors has resulted in spending cautiousness with large transformational projects being displaced in favor of more incremental changes to business operations. Globally, mature operators are looking for ways to differentiate competitive offerings, foster customer loyalty, effectively control costs, streamline operations, and scale business operations, while operators in emerging markets are focusing on capitalizing on the rapid growth of new digital services and the explosion of connected devices. Regardless of the specific situation, companies continue to have an increased focus on investing in those solutions and services that have a demonstrable short-term return on investment, generate new revenues, and help businesses remain competitive and meet rapidly changing consumer demands.
 Business Strategy 
 Our goal is to be the most trusted provider of world-class cloud and software-based solutions to service providers around the globe who depend upon the timely and accurate processing of complex, high-volume transactions to operate their business and deliver a superior customer experience. We believe that by successfully executing on this goal we can grow our revenues and earnings, and therefore, create long-term value for our clients, employees, and stockholders. Our strategic focus to accomplish this goal is as follows: 
 Expand Our Leadership Position in Cable and Satellite Markets. While we have a dominant market share position in the North American cable and satellite business already, we believe that we can expand this share further. Over the past year, we advanced our progress with this initiative with continued subscriber conversions to our platforms and extending our domain expertise and products globally.
 Create More Long-Term, Recurring Relationships Within the Communications Industry. Our relentless, relationship-driven, customer-focused business approach is built on a foundation of respect, integrity, and collaboration. As a result, we enjoy long-term relationships with many of the world’s leading CSPs based on a true partnership aimed at helping providers enable sustainable growth, create efficiencies, and deliver differentiated services to their customers. We have seen successful adoption of our managed services approach with global CSPs based upon our compelling value proposition and proven track record.
 Expand Our Product and Services Portfolio Through Continuous Innovation. We believe that our product technology, cloud-based solutions, and pre-integrated suite of solutions give service providers a competitive advantage. Our solutions allow providers to effectively manage their traditional businesses while being able to also quickly deliver new digital services directly to consumers with a modern, personalized, branded experience driving customer satisfaction, and loyalty. We continually add new, relevant capabilities to what we do as a company, both in terms of our people and our solutions. By doing this, we build very strong recurring relationships which are difficult for our competitors to displace.

Our track record of doing what we say we are going to do has enabled us to be a trusted advisor and integral member of our clients’ operations. 
 Bring New Skills and Talents to Market. In order to help our clients manage the rapid pace of change in the communications industry, we invest in our people so that they are prepared to bring the highest quality technical skills, interpersonal skills, and managerial skills to our business and our clients. 
 In summary, we are focused on helping our clients compete more effectively and successfully in an ever-changing market. 
 Description of Business 
 Key Clients. We work with the leading communication providers located around the world. A partial list of those service providers as of December 31, 2016 is included below:
 
 
América Móvil | Mediacom Communications
------------------------------------------+------------------------
Bell Canada TV | MTN 
Bharti Airtel | Singtel 
Cable One Inc. | Telefônica 
Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”) | Telstra 
Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) | Verizon 
DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”) | Vodafone 
Hutchinson Whampoa 3G | 

 The North American communications industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past decade, resulting in a large percentage of the market being served by a limited number of service providers with greater size and scale, and there are possibilities of further consolidation, illustrated by the acquisition of Time Warner Cable, Inc. (“Time Warner”) by Charter. Consistent with this market concentration and our heritage in serving the North American cable and satellite markets, a large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our three largest clients, as shown in the table below. Clients that represented 10% or more of our revenues for 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions, except percentages): 
 
 
 | 2016 | | 2015 
-----------------------------------------------+--------+-----+--------------
 | Amount | | % of Revenues | | Amount | | % of Revenues
Comcast | $ | 195 | | 26 | % | $ | 177 | 24 | %
Charter/Time Warner (combined for all periods) | | 160 | | 21 | % | | 155 | 21 | %
DISH | | 102 | | 13 | % | | 107 | 14 | %

 See the Significant Client Relationships section of our MD&A for additional information regarding our business relationships with these key clients. 
 Research and Development. Our clients around the world are facing competition from new entrants and at the same time, are deploying new services at a rapid pace and dramatically increasing the complexity of their business operations. Therefore, we continue to make meaningful investments in R&D to ensure that we stay ahead of our clients’ needs and advance our clients’ businesses as well as our own. We recognize these challenges and believe our value proposition is to provide solutions that help our clients ensure that each customer interaction is an opportunity to create value and deepen the business relationship. As a result of our R&D efforts, we have broadened our footprint within our client base with many new innovative product offerings. 
 Our total R&D expenses for 2016 and 2015 were $98.7 million and $102.0 million, respectively, or approximately 13% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenues. We anticipate the level of R&D investment to trend up due to the heightened level of our planned investments for 2017.
 There are certain inherent risks associated with significant technological innovations. Some of these risks are described in this report in our Risk Factors section below.

Sales and Marketing. We organize our sales efforts to clients primarily within our geographically dispersed, dedicated account teams, with senior level account managers who are responsible for new revenues and renewal of existing contracts within a client account. The account teams are supported by sales support personnel who are experienced in the various products and services that we provide. 
 Competition. The market for business support solutions products and services in the communications industry, as well as in other industries we serve, is highly competitive. We compete with both independent providers and in-house developers of customer management systems. We believe that our most significant competitors in our primary markets are Amdocs Limited and NEC Corporation; network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Huawei; and internally-developed solutions. Some of our actual and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, and technological resources than us and in some instances we may actually partner and collaborate with our competitors on large opportunities and projects. 
 We believe service providers in our industry use the following criteria when selecting a vendor for the mission critical management of their revenue, customer interactions and digital ecosystem: (i) functionality, scalability, flexibility, interoperability, and architecture of the software assets; (ii) the breadth and depth of pre-integrated product solutions; (iii) product quality, client service, and support; (iv) operational excellence and reliability; (v) quality of R&D efforts; and (vi) total cost of ownership. We believe that our products and services allow us to compete effectively in these areas. 
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, and patent laws in the United States (“U.S.”) and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality, and other types of contractual arrangements to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our solutions. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or misappropriated. Although we hold a limited number of patents and patent applications on some of our newer solutions, we do not rely upon patents as a primary means of protecting our rights in our intellectual property. In any event, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Also, much of our business and many of our solutions rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms. Our failure to adequately establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For a description of the risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors - Failure to Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights or Claims by Others That We Infringe Their Intellectual Property Rights Could Substantially Harm Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 3,312 employees, an increase of 35 employees when compared to the number of employees we had as of December 31, 2015. Our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We are subject to various foreign employment laws and regulations based on the country in which our employees are located. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
