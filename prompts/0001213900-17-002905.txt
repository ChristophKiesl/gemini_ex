Our digital marketing technology and solutions are deployed in and have application across diverse categories: automotive, apparel and accessories, banking, baby/children, beauty, consumer products, department stores, electronics, fashion, fitness, foodservice/quick service restaurants, financial services, gaming, luxury retail, mass merchants, mobile operators, and pharmacy retail The industries in which we sell our solutions are established, but the planning, development, implementation and maintenance of technology-enabled experiences involving combinations of digital marketing technologies is relatively new and evolving. Moreover, a number of participants in these industries have only recently started considering or expanding the adoption of these types of technologies, solutions and experiences as part of their overall marketing strategies. As a result, we remain an early stage company without an established history of profitability.
 
We believe that the adoption and evolution of digital marketing technology and solutions will increase substantially in years to come both in the industries or categories on which we currently focus and in others. We also believe that adoption of our technology and solutions depends upon not only the services and solutions that we provide, but also depends heavily upon the cost of hardware used to process and display content on them. While the costs of hardware configurations and software media players have historically decreased and we believe they will continue to do so at an accelerating rate, flat panel displays typically constitute a large portion of the expenditure customers make relative to the entire cost of implementing a digital marketing system implementation and can be a barrier to customer deployment. As a result, we believe that the broader adoption of digital marketing technology solutions is likely to increase, although we cannot predict the rate at which such adoption will occur.
 
Another key component of our business strategy, especially given the evolving industry dynamics in which we operate, is to acquire and integrate other operating companies in the industry in conjunction with pursuing our organic growth objectives. We believe that the selective acquisition and successful integration of certain companies will accelerate our growth; enable us to aggregate multiple customer bases onto a single business and technology platform; provide us with greater operating scale; enable us to leverage a common set of processes, tools, and cost efficiencies; and ultimately result in higher operating profitability and cash flow from operations. Our management team is actively pursuing and evaluating alternative acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis. Our management team and Board of Directors have broad experience with the execution, integration and financing of acquisitions. We believe that, based on the foregoing and other factors, the Company can successfully serve as a consolidator of multiple business and technology platforms serving similar markets.
 
Our company sells products and services primarily throughout North America.
 
Corporate Organization
 
Our principal offices are located at 13100 Magisterial Drive, Ste 100, Louisville, Kentucky 40223, and our telephone number at that office is (502) 791-8800.
 
The legal entity that is the registrant was originally incorporated and organized as a Minnesota corporation under the name Wireless Ronin Technologies, Inc. in March 2003. Our business initially focused on the provision of expertise digital media marketing solutions to customers, including digital signage, interactive kiosks, mobile, social media and web-based media solutions. We acquired the assets and business of Broadcast International, Inc., a Utah corporation and public registrant, through a merger transaction that was effective as of August 1, 2014. Then on August 20, 2014, we consummated a merger transaction with Creative Realities, LLC, a privately owned Delaware limited liability company, in which we issued a majority of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In that merger transaction, we acquired the interactive marketing technology business of Creative Realities that we currently operate. Shortly after that merger, we changed our corporate name from Wireless Ronin Technologies, Inc. to “Creative Realities, Inc.” On October 15, 2015, we acquired the assets and business of ConeXus World Global, LLC, a privately owned Kentucky limited liability company for which we issued preferred and common stock. In that merger transaction, we acquired the systems integration and marketing technology business of ConeXus World that we currently operate. On May 23, 2016, we dissolved Broadcast International, Inc.

Recent Acquisitions
 
Acquisition of ConeXus World Global
 
On October 15, 2015, we completed the acquisition of ConeXus World Global, LLC for 2,080,000 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, and the conversion of $823 of ConeXus World Global debt into (i) 2,639,258 shares of our common stock, and (ii) $150 in principal amount of our convertible debt. As a result of the merger transaction, ConeXus World Global, LLC is now our wholly owned operating subsidiary. The merger was completed by the filing of articles of merger with the Kentucky Secretary of State.
 
The debtholders and members of ConeXus received a total of 1,664,000 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00, and 16,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01. In accordance with the terms of the amendment to the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization, an additional 416,000 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock and 4,000,000 shares of common stock, collectively referred to as holdback shares, were to be issued immediately upon the reorganization of the capital structure of a Belgian affiliate of ConeXus. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, this reorganization has not occurred and the Company will not be acquiring the ConeXus Belgian affiliate. Therefore, no liability has been recorded for these additional shares, the consideration has not been included in the purchase price allocation and the financial results of the Belgian affiliate have not been included in the consolidated financial statements.
 
As used throughout this report, the “Company” generally refers to the registrant (Creative Realities, Inc., formerly known as Wireless Ronin Technologies, Inc.), unless the context otherwise indicates or requires. Use of the first person “we” refers to the Company or, if the context so requires, to the historical business of Creative Realities or the registrant itself, in each case prior to the consummation of the August 20, 2014 merger transaction.
 
Financing Arrangements
 
Factoring Agreement
 
On October 15, 2015, we entered into a Factoring Agreement with Allied Affiliated Funding, L.P. Under the Factoring Agreement, Allied Affiliated Funding, or “Allied,” was permitted, but not required to purchase approved receivables from the Company and its subsidiaries up to a maximum amount of $3.0 million. Upon receipt of any advance under the Factoring Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries sold and assigned all of their rights in such receivables and all proceeds thereof to Allied, with recourse. The purchase price for receivables bought and sold under the Factoring Agreement was equal to their face amount less a 1.10% base discount. Added to the base discount was an additional .037% discount from the face value of a receivable for each day beyond 30 days that the receivable remained unpaid by the account debtor. The base discount was subject to adjustment in the event of changes in the prime lending rate as published by The Wall Street Journal. Allied provided advances under the Factoring Agreement net of an applicable reserve amount, as specified in the agreement. The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under the Factoring Agreement were secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Allied had the right under the Factoring Agreement to require the Company to repurchase any receivable earlier sold for a purchase price equal to the face value of the receivable. The Factoring Agreement had an initial term of one year, subject to potential one-year renewals thereafter, unless earlier terminated (or not renewed) in accordance with the agreement. The Company terminated the Factoring Agreement on August 17, 2016, upon payment to Allied of an early termination fee equal to $37.5.

Our principal subsidiaries — Creative Realities, LLC, Wireless Ronin Technologies Canada, Inc., and Conexus World Global, LLC — were also parties to the Securities Purchase Agreement and are co-makers of the secured convertible promissory notes. Obligations under the secured convertible promissory notes are secured by a grant of collateral security in all of the personal property of the co-makers pursuant to the terms of a security agreement. The secured convertible promissory notes bear interest at the rate of 14% per annum. Of this amount, 12% per annum is payable monthly in cash, and the remaining 2% per annum is payable in the form an additional principal through increases in the principal amount of the note. Upon the consummation of a change in control transaction of the company or a default, interest on the secured convertible promissory note will increase to the rate of 17% per annum. The secured convertible promissory note matures on April 15, 2017, unless the holder of a note elects to extend the maturity date for an additional six-month period, in which case such note will mature on October 15, 2017. On January 17, 2017, Slipstream Communications, LLC elected to extend the maturity date of the convertible promissory notes to October 15, 2017. At any time prior to the maturity date, the holder of a promissory note may convert the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest into our common stock at its conversion rate. We may not prepay the secured convertible promissory note prior to the maturity date. The secured convertible promissory note contains other customary terms.

Business Strategy
 
We believe that our existing business model is highly scalable and can be expanded successfully as we continue to grow organically and integrate our recent merger transactions, strengthen our operational practices and procedures, further streamline our administrative office functions, and continue to capitalize on various marketing programs and activities.
Industry Background
 
Over approximately the past 18-24 months, we believe certain digital marketing technology industry trends are creating the opportunity for retailers, brands, venue-operators, enterprises, non-profits and other organizations to create innovative shopping, marketing, and informational experiences for their customers and other stakeholders in various venues worldwide. These trends include: (i) the expectations of technology-savvy consumers; (ii) addressing on-line competitors by improving physical experiences (iii) accelerating decline in the cost of hardware configurations (primarily flat panel displays) and software media players; (ii) the continued evolution of mobile, social, software and hardware technologies, applications and tools; (iii) the increasing sophistication of social networking platforms; (iv) increasingly complex customer requirements related to their specific digital marketing technology and solution objectives; and (v) customers challenging service providers with the delivery of a satisfactory consumer experience with the traditional pressure on reducing installation and ongoing operating costs.

As a result, a growing number of retailers, brands, venue-operators and other organizations have identified the need and opportunity to implement increasingly cost-effective and “sales-lifting” digital marketing, and interactive experiences to market to their customers. These include creating unique and customized experiences for targeted, timely offerings and relevant promotions; improving engagement resulting in increased sales; and increasing shopping basket size. We believe our clients consider capitalizing on these industry trends to be increasingly critical to any successful “store of the future” retail and brand sales environment, especially where sales staff turnover is high, training outcomes are inconsistent and product knowledge is low.
 
Companies are accomplishing their strategies by implementing various digital marketing technology solutions, which: are implemented in multiple forms and types of configurations and locations; attempt to achieve any of a broad range of individual or combination of objectives; contain various levels of targeting; have the ability to instantly manage single or multiple locations remotely from a customer’s desktop or other connected device at each location; and are built to deliver or contain a standard or customized experience unique to and within the customer’s environment. Examples of such solutions include:
 

● | Digital Merchandising Systems, which aim to inform and interact with customers through various types of content in an integrated experience, improve in-store customer experiences and increase overall sales, upsells, and/or cross-sales; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Digital Sales Assistants, which aim to replace or augment existing sales resources and the level of interactive and informational sales assistance inside the store; 
● | Digital Way-Finders, which aim to help customers navigate their way around individual retail stores and multi-store locations or venues, or within individual brand categories; 
● | Digital Kiosks, which aim to provide data, specialized and customized broadcasts, promotional information and coupons, train, and other forms of information and interaction with customers in a variety of deployment forms, types, configurations and experiences; 
● | Digital Menu-Board Systems, which aim to enable various types of restaurant operators the ability to remotely and on a scheduled basis, update and modify menu information, promotions, and other forms of content dynamically; 
● | Dynamic Digital Signage which aims to deliver and manage in-store marketing and advertising campaigns, specialized and customized broadcasts, and various other forms of messaging targeting customers in a particular experience or environment. 

Our Markets
 
We currently market and sell our marketing technology solutions through our direct sales force and word-of-mouth referrals from existing customers. Select strategic partnerships and lead generation programs also drive business to the Company through targeted business development initiatives. We market to companies that seek digital marketing solutions across multiple connected devices and who specifically seek or could benefit from enhancements to the customer experience offered in their stores, venues, brands or organizations.
 
Our digital marketing technology solutions have application in a wide variety of industries. The industries in which we sell our solutions are established and include hospitality, branded retail, automotive, food service and retail healthcare, but the planning, development, implementation and maintenance of technology-enabled experiences is relatively new and evolving.  Moreover, a number of participants in these industries have only recently started considering or expanding the adoption of these types of technologies, solutions and experiences as part of their overall marketing strategies.
 
Seasonality
 
A portion of our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional end of calendar year peak retail sales periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Nevertheless, our revenues can be materially affected by the launch of new markets, the timing of production rollouts, and other factors, any of which have the ability to reduce or outweigh certain seasonal effects.

Effect of General Economic Conditions on our Business
 
We believe that demand for our services will increase in part as a result of recovering retail-related real estate investments and new construction and the recent economic recovery in general. These general economic improvements generally make it easier for our customers to justify decisions to invest in digital marketing technology solutions.
Regulation
 
We are subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies. Such regulation includes radio frequency emission regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the consumer protection laws of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, product safety regulatory activities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, and environmental regulation in areas in which we conduct business. Some of the hardware components that we supply to customers may contain hazardous or regulated substances, such as lead. A number of U.S. states have adopted or are considering “takeback” bills addressing the disposal of electronic waste, including CRT style and flat panel monitors and computers. Electronic waste legislation is developing. Some of the bills passed or under consideration may impose on us, or on our customers or suppliers, requirements for disposal of systems we sell and the payment of additional fees to pay costs of disposal and recycling. Presently, we do not believe that any such legislation or proposed legislation will have a materially adverse impact on our business.
Competition 
While we believe there is presently no direct competitor with the comprehensive offering of technologies, solutions and services we provide to our customers, there are multiple individual competitors who offer pieces of our solution stack. These include digital signage software companies such as Stratacache, Four Winds Interactive, and Reflect Systems; marketing services companies such as Sapient Nitro or digital signage systems integrators such as Convergent. Some of these competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. We believe that our sales and business development capabilities, network operations / field service management capabilities, our comprehensive offering of digital marketing technology and solutions, brand awareness, and proprietary processes are the primary factors affecting our competitive position.
