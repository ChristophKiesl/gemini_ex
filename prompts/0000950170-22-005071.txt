 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are one of the pioneer companies in developing the electric pressure pumping industry. We are based in Houston, Texas and provide our services to oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies in the United States. We are one of the first companies to develop and commercially deploy electric-powered pressure pumping technology (“Clean Fleet®”), which we believe is an industry-changing technology. Our Clean Fleet® technology has a demonstrated track record for successful commercial operation, with over 29,900 electric pressure pumping stages completed since the first Clean Fleet® was deployed in July 2014. Our Clean Fleet® technology is supported by an intellectual property portfolio, consisting of 62 granted patents and an additional 201 pending patents. We believe that the following characteristics of the Clean Fleet® technology provide the Company with a distinct competitive advantage:
 •Industry Leading Environmental Profile
 •Reduced Fuel Costs
 •Enhanced Wellsite and Community Safety Profile
 •Lower Cost of Ownership
 •Superior Operational Efficiency Profile
 In May 2021, we announced the next generation of our Clean Fleet® technology with the unveiling of our newly designed Nyx Clean Fleet®. Nyx Clean Fleet® will use our patented PowerCube, driving two independently controlled electric motors and frac pumps to provide 6,000 hydraulic horsepower on a single trailer. We anticipate the first Nyx Clean Fleet® to be delivered in the second quarter of 2022.
Since our announcement in May 2021 of our commitment to becoming an all-electric pressure pumping services provider, we have sold most of our legacy, diesel-powered pressure pumping equipment. We have retained some of our legacy, diesel-powered pressure pumping equipment for use during our transition to support our electric fleets and bridge the time gap between our customers' current service needs and the deployment of our newbuild Nyx Clean Fleets®. Upon delivery, our Nyx Clean Fleets® are intended to replace any conventional fleet in operation.
 We currently have five electric fleets representing 258,350 electric hydraulic horsepower and legacy, diesel-powered equipment representing 90,250 hydraulic horsepower.
Currently, we provide our services in the Appalachian, Permian and Uinta Basins. We have demonstrated the capability to expeditiously deploy our fleets to new oil and gas basins when requested by customers. Our customers include EQT Corporation, Range Resources, Olympus Energy and other leading E&P companies.
 Company Formation
 On February 21, 2012, U.S. Well Services, LLC (“USWS LLC”) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. As part of a corporate restructuring in February 2017, all of the outstanding equity interest of USWS LLC was acquired by a newly formed entity, USWS Holdings, LLC (“USWS Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company that was formed for the purposes of effecting the corporate restructuring and that had no operations of its own. USWS Holdings was acquired by U.S. Well Services, Inc. (f/k/a Matlin & Partners Acquisition Corporation, or “MPAC”) on November 9, 2018, as discussed further under Business Combination herein.
Business Combination
 On March 10, 2016, MPAC was incorporated in Delaware as a special purpose acquisition company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. On March 15, 2017, MPAC consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”), following which its shares began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”).
 On November 9, 2018, MPAC acquired USWS Holdings (the “Transaction”) pursuant to a Merger and Contribution Agreement, dated as of July 13, 2018 (as amended, the “Merger and Contribution Agreement”). The Transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, USWS Holdings was treated as the acquirer and MPAC was treated as the acquired party.
 In connection with the closing of the Transaction, MPAC changed its name to U.S. Well Services, Inc. (“USWS Inc.”) and its trading symbols on Nasdaq from “MPAC,” and “MPACW,” to “USWS” and “USWSW”.

Pursuant to the Merger and Contribution Agreement, on November 9, 2018, USWS Inc. issued Class A common stock to certain members of USWS Holdings in exchange for their interests in USWS Holdings and Class B common stock to certain members of USWS Holdings who retained their interests in USWS Holdings.
Following the completion of the Transaction, the Company was organized as an “Up-C” structure, meaning that substantially all the Company’s assets and operations are held and conducted by USWS LLC. The Transaction did not include a tax receivable agreement.
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the remaining outstanding shares of Class B common stock were converted into shares of Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2021, there were no shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding.
During the first quarter of 2021, the remaining noncontrolling interest holders of USWS Holdings exchanged all of their respective shares for the Company’s Class A common stock. Accordingly, USWS Holdings became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary as of December 31, 2021.
Organizational Structure
 The following diagram illustrates the ownership structure of the Company as of December 31, 2021:

Operations
Our operations are organized into a single business segment, which consists of pressure pumping services, and we have one reportable geographical business segment, the United States.
Services
 We provide pressure pumping services to E&P companies. Pressure pumping services are performed to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability and restricted flow of hydrocarbons. Our customers benefit from our expertise in providing pressure pumping services on horizontal and vertical oil and natural gas-producing wells in shale and other unconventional geological formations.
 The process of pressure pumping involves pumping a pressurized stream of fracturing fluid — typically a mixture of water, chemicals, and proppant — into a well casing or tubing to cause the underground mineral formation to fracture or crack. Fractures release trapped hydrocarbon particles and provide a conductive channel for the oil or natural gas to flow freely to the wellbore for collection. The propping agent, or proppant, becomes lodged in the cracks created by the pressure pumping process, “propping” them open to facilitate the flow of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the well.

Our fleets consist mostly of all-electric, mobile pressure pumping equipment and other auxiliary heavy equipment to perform pressure pumping services. Our Clean Fleet® electric fleets replace the traditional engines, transmissions, and radiators used in conventional diesel fleets with electric motors powered by electricity generated by natural gas-fueled turbine generators. We utilize high-pressure hydraulic fracturing pumps mounted on trailers and refer to the group of pump trailers and other equipment necessary to perform a typical job as a “fleet” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew”.
Since our announcement in May 2021 of our commitment to becoming an all-electric pressure pumping services provider, we have sold most of our legacy, diesel-powered pressure pumping equipment. We have retained some of our legacy, diesel-powered pressure pumping equipment for use during our transition to support our electric fleets and bridge the time gap between our customers' current service needs and the deployment of our newbuild Nyx Clean Fleets®. Upon delivery, our Nyx Clean Fleets® are intended to replace any conventional fleet in operation.
 Clean Fleet® Technology
 Our Clean Fleet® uses electric motors and other existing industry equipment to provide pressure pumping services with numerous advantages over conventional diesel fleets. Our Clean Fleet® technology is a proven technology that has been in commercial operations since July 2014, making us a leading provider of electric-powered pressure pumping services. Our Clean Fleet® technology is supported by an intellectual property portfolio. We have been granted, or have received notice of allowance, for 62 patents and have an additional 201 patents pending.
 We believe Clean Fleet® technology provides the Company with a distinct competitive advantage over our competitors because of the following characteristics:
 •Industry Leading Environmental Profile – Clean Fleet® technology offers superior emissions performance as compared to traditional diesel-powered pressure pumping equipment.
 •Reduced Fuel Costs – Clean Fleet® technology uses electric motors to drive its frac pumps instead of internal combustion engines and transmissions used on traditional, diesel-powered pressure pumping equipment. Clean Fleet®’s electric motors are powered by mobile turbine generators or other power sources that can use natural gas produced and conditioned in the field (“Field Gas”), compressed natural gas (“CNG”), liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) or diesel as a fuel source. Our customers typically provide Field Gas or CNG to fuel Clean Fleet®’s turbine generators, which offers a significant cost savings relative to purchasing diesel fuel to power traditional pressure pumping equipment in the current market environment.
 •Enhanced Wellsite and Community Safety Profile – Clean Fleet® offers superior safety benefits relative to conventional diesel fleets for both workers at the wellsite and inhabitants of nearby communities.
 •Lower Cost of Ownership – We believe Clean Fleet® offers the best cost of ownership of any commercially available pressure pumping technology. Also, Clean Fleet® uses long-lived components such as electric motors, switchgears, and turbine generators that we estimate will be capable of operating for more than 15 years, while conventional diesel fleets can be expected to operate for less than five years before requiring major component replacements.
 •Superior Operational Efficiency Profile – Clean Fleet® technology allows us to garner operational efficiencies that are difficult to achieve with traditional diesel-powered pressure pumping technology. By eliminating moving parts associated with internal combustion engines and transmissions, as well as eliminating the need for preventative maintenance activities such as oil filter changes, we are able to reduce maintenance-related downtime. Additionally, the ability of our Clean Fleet® technology to automatically capture and transmit vast amounts of operational, logistical, and environmental data provide us with insights that offer opportunities for continuous improvements in our operational efficiencies.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following strengths will position us to provide high-quality service to our customers and create value for our stockholders:
 •Proprietary Clean Fleet® technology. We are a market leader in electric pressure pumping technology, with five all-electric fleets. Our fleets utilizing Clean Fleet® technology provide substantial cost savings by replacing diesel fuel with natural gas and offer considerable operational, safety and environmental advantages. Clean Fleet® technology offers superior operational efficiency resulting from reduced non-productive time due to repairs, maintenance and failures associated with diesel-powered engines and transmissions. Additionally, Clean Fleet® technology can substantially reduce emissions of air pollutants and noise from the wellsite. With an increasing focus on ESG and increasing returns by our customers, we believe that adoption of this technology in the near term will materially increase and allow us to continue to significantly expand our market share over the next several years.


•Strong, employee-centered culture. Our employees are critical to our success and are a key source of our competitive advantage. We continuously invest in training and development for our employees, and as a result, we can provide consistent, high-quality service and safe working conditions for both employees and customers.
 •Track record for safety. Safety is a critical element of our operations. We focus on providing customers with the highest quality of service by employing a trained and motivated workforce that is rigorously focused on safety. We continuously review safety data and work to develop and implement policies and procedures that ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate. Our field operators are empowered to stop work and question the safety of a situation or task performed. We use specialized technology to improve safety for our truck drivers and employ measures to mitigate the risk of respirable silica dust exposure on the wellsite. We believe our record of safe operations makes us an attractive partner for both our customers and our employees. Additionally, we continue to take proactive measures to safeguard the physical health of our employees in response to the novel coronavirus 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic. Employees capable of working from home were allowed to do so and all individuals entering a Company facility or work location are required to undergo a screening process. 
 •Strong customer relationships supported by contracts and dedications. We have cultivated strong relationships with a diverse group of customers because of the quality of our service, safety performance and ability to work with customers to establish mutually beneficial service agreements. Our contracts and dedications provide customers with certainty of service pricing, allowing them to efficiently budget and plan the development of their wells. Additionally, our contracts and dedications allow us to maintain higher utilization of our fleet and generate revenue and cash flow through industry cycles. We believe our relationships and the structure of our contracts and dedications position us to continue to build long-term partnerships with customers and support stable financial performance.
 •Modern, high-quality equipment and rigorous maintenance program. Our fleets consist of modern, well-maintained equipment. We invest in high-quality equipment from leading original equipment manufacturers. Moreover, we take proactive measures to maintain the quality of our equipment, using specialized equipment to monitor frac pump integrity and our proprietary FRAC MD® data analytics platform to support preventative maintenance efforts. We believe the quality of our equipment is critical to our ability to provide high quality service to our customers.
 •Proven, cycle-tested management team. Our management team has a proven track record for building and operating oilfield service companies. Our operating and commercial teams have significant industry experience and longstanding relationships with our clients. We believe our management team’s experience and relationships position us to generate business and create value for stockholders. Additionally, our management team’s rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled us to maintain adequate liquidity and develop operational procedures allowing for business continuity during a turbulent market environment.
 Customer Concentration
 Our customers include a broad range of leading E&P companies. For the year ended December 31, 2021, three customers each comprised greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues and collectively represented 50.4% of our consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, five customers each comprised greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues and collectively represented 80.7% of our consolidated revenues.
Suppliers
 We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers from which we procure major equipment components used to maintain, build, or upgrade our custom Clean Fleet® pressure pumping equipment. In addition, some of these components have few suppliers and long lead times to acquire. Certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 It is also possible that supply chain constraints or disruptions will result in significant delivery delays with respect to the equipment that we need to build our new Nyx Clean Fleets®. If we are unable to build out our new Nyx Clean Fleets® as a result of any equipment delivery delays, we may not be in position to enter into contracts with customers, which would negatively impact our results of operations.
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, purchases from our three largest suppliers represented approximately 27.3% of our overall purchases.


Competition
The markets in which we operate are very competitive. We provide services in various geographic regions across the United States, and our competitors include many large and small oilfield service providers. Our pressure pumping services compete with large, integrated companies such as Halliburton Company, as well as other companies including Evolution Well Services, Liberty Oilfield Services Inc., NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., ProFrac Services, LLC and ProPetro Services Inc. In addition, our industry is highly fragmented, and we compete regionally with a significant number of smaller service providers. Although several of our larger competitors have announced their intention to develop or adopt new electric well service technologies, we believe that only the Company and one privately owned competitor are currently significant providers of all-electric pressure pumping services.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are technical expertise, equipment capacity, workforce competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience, and price. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment.
Cyclical Nature of Industry
 We operate in a cyclical industry. The key factor driving demand for our services is the level of well completions by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely on the current and anticipated economics of new well completions. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. E&P companies tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies like us. Increased E&P capital expenditures ultimately lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices which in turn tend to reduce demand for oilfield services. For these reasons, the results of our operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and these fluctuations may distort comparisons of results across periods.
Insurance
 Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of their applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Numerous federal, state, and local governmental agencies issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that could carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in permit revocations or modifications, operational disruptions, or injunctive obligations for noncompliance. These laws and regulations may, for example, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically-sensitive areas and other protected areas, or require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes in the laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof that result in more stringent and costly requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position. We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future.
 Below is an overview of some of the more significant environmental, health and safety requirements with which we must comply. Our customers’ operations are subject to similar laws and regulations. Any material adverse effect of these laws and regulations on our customers’ operations and financial position may also have an indirect material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
 Waste Handling. We engage third parties to handle, transport, store and dispose of wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws and regulations, which impose requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with our own, more stringent requirements. Although certain petroleum production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may be regulated under state law or constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of nonhazardous waste provisions.


Administrative, civil, and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Moreover, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or re-categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production wastes as hazardous wastes. Several environmental organizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production wastes as hazardous. Any such changes in these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
 Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment or, under some state CERCLA-analogous laws, the release of solid waste. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the substance at the facility, and transporters who selected the disposal site. Liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes or contamination, damages to natural resources, and the costs of conducting certain health studies, amongst other things, is strict and joint and several. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. During our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state laws. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such substances have been released.
 NORM. During our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) associated with oil and gas deposits and accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. NORM exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements.
 Water Discharges. The Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”), or the applicable state. The Clean Water Act has been interpreted by these agencies to apply broadly. Attempting to clarify what constitutes a regulated “water of the United States”, or WOTUS, the EPA and the Corps promulgated the Clean Water Rule in 2015. Following legal challenges and political maneuverings, the Clean Water Rule was repealed and replaced with the final Navigable Waters Protection Rule (the “NWPR”) in 2020. The NWPR revised and narrowed the WOTUS definition. The NWPR was vacated by an Arizona district court in August 2021, and the agencies announced they would halt implementation of the NWPR and revert to pre-2015 WOTUS interpretation, which is broader than the NWPR. On December 21, 2021, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule in the Federal Register that, once finalized, will formally re-establish the pre-2015 WOTUS definition, with some updates to reflect consideration of Supreme Court decisions. In the proposed rulemaking, the agencies indicated they anticipate a second, future rulemaking that would build upon the foundation of the proposed rule. We expect political maneuverings and litigation regarding the WOTUS definition to continue, creating uncertainty as to what constitutes a protected “water of the United States.” In addition, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters.
 Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other emissions control requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants from specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs to remain in compliance. These and other laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities where we operate, and significant administrative, civil, and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with air regulations. Obtaining or renewing permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.


Climate Change. The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because such gases contribute to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented, and continues to adopt and implement, regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA also requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain large sources of GHG emissions in the United States, including certain oil and gas production facilities. The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs and through the establishment of emissions reduction targets. In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. The United States exited the Paris Agreement in November 2020, but rejoined it effective on February 19, 2021. Additional federal and/or state regulations targeting climate change could significantly affect our operations or compliance costs.
 Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.
 Endangered and Threatened Species. Environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state laws may impact exploration, development, and production activities in areas where we operate. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and various state analogs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may identify previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species, or a state may impose new rules limiting oil and gas operations to protect wildlife or habitat, which could cause us or our customers to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or operating bans in the affected areas.
 Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Related Activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, on January 20, 2021, the Biden administration issued an order implementing a 60-day suspension on new oil and gas leases and drilling permits for federal lands and water. On January 27, 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order that indefinitely pauses new oil and gas leases on federal lands while the administration undertakes a comprehensive review on climate change impacts. In June 2021, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction to block the leasing pause. The Biden administration resumed approving oil and gas drilling permits on federal lands but is appealing the ruling. Additionally, beginning in August 2012, the EPA issued a series of rules under the CAA that establish new emission control requirements for certain oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations and associated equipment. Various political maneuverings resulted in September 2020 amendments to New Source Performance Standards issued in 2016. These amendments were reversed in June 2021, following a joint resolution passed by Congress and signed by President Biden pursuant to the Congressional Review Act. On November 15, 2021, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that would for the first time regulate emissions of methane (a GHG) and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) from existing oil and gas facilities. The proposed rule would also update, strengthen and expand existing rules applicable to new, reconstructed and modified oil and gas facilities. The agency did not provide proposed regulatory text in the proposed rule, but instead sought public comments for a supplemental proposal the agency expects to issue in 2022 that may expand on or modify the 2021 proposed rule, including potentially regulating additional sources of methane and VOC emissions, such as abandoned and unplugged wells The U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) finalized similar rules in November 2016 that would have limited methane emissions from new and existing oil and natural gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements. This rule and a September 2018 amendment to it that scaled back the waste-prevention requirements of the 2016 rule were both vacated in 2020 court decisions. In a November 2021 multi-agency Emissions Reduction Action Plan, the Biden administration indicated BLM’s intent to promulgate a rule to disincentivize excessive venting or flaring of gas by requiring oil and gas operators to pay royalties to the federal government for vented or flared gas, and to strengthen financial assurance requirements for oil and gas operators. Moreover, in March 2015, the BLM issued a final rule that sought to impose requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands, including new requirements relating to public disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. However, the BLM rescinded this rule in December 2017. In January 2018, California and a coalition of environmental groups filed suit in the Northern District of California to challenge the BLM’s rescission of the 2015 rule. In March 2020, the California district court upheld the BLM’s rescission of the hydraulic fracturing rule, and the plaintiff groups appealed. This litigation and administrative review of federal hydraulic fracturing regulations is ongoing. Many states also have hydraulic fracturing regulations in place that may be duplicative of the rescinded

federal regulations, and the BLM requires operators to comply with the law of the state where the federal or Indian land is located.
 Further, legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, restrict, or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
Federal and state governments have also begun investigating whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters, and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead the federal government and has led some state governments to develop and implement additional regulations, including stricter regulatory requirements relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells or requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise.
 Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and related activities (whether as a result of the EPA study results or resulting from other factors) could restrict or prohibit our ability to operate in certain areas or subject us and our customers to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and plugging and abandonment requirements. New requirements could result in increased operational costs for us and our customers and reduce the demand for our services.
 OSHA Matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and the public.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 414 full-time employees and no part-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We believe our relationships with our employees are excellent. From time to time, we will utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and/or other services.
Intellectual Property
 We have been granted or have received notice of allowance for 62 patents, which begin to expire in late 2033, and have an additional 201 patents pending. We have filed patents in an effort to protect our Clean Fleet® technology from being duplicated by competitors. These patents should help provide unique competitive advantages in operating areas where noise and emissions are key concerns. We also use proprietary FRAC MD® technology to support our preventative maintenance program and prolong equipment useful life. This technology utilizes specialized equipment to capture and analyze vibrations to identify component stress so maintenance can be performed prior to catastrophic failures. Our fleets continuously transmit data captured in the field to our IoT platform. This data is analyzed by our team of data scientists in order improve our operations by garnering insights that inform real-time decision making in the field and drive our machine learning capabilities to increase efficiency and extend equipment useful life.
