Item 1. Business.
Overview

Throughout this document, references to “Cantel,” “us,” “we,” “our” and the “Company” are references to Cantel Medical Corp. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear the reference is to Cantel Medical Corp. itself and not its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Form 10-K to 2020, 2019, 2018 or “fiscal” 2020, 2019, 2018 or other years refer to our fiscal year ended July 31, of that respective year, and references to “fiscal” 2021 refer to our fiscal year ending July 31, 2021.
Cantel is a leading provider of infection prevention products and services in the healthcare market, specializing in the following reportable segments: Medical, Life Sciences, Dental and Dialysis. Most of our equipment, consumables and supplies are used to help prevent the occurrence or spread of infections. We operate our four segments through wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States and internationally.
Cantel 2.0
During fiscal 2020, we announced a new set of initiatives titled “Cantel 2.0” representing key strategic priorities for the next several years. Among these commercial priorities are a new focus on sales into ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”), enhanced focus on driving the adoption of the “Complete Circle of Protection” portfolio for large hospital systems and the expanded penetration of our procedure products into Europe. 
COVID-19 
The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global economy and has had, and will continue to have a significant direct and indirect effect on our businesses and operations. The extent to which these events may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and many of which are outside our control. Such developments include the ultimate geographic spread and duration of the pandemic, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 virus, the effectiveness and intensity of measures to contain the COVID-19 virus and address its impacts, and the economic impact of the pandemic and the reactions to it. Such developments, among others, depending on their nature, duration and intensity, have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” for further discussion on COVID-19.
To date, we have been able to continue our operations with limited disruptions to supply and manufacturing. Although it is difficult to predict the broad macroeconomic effects that the COVID-19 virus will have on industries or individual companies, we have assessed the possible effects and outcomes of the pandemic on, among other things, our supply chain, customers and distributors, discounts and rebates, employee base, product sustainability, research and development efforts, product pipeline and consumer demand. We have implemented several measures to proactively reduce operating costs, conserve liquidity and navigate through this unprecedented situation. These management cost reduction measures include salary reductions, employee furloughs, reductions to travel and expenses and the deferral of certain operating and capital expenditures.

•other consumables, accessories and supplies used to high-level disinfect rigid endoscopes, flexible endoscopes and other instrumentation, and
•technical maintenance service on our products.
    Our endoscopy procedure products are designed to eliminate the challenges associated with proper cleaning and high-level disinfection of numerous reusable components used in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy procedures. Our procedure products include:
•CO2 and water irrigation pumps and disposable procedure kits,
•sterile irrigation tubing, and
•single-use valves.
Our endoscopy products, most of which are proprietary medical devices subject to rigorous standards and regulations, contribute to the safe and effective use of endoscopes in healthcare facilities throughout the world and improve the quality of healthcare delivery by reducing the threat of nosocomial (hospital/healthcare facility acquired) infections. In addition, our disposable procedure products provide greater patient safety and infection prevention through the replacement of reusable devices requiring disinfection with our single-use products. In particular, such products are intended to reduce the challenges associated with proper cleaning and high-level disinfection of numerous reusable components used in GI endoscopy procedures.
We design, develop and manufacture most of our endoscopy products. Our Medical segment offers various preventative maintenance programs, repair services and user training programs to support the effective operation of reprocessing systems over their lifetime. Our field service personnel and international third-party distributors install, maintain, upgrade and repair equipment.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution. We sell and service our full line of endoscopy products through our direct field sales and clinical support service organizations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Hong Kong and Dubai. Elsewhere in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, we sell primarily through independent distribution partners. In China, we sell both directly and through distributors, based on regional market demands.
Competition. We compete with a number of large companies that have significant product portfolios, market share and global reach, which enable them to offer wide-ranging product bundles to larger customers, such as Group Purchasing Organizations (“GPOs”) and Integrated Delivery Networks (“IDNs”). This competition has the potential to impact our net sales, market share and profit margin. We also compete with a number of small companies with very limited product offerings and operations in one or a limited number of countries. On a product basis, our principal competitors are Steris, Olympus, Boston Scientific, ASP (a division of Fortiv), Metrex, Ruhof, Ecolab, ERBE, Getinge, SteelCo and Wassenburg. We believe that our principal competitive advantages include the strength of our dedicated sales teams, our comprehensive product line of differentiated automated endoscope reprocessors, disposable procedure products and proprietary chemistries, and our reputation for providing high-quality and reliable products supported by our highly responsive clinical support and service teams.
Acquisitions. On March 21, 2018, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding stock of Aexis Medical BVBA (“Aexis Medical”), which is based in Belgium. Aexis Medical specializes in advanced software solutions focused on the tracking and monitoring of instrument reprocessing for hospitals and healthcare professionals.
Life Sciences
General. Our Life Sciences segment designs, develops, manufactures, sells and installs water purification systems for medical and other bacteria controlled applications.

(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 


Cantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K

•microbiological testing services, and
•clean-room certification and decontamination services.
Our products are generally designed for dialysis and other specific healthcare applications, research laboratories, food and beverage, and commercial industrial customers. Our water systems provide biologically pure water specific to our customers’ needs and site conditions, ranging from low-volume, reverse osmosis (“RO”) and deionization systems, to high-volume, complete turnkey purification systems. We provide service and maintenance for water purification systems through an extensive network of regional offices in the United States and, to a smaller degree, in Canada.
Our expertise includes designing systems capable of delivering water for hemodialysis that meets the water quality standards and good manufacturing standards of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (“AAMI”) and all grades of U.S. Pharmacopeia (“USP”) water (i.e., water meeting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) enforced standards of the USP including “USP Purified Water,” which is a FDA requirement for the labeling of “purified” bottled water). We also package these same technologies and expertise in industrial designs to meet the commercial industrial market requirements.
We also offer a full line of proprietary and third party filters utilizing hollow fiber membrane technology to remove impurities from liquid streams for a wide range of applications. Such applications include the filtering of ultrapure water to remove endotoxins, bacteria and other contaminants in medical environments to provide protection for patients undergoing treatments that use ultrapure water. Our therapeutic filtration products include hemoconcentrators, hemofilters and specialty filters utilized for therapeutic medical applications.
Our liquid disinfectant and cold sterilant products are used in the dialysis, medical, pharmaceutical and other industries. These products include surface disinfectants as well as chemistries used to disinfect ultrapure water systems as part of overall procedures to control the contamination of systems by microorganisms and spores. Our “Dry Fog” equipment dispenses our cold sterilant products in a micro-mist form into rooms and certain structures with complex geometries in order to achieve validated surface disinfection.
Our REVOX® Sterilization Systems and Services business provides an innovative room-temperature vapor sterilization method for use by medical device, pharmaceutical and biomedical industries. This technology provides the capability to sterilize products at room temperature, while reducing overall processing times and inventory and capital requirements associated with other industrial sterilization methods.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution. We generally sell our equipment on a direct basis in the United States and Canada and through third-party distributors in other international markets. We are a leading supplier of FDA 510(k) cleared water purification systems to the dialysis industry in North America. A significant portion of our sales in this segment are derived from sales of products and service to dialysis clinics and hospitals in North America.
Competition. We compete with a number of large companies that have significant product portfolios and global reach, as well as a number of small companies with very limited product offerings and operations in one or a limited number of countries. On a product basis, competitors include Evoqua, IsoPure, Baxter and Steris. We believe that the ability of our Life Sciences segment to successfully compete in the water purification, filtration and disinfectant markets derives from our expertise in a FDA regulated environment, our broad product offerings, the high quality of our products and our national service coverage.
We have observed a continued trend toward formal or informal bundling partnerships and arrangements between kidney dialysis machine suppliers and companies offering medical water purification systems that compete with our systems. The ability to bundle these products offers a competitive advantage to such suppliers, which include Baxter (dialysis machine)/Gambro (water system), B. Braun (dialysis machine)/Lauer (water system), and Fresenius (dialysis machine)/Vivonic (water system). The bundling approach being used in the United States by B. Braun/Lauer represents a competitive threat to our dialysis water business, as does the business combination of Fresenius and Vivonic. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Acquisitions. On August 1, 2018, we acquired certain net assets of Stericycle Inc. related to its controlled environmental solutions business (“CES Business”). The CES Business is a leading provider of testing and certification, environmental monitoring and decontamination services for clean rooms and other controlled environments to ensure safety, regulatory compliance and quality control.

Although our dental business historically depended significantly on PPE and sterility assurance, with recent acquisitions (discussed below), our business has been diversified to cover the broader lifecycle of dental instrumentation, reprocessing and infection control. 
Through Hu-Friedy Mfg. Co. LLC (“Hu-Friedy”), we are known as a global leader in hand dental instruments and infection control, providing related products, information and education through our innovative Greenlight Dental Compliance Center® online portal. Hu-Friedy was a pioneer in bringing its Instrument Management System and practices designed to make the reprocessing of dental instruments safer, more efficient and more effective.
Our Crosstex brand is a supplier of primarily single-use products, including PPE, such as surgical masks, gowns, tray liners, barriers, sterilization wraps and pouches and chemistries, such as surface disinfectants and cleaning products.
 Our sterility assurance business includes biological indicators, chemical integrators and related products, both mail-in lab services and in-office biological monitoring (spore test) systems enabling hospitals, surgical centers, office-based practitioners and dental facilities to safely and accurately monitor and verify their sterilization practices and protocols.
Through Accutron, we supply nitrous oxide sedation systems and related consumables, such as sedation masks.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution. Our dental products are sold globally to approximately 350 wholesale customers in over 100 countries. Our distribution partners primarily include major healthcare distributors, with some GPOs and buying co-operatives that sell our products to dental practices, medical facilities, veterinary clinics, and government and educational institutions. We sell dental products directly to educational institutions, government agencies and community health centers. Hu-Friedy maintains an especially strong presence in dental schools. The majority of our dental products are sold under our brand names. We also have a significant business in supplying private label products for several of our distribution partners and for other dental brand manufacturers. 
Competition. We compete with a number of large companies that have significant product portfolios and global reach, as well as a number of small companies with very limited product offerings. On a product basis, competitors include Halyard Health, 3M, ASP, Steris, Danaher/Sybron, Dentsply/Sultan Healthcare, Amcor, Porter Instrument, Sterisil, ProEdge, J&J/Ethicon, LM Dental, Medicom, Young Dental, Braun/Aesculap and less expensive imported generic products from Asia and other lower cost manufacturing locations. We believe that our long-standing brands, product quality, superior customer service and breadth of portfolio are competitive advantages, and are the basis for our success in this segment.
(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 


Cantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Acquisitions. On October 1, 2019, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Hu-Friedy. Hu-Friedy is a leading global manufacturer of instruments and instrument reprocessing systems serving the dental industry.
On February 1, 2019, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding stock of Omnia S.p.A. (“Omnia”), an Italian-based leader in dental surgical consumables solutions. Omnia’s business consists of a wide-ranging portfolio of sutures, irrigation tubing and customized dental surgical procedure kits, with a focus on procedure room set-up and cross-contamination prevention.
Dialysis
General. We design, develop, manufacture, sell and service reprocessing systems and sterilants for dialyzers (a device serving as an artificial kidney), as well as dialysate concentrates and supplies utilized for renal dialysis. Our renal dialysis products include:
•hemodialysis concentrates and other ancillary supplies,
•medical device reprocessing systems, and
•sterilants and disinfectants.
Our renal dialysis treatment products include a line of acid and bicarbonate concentrates, referred to as dialysate concentrates, used by kidney dialysis centers to prepare dialysate, a chemical solution that draws waste products from the patient’s blood through a dialyzer membrane during the hemodialysis treatment. Dialysate concentrates are used in the dialysis process, whether single-use or reuse dialyzers (described below) are being utilized.
Our dialyzer reprocessing products are limited to use by centers that choose to clean, disinfect and reuse dialyzers for the same patient, known as “dialyzer reuse,” rather than discard the dialyzers after a single use. There has been a significant downward trend in dialyzer reuse since 2001, which has significantly decreased sales of our dialysis products tied to reuse during that period. We are exploring dialysis-related opportunities with the potential to mitigate the loss of such business. Likewise, we are expanding marketing efforts of reuse products in emerging markets in Asia, South America and elsewhere. However, no assurance can be given that such opportunities and efforts will prove successful. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution. Our products are sold in the United States and, to a significantly lesser extent, throughout the world. Our customer base is comprised of large and small dialysis chains as well as independent dialysis clinics. We sell products in the United States primarily through our own direct distribution network, and in many international markets either directly or under various third-party distribution agreements.
Competition. In our Dialysis segment, our most significant competition comes from manufacturers of single-use dialyzers, particularly Fresenius, the largest dialysis chain in the U.S. and a manufacturer of single-use dialyzers. All or substantially all Fresenius dialysis clinics exclusively use single-use dialyzers and therefore have no need for dialyzer reprocessing equipment. 
Information with Respect to Our Business Generally:
Government Regulation
Our business and products are subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate. In the United States, the FDA, EPA and other governmental authorities regulate the development, manufacture, labeling, sale, storage and distribution of our products and services. Our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation, including country-specific rules and regulations and U.S. regulations applicable to our international operations. Compliance with applicable government regulations is a significant expense for us. 
    Numerous aspects of our business are subject to government regulations including, among other things, research and development, product approvals, product manufacturing, labeling, marketing and promotion, distribution, record-keeping, storage and disposal practices. For example, the FDA inspects medical device manufacturers for compliance with the current Quality Systems Regulations (“QSRs”), which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, introductions of new medical devices are generally subject to regulatory clearance or approval. Failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, such clearance or approvals may hurt our competitiveness and have other material adverse consequences on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 


Cantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K

We cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulations or the interpretation or application of these regulations. However, such governmental regulations could prevent, delay, or result in the revocation or rejection of regulatory clearance of our products. In addition, if we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements, fines, sanctions, regulatory actions and other penalties could be imposed on us.
    We believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental or private action will not have a material adverse effect on us or on our performance, results or financial condition. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, components and other supplies from numerous suppliers in the U.S. and abroad. The principal raw materials and supplies that we use to conduct operations include chemicals, paper, resin, stainless steel and plastic components. These raw materials are generally obtainable from several sources and in sufficient quantities within the lead times specified to vendors.
Intellectual Property
We protect our technology and products by, among other means, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of July 31, 2020, we held 97 U.S. patents and 373 foreign patents, with 53 U.S. patents pending and 107 foreign patents pending. The majority of our U.S. and foreign patents for individual products are effective for twenty years from the initial filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. In addition, we license from independent third parties under patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, the right to manufacture and sell certain of our products. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses (each of which is long-term) are of material importance to our business.
Our products and services are sold around the world under various trade names, trademarks and brand names, which we consider to be valuable in the marketing of our products in each segment. As of July 31, 2020, we had 2,360 trademark registrations in the United States and in various foreign countries in which we conduct business, as well as 26 trademark applications pending worldwide.
Seasonality
Our Dental segment (primarily as a result of the Hu-Friedy acquisition) experiences higher sales volumes during the months of July, August and September as dental schools prepare for their upcoming school year. Our other business segments are not significantly affected by seasonal trends.
Principal Customers
None of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018. As described below, none of our segments are reliant upon a single customer, but some of our segments are currently reliant on a few customers. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Our Life Sciences segment is reliant on two customers, who collectively accounted for approximately 41.7%, 40.2% and 48.0% of segment net sales in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Our Dental segment is reliant on three customers, who collectively accounted for approximately 42.0%, 47.6% and 45.1% of segment net sales in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our Dialysis segment is reliant on two customers (one of which is the same customer noted above under our Life Sciences segment), who collectively accounted for approximately 41.0%, 41.0% and 40.6% of our Dialysis segment net sales in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified) 


Cantel Medical Corp. 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Backlog
As of July 31, 2020, our consolidated backlog was $106,623 compared with $102,925 as of July 31, 2019. The majority of the backlog included our Life Sciences segment, which had backlog of $41,470 and $50,272 as of July 31, 2020 and July 31, 2019, respectively, and our Medical segment, which had a backlog of $41,860 and $33,469 as of July 31, 2020 and July 31, 2019, respectively. The majority of our backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of such date.
Competition
The markets in which our business is conducted are highly competitive. Competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors. Important competitive factors generally include breadth of product offering, product design and quality, safety, ease of use, brand, product service and support, and price. We expect to face continued intense competition and believe that the long-term competitive position for all of our segments depends principally on our success in developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative, cost-effective products and services. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, are well-established with reputations for success in the sale and service of their products, and may have certain other competitive advantages over us. However, we believe that the worldwide reputation for the quality and innovation of our products among customers and our reputation for providing quality product service give us a competitive advantage with respect to many of our products.
In addition, certain companies have developed, or may be expected to develop, new technologies or products that directly or indirectly compete with our products. We anticipate that we may face increased competition in the future as new infection prevention products and services enter the market. Numerous organizations are believed to be working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents. In addition, a number of companies have developed or are developing disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risks of infection and contamination. There can be no assurance that new products or services developed by our competitors will not be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by us in the future. For further discussion of competition-related and other risk factors, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Quality Assurance
We manufacture, assemble and package most of our products in the United States and, to a significantly lesser extent, in Italy, Germany, China and elsewhere. Each of our production facilities is dedicated to particular processes and products. We have implemented quality assurance procedures to support the quality and integrity of our manufacturing process and products. 
Environmental Matters
We anticipate that our compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations, relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will not have any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Employees
As of July 31, 2020, we employed 3,669 persons, of whom 2,527 are located in the United States, 652 are located in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 432 are located in Asia and Australia, and 58 are located in Canada. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Sales to Iran
From time to time, we ship certain of our products to Iran, and conduct related activities, in accordance with licenses issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Iranian sales were generally conducted through distributors, some of whose customers may include public hospitals owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the Iranian government.
