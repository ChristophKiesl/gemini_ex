Inpatient Rehabilitation
We are the nation’s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated and discharged, revenues, and number of hospitals. We provide specialized rehabilitative treatment on both an inpatient and outpatient basis. We operate hospitals in 30 states and Puerto Rico, with concentrations in the eastern half of the United States and Texas. In addition to our hospitals, we manage five inpatient rehabilitation units through management contracts. 
Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals offer specialized rehabilitative care across a wide array of diagnoses and deliver comprehensive, high-quality, cost-effective patient care services. As participants in the Medicare program, our hospitals must comply with various requirements that are discussed below in the “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement—Inpatient Rehabilitation” section. Substantially all (92%) of the patients we serve are admitted from acute care hospitals following physician referrals for specific acute inpatient rehabilitative care. Most of those patients have experienced significant physical and cognitive disabilities or injuries due to medical conditions, such as strokes, hip fractures, and a variety of debilitating neurological conditions, that are generally nondiscretionary in nature and require rehabilitative healthcare services in an inpatient setting. Our teams of highly skilled nurses and physical, occupational, and speech therapists utilize proven technology and clinical protocols with the objective of restoring our patients’ physical and cognitive abilities. Patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by physician orders while case managers monitor each patient’s progress and provide documentation and oversight of patient status, achievement of goals, discharge planning, and functional outcomes. Our hospitals provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical approach to treatment that leads to a higher level of care and superior outcomes.
Home Health and Hospice
Our home health and hospice business is the nation’s fourth largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services in terms of revenues. We acquired EHHI Holdings, Inc. (“EHHI”) and its Encompass Home Health and Hospice business (“Encompass”) on December 31, 2014 and have since transitioned our previously existing HealthSouth home health operations to the Encompass platform and trade name. In the acquisition, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of EHHI, other than equity interests contributed to HealthSouth Home Health Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), a subsidiary of HealthSouth and now indirect parent of EHHI, by certain sellers in exchange for shares of common stock of Holdings. These certain sellers were members of Encompass management, including April Anthony, the chief executive officer of Encompass. These sellers contributed a portion of their shares of common stock of EHHI in exchange for approximately 16.7% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Holdings. We view Encompass as a partnership that brings together the talent and home care experience of the Encompass team with all of the resources and post-acute care experience of HealthSouth.
Encompass operates home health and hospice agencies in 25 states, with concentrations in the Southeast, Oklahoma, and Texas. As participants in the Medicare program, the Encompass agencies must comply with various requirements that are discussed below in the “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement—Home Health” and “—Hospice” sections.
Encompass home health provides a comprehensive range of Medicare-certified home nursing services to adult patients in need of care. These services include, among others, skilled nursing, physical, occupational and speech therapy, medical social work, and home health aide services. Home health patients are frequently referred to us following a stay in an acute care or inpatient rehabilitation hospital or other facility, but many patients are referred from primary care settings and specialty physicians without a preceding inpatient stay. Our patients are typically older adults with two or more chronic conditions and significant functional limitations, and require greater than ten medications. Our team of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, physical, speech and occupational therapists, medical social workers, and home health aides work closely with patients and their families to deliver patient-centered care plans focused on their needs and their goals. 
Encompass also provides hospice services that include in-home services to terminally ill patients and their families. These services address patients’ physical needs, including pain control and symptom management, and provide emotional and spiritual support. Our hospice care teams consist of physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, therapists, home health aides, and volunteers.   
Competitive Strengths
As one of the nation’s largest providers of post-acute healthcare services and with our experience in and focus on those services, we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on, among other things, our broad platform of clinical expertise, the quality of our clinical outcomes, the sustainability of best practices, our financial strength, and the application of technology. We also believe our competitive strengths discussed below give us the ability to adapt and succeed in a healthcare industry facing the uncertainty associated with the efforts to identify and implement workable integrated delivery 
 2

payment models. For example, we are positioned to treat all types of post-acute patients by leveraging our operational expertise across our network of facility- and home-based assets in the event multiple or all post-acute settings (long-term acute care, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing, and home health) face site neutral reimbursement for care provided in the future. Our hospitals have the physical construct (including therapy gym and training areas), clinical staffing, and operating expertise to address the full spectrum of needs for higher acuity post-acute patients needing inpatient care. Encompass can then often treat patients leaving our or other inpatient facilities who need additional post-acute care services in lieu of skilled nursing facility-based care. Additionally, Encompass can serve the lower acuity patients that do not require more intensive facility-based care.

• | People. We believe our approximately 35,710 employees, in particular our highly skilled clinical staff, share a steadfast commitment to providing outstanding care to our patients. We undertake significant efforts to ensure our clinical and support staff receives the education and training necessary to provide the highest quality care in the most cost-effective manner. We also have hospital staff trained for all patient acuity levels faced in the post-acute setting.


• | Quality. We have an extensive base of facility-based and home-based clinical experience from which we have developed best practices and protocols. We believe these clinical best practices and protocols, particularly as leveraged with industry leading technology, help ensure the delivery of consistently high-quality rehabilitative healthcare services. We have developed a program called “TeamWorks,” which is a series of operations-focused initiatives using identified best practices to reduce inefficiencies and improve performance across a wide spectrum of operational areas. We believe these initiatives have enhanced, and will continue to enhance, patient-employee interactions and coordination of care and communication among the patient, the patient’s family, the hospital’s treatment team, other care providers, and payors, which, in turn, improves outcomes and patient satisfaction. One of our primary operational initiatives in 2017 will be a TeamWorks program focused on enhancing clinical collaboration between our hospitals and home health agencies.

Our best practices and protocols have helped our hospitals consistently achieve patient outcomes, such as the rate of discharge to community and average functional improvement, that exceed industry averages. Additionally, our hospitals participate in The Joint Commission's Disease-Specific Care Certification Program. Under this program, Joint Commission accredited organizations, like our hospitals, may seek certification for chronic diseases or conditions such as brain injury or stroke rehabilitation by complying with Joint Commission standards, effectively using evidence-based, clinical practice guidelines to manage and optimize patient care, and using an organized approach to performance measurement and evaluation of clinical outcomes. Obtaining such certifications demonstrates our commitment to excellence in providing disease-specific care. As of December 31, 2016, 101 of our hospitals hold one or more disease-specific certifications, including 99 hospitals with stroke-specific certifications.
In home health, Encompass places a significant emphasis on culture and technology for the purpose of furthering clinical excellence and consistency. Encompass has also developed institutional programs to, among other things, create physician-specific custom treatment protocols and provide care transition from inpatient facilities to home for higher acuity patients. As a result of its efforts, Encompass consistently achieves an acute care readmission rate lower than the industry average along with an average quality of patient care star rating above the industry average. 
The clinical collaboration effort between our inpatient and home health services furthers our pursuit of quality. An important component of this effort has been to place Encompass care transition coordinators in our overlap market hospitals. These highly skilled professionals collaborate with clinicians and case managers in our hospitals to assess patients who may require home health services, facilitate patient choice, and prepare these patients for the care they will receive at home. The coordinators also work with patients’ families to ensure that those family members are prepared to bring their loved ones home safely. 

• | Efficiency and Cost Effectiveness. Our size, technology-enabled business practices, and culture help us provide facility-based and home-based healthcare services on a cost-effective basis. For example, our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals have historically received, on average, a lower per discharge payment from Medicare than the industry average payment while also treating patients with higher average acuity. Our hospitals have also historically averaged significantly less Medicare reimbursement for high cost outlier patients than other inpatient rehabilitation facility (“IRF”) providers have averaged. Specifically, we can leverage our centralized administrative functions, identify best practices, utilize proven staffing models, and take advantage of supply chain efficiencies across our extensive platform of operations. At the location level, we also enjoy economies of scale as our hospitals are often larger (more beds) than industry average. Also, Encompass targets a certain patient density in the markets it serves which contributes to a lower cost per visit than competing publicly-held home

health providers. In addition, our proprietary information systems, discussed below, aggregate data from our business into a comprehensive reporting package and database used by the management teams in our hospitals as well as executive management. Our information systems allow users to analyze data and trends and create custom reports on a timely basis. Likewise, Encompass utilizes Homecare HomebaseSM, an industry-leading information system originally developed by the Encompass management team, to provide home-based care with an emphasis on efficiency and cost effectiveness. 
With a significant presence in both facility-based and home-based healthcare services, we have the opportunity to take advantage of the broader industry focus on reducing costs. Home health and hospice services, which typically have significantly lower cost structures than facility-based care settings, have increasingly been serving larger populations of higher acuity patients than in the past. These home-based services provide a cost-effective alternative to facility-based care where patient acuities do not require a hospital stay. 
Lastly, the combination of home health and hospice with our existing inpatient rehabilitative healthcare services provides us with an increased opportunity to succeed in value-based purchasing programs and to participate in more coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models, such as accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) and bundled payment arrangements. We believe enhanced clinical collaboration between our hospitals and home health agencies offers an excellent means to deliver the quality of care and the cost effectiveness that these new models require to be successful. We have focused, and will continue to focus, on increasing this collaboration. For additional discussion of our participation in these models, including the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative and the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement payment model, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview.”

• | Strong Cash Flow Generation and Balance Sheet. We have a proven track record of generating strong cash flows from operations that have allowed us to successfully implement our growth strategy, reduce our financial leverage, and make significant shareholder distributions. As of December 31, 2016, we have a flexible balance sheet, no significant debt maturities prior to 2020, and ample availability under our revolving credit facility, which along with the cash flows generated from operations should, we believe, provide sufficient support for our business strategy.


• | Technology-Enabled Processes. As a market leader in post-acute healthcare services, we have devoted substantial effort and expertise to leveraging technology to improve patient care and operating efficiencies. We have developed and implemented information technology, such as our rehabilitation-specific electronic clinical information system that we have branded as ACE-IT and our internally developed management reporting system described above that we have branded as BEACON, which we then leverage to enhance our clinical and business processes. For example, part of our clinical data analytics strategy has been the development of a predictive model for identifying patients at risk for acute care transfers. As of December 31, 2016, we have installed ACE-IT in 101 hospitals, and we expect to complete installation in substantially all of our existing hospitals by the end of 2017. We believe ACE-IT will improve patient care and safety, streamline operating efficiencies, and enhance staff recruitment and retention, making it a key competitive differentiator.

Encompass internally developed, and is now a licensee of, Homecare Homebase, a comprehensive information platform that allows home health providers to process clinical, compliance, and marketing information as well as analyze data and trends for management purposes using custom reports on a timely basis. The Encompass team’s knowledge of Homecare Homebase as well as the thorough integration of it into the operating culture allow Encompass to maximize the system’s capability to drive superior clinical, operational, and financial outcomes. Additionally, Encompass offers a number of evidence-based specialty programs, including post-operative care, fall prevention, chronic disease management and transitional care.
We believe our information systems that allow us to collect, analyze, and share information on a timely basis make us an ideal partner for other healthcare providers in a coordinated care delivery environment. Systems such as ACE-IT allow for interoperability with referral sources and health information exchanges. Encompass has a technology platform designed to manage the entire patient work flow and provide valuable data for health system, payor and ACO partners.

Patients and Demographic Trends
Demographic trends, such as population aging, should increase long-term demand for facility-based and home-based post-acute care services. While we treat patients of all ages, most of our patients are 65 and older, and the number of Medicare enrollees is expected to grow approximately 3% per year for the foreseeable future. We believe the demand for facility-based and home-based post-acute care services will continue to increase as the U.S. population ages. We believe these factors align with our strengths in, and focus on, post-acute services. In addition, we believe we can address the demand for facility-based and home-based post-acute care services in markets where we currently do not have a presence by constructing or acquiring new hospitals and by acquiring or opening home health and hospice agencies in that extremely fragmented industry.
Strategy
Our 2016 strategy focused on the following priorities:

• | continuing to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to patients in our existing markets;


• | achieving organic growth at our existing hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies;


• | expanding our services to more patients who require post-acute healthcare services by constructing and acquiring hospitals in new markets and acquiring and opening home health and hospice agencies in new markets;


• | continuing our shareholder distributions via common stock dividends and repurchases of our common stock; and


• | positioning the Company for success in the evolving healthcare delivery system. This preparation included continuing the installation of our electronic clinical information system in our hospitals which allows for interfaces with all major acute care electronic medical record systems and health information exchanges and participating in bundling projects and ACOs.

Total hospital discharges grew 10.8% from 2015 to 2016. Our same-store discharges grew 1.7% during 2016 compared to 2015. Encompass’ home health agencies experienced same-store admissions growth of 13.7% in 2016 as well. We entered new inpatient rehabilitation markets and enhanced our geographic coverage in existing markets in 2016 by adding 4 new hospitals with 161 licensed beds to our portfolio. Likewise, Encompass added another 10 home health and 8 hospice locations. In addition to our new hospitals and agencies added in 2016, we integrated the significant acquisitions of the hospitals of Reliant Hospital Partners, LLC and the home care operations of CareSouth Health System, Inc. made in late 2015.
In 2016, we further positioned ourselves for the healthcare industry’s movement to integrated delivery payment models, value-based purchasing, and post-acute site neutrality. We installed ACE-IT in 20 hospitals. We deployed and coordinated clinical protocols and discharge planning between our hospitals and home health agencies. We increased the clinical collaboration rate between our hospitals and our home health agencies. Within our inpatient rehabilitation segment, we initiated development of a predictive model to identify patients at risk for acute care transfer. We implemented a multidisciplinary medication reconciliation process using ACE-IT. Our hospitals and agencies also participated in bundling and ACO alternative payment models in various markets, and we developed a form of collaborator agreement to facilitate entering into arrangements with acute care hospitals participating in bundled payment projects.
Many of our quality and outcome measures remained above both inpatient rehabilitation and home health industry averages. Not only did we treat more patients and enhance outcomes, we did so in a cost-effective manner. For additional discussion of the pursuit of our 2016 strategic priorities, including operating results, growth, and shareholder value-enhancing achievements, as well as our 2017 strategy and business outlook, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview,” “Results of Operations,” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 27,968 individuals, of whom approximately 17,187 were full-time employees, in our inpatient rehabilitation business and approximately 7,742 individuals, of whom approximately 5,698 were full-time employees, in the Encompass home health and hospice business. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions relating to employment. Except for approximately 63 employees at one hospital (about 17% of that hospital’s workforce), none of our employees are represented by a labor union as of December 31, 2016. Like most healthcare providers, our labor costs are rising faster than the general inflation rate. In some markets, the lack of availability of medical personnel is a significant operating issue facing healthcare providers. To address this 
 5

challenge, we will continue to focus on maintaining the competitiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and improving our recruitment, retention, and productivity. Shortages of nurses and other medical personnel, including therapists, may, from time to time, require us to increase utilization of more expensive temporary personnel, which we refer to as “contract labor,” and other types of premium pay programs.
Competition
Inpatient Rehabilitation. The inpatient rehabilitation industry, outside our leading position, is highly fragmented. Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals compete primarily with rehabilitation units, many of which are within acute care hospitals, in the markets we serve. For a list of our markets by state, see the table in Item 2, Properties. There are some smaller privately held companies that compete with us primarily in select geographic markets in Texas and the West. In addition, there are two public companies that are primarily focused on other post-acute care services but also own or operate between 15 and 20 inpatient rehabilitation facilities each, one of which also manages the operations of inpatient rehabilitation facilities as part of its business model. Other providers of post-acute care services may attempt to become competitors in the future. For example, over the past few years, the number of nursing homes marketing themselves as offering certain rehabilitation services has increased even though nursing homes are not required to offer the same level of care, or be licensed, as hospitals. Also, acute care hospitals, including those owned or operated by large public companies or not-for-profits that have dominant positions in specific markets, may choose to expand their post-acute rehabilitation services. The primary competitive factors in any given market include the quality of care and service provided, the treatment outcomes achieved, and the relationship and reputation with the acute care hospitals in the market. The ability to work as part of an integrated delivery payment model with other providers is likely to become an increasingly important factor in competition. See the “Regulation—Relationships with Physicians and Other Providers” section below for further discussion. Additionally, for a discussion regarding the effects of certificate of need requirements on competition in some states, see the “Regulation—Certificates of Need” section below.
Home Health and Hospice. Similarly, the home health and hospice services industry is highly competitive and fragmented. There are more than 12,300 home health agencies and approximately 4,200 hospice agencies nationwide certified to participate in Medicare. Encompass is the fourth largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services in the United States. For a list of the Encompass home health markets by state, see the table in Item 2, Properties. Encompass’ primary competition comes from locally owned private home health companies or acute care hospitals with adjunct home health services and typically varies from market to market. Providers of home health and hospice services include both not-for-profit and for-profit organizations. There are six public companies, including us, with significant presences in the home health industry, the largest of which operates long-term acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, nursing centers and assisted living facilities. The primary competitive factors in any given market include the quality of care and service provided, the treatment outcomes achieved, and the relationship and reputation with the acute care hospitals, physicians or other referral sources in the market. The ability to work as part of an integrated care delivery model with other providers is likely to become an increasingly important factor in competition. For example, Encompass is currently the exclusive preferred home health provider in an ACO serving approximately 22,000 patients. Competing companies may also offer varying home care services. Home health providers with scale, which include the other public companies, may have competitive advantages, including professional management, efficient operations, sophisticated information systems, brand recognition, and large referral bases. 
Regulatory and Reimbursement Challenges
Healthcare has always been a highly regulated industry. Currently, the industry is facing many well-publicized regulatory and reimbursement challenges. The industry is also facing uncertainty associated with the efforts, primarily arising from initiatives included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as subsequently amended, the “2010 Healthcare Reform Laws”), to identify and implement workable coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models. In January 2015, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) announced it had set various goals with respect to tying Medicare reimbursements to alternative payment models and value-based purchasing. Specifically, HHS set a goal of tying 50 percent of traditional, or fee-for-service, Medicare payments to quality or value through integrated delivery payment models, such as ACOs or bundled payment arrangements, by the end of 2018. HHS also set a goal of tying 90 percent of traditional Medicare payments to quality or value by the end of 2018 through programs such as those that include financial incentives for reducing acute care hospital readmissions. While we do not expect the drive toward integrated delivery payment models, value-based purchasing, and post-acute site neutrality in Medicare reimbursement to reverse, there remains significant uncertainty around the future of healthcare regulation in general.
The election of President Donald Trump, along with Republican majorities in the United States Senate and House of Representatives, increase the likelihood of changes to or repeal of provisions of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws through both legislative and regulatory action. On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued his first executive order titled “Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection And Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal,” that directs federal regulators to begin dismantling those laws through regulatory and policy-making processes and procedures, “to the maximum extent permitted by 
 6

law.” Any changes may ultimately affect, among other things, reimbursement of healthcare providers and consumers’ access to coverage of health services, including among non-Medicare aged population segments within commercial insurance markets and Medicaid enrollees. Changes may also affect the delivery of healthcare services to patients by providers and the regulatory compliance obligations associated with those services.

Successful healthcare providers are those who provide high-quality, cost-effective care and have the ability to adjust to changes in the regulatory and operating environments. We believe we have the necessary capabilities — scale, infrastructure, balance sheet, and management — to adapt to and succeed in a highly regulated industry, and we have a proven track record of doing so. For more in-depth discussion of the primary challenges and risks related to our business, particularly the changes in Medicare reimbursement (including the impact of announced alternative payment models and value-based purchasing initiatives), increased federal compliance and enforcement burdens, and changes to our operating environment resulting from healthcare reform, see “Regulation” below in this section as well as Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Sources of Revenues
We receive payment for patient care services from the federal government (primarily under the Medicare program), managed care plans and private insurers, and, to a considerably lesser degree, state governments (under their respective Medicaid or similar programs) and directly from patients. Revenues and receivables from Medicare are significant to our operations. In addition, we receive relatively small payments for non-patient care activities from various sources. 
We offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of healthcare services that are included in “Managed care” in the tables below, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”) and other managed care plans. Medicare, through its Medicare Advantage program, offers Medicare-eligible individuals an opportunity to participate in a managed care plan. Revenues from Medicare and Medicare Advantage represent approximately 83% of total revenues.
Patients are generally not responsible for the difference between established gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, and other private insurance plans, HMOs, or PPOs but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of these exclusions, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance has been increasing each year but is not material to our business or results of operations.
The following tables identify the sources and relative mix of our revenues for the periods stated for each of our business segments:

(1) | We began reporting for our home health and hospice segment in the first quarter of 2015 as a result of the acquisition of Encompass on December 31, 2014. For 2014, the home health and hospice business was not material to our consolidated net operating revenues.

Medicare Reimbursement
Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicare, through statutes and regulations, establishes reimbursement methodologies and rates for various types of healthcare facilities and services. Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”), an independent agency that advises Congress on issues affecting Medicare, makes payment policy recommendations to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems including, among others, the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (the “IRF-PPS”), the home health prospective payment system (“HH-PPS”) and the hospice prospective payment system (the “Hospice-PPS”). Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations, and in recent years Congress has not adopted any of the recommendations on the annual market basket update to Medicare payment rates under the IRF-PPS, which updates are discussed in greater detail below. However, MedPAC’s recommendations have, and could in the future, become the basis for subsequent legislative or regulatory action.
The Medicare statutes and regulations are subject to change from time to time. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws. With respect to Medicare reimbursement, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws provided for specific reductions to healthcare providers’ annual market basket updates, and the Medicare Access and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) Reauthorization Act of 2015 mandated a market basket update of 1.0% in 2018 for inpatient rehabilitation, home health, and hospice providers. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011 providing for an automatic 2% reduction, or “sequestration,” of Medicare program payments for all healthcare providers. Sequestration took effect April 1, 2013 and will continue through 2025 unless Congress and the President take further action. As a result of the 2016 elections, the future of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws as well as the nature and substance of any replacement reform legislation enacted remain uncertain. Additionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, or both, in 2017 and beyond.
From time to time, Medicare reimbursement methodologies and rates can be further modified by HHS’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). In some instances, these modifications can have a substantial impact on existing healthcare providers. In accordance with Medicare laws and statutes, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems, including the IRF-PPS and HH-PPS, by what is commonly known as a “market basket update.” CMS may take other regulatory action affecting rates as well. For example, under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, CMS requires IRFs to submit data on certain quality of care measures for the IRF Quality Reporting Program. A facility’s failure to submit the required quality data results in a two percentage point reduction to that facility’s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges in a subsequent Medicare fiscal year. Hospitals began submitting quality data to CMS in October 2012. All of our hospitals have met the reporting deadlines to date resulting in no corresponding reimbursement reductions for fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017. Similarly, home health and hospice agencies are also required to submit quality data to CMS each year, and the failure to do so in accordance with the rules will result in a two percentage point reduction in their market basket update. To date, only one of Encompass’ home health and hospice agencies has incurred a reduction in its reimbursement rate.

We cannot predict the adjustments to Medicare payment rates Congress or CMS may make in the future. Congress, MedPAC, and CMS will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings. Any additional downward adjustment to rates for the types of facilities we operate and services we provide could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional discussion of the risks associated with our concentration of revenues from the federal government or with potential changes to the statutes or regulations governing Medicare reimbursement, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third-party payors and regulatory changes affecting our business represent one of the most significant challenges to our business, our operations are also affected by other rules and regulations that indirectly affect reimbursement for our services, such as data coding rules and patient coverage rules and determinations. For example, on October 1, 2015, healthcare providers were required to begin using the updated and expanded diagnosis and procedure codes of the International Classification of Diseases 10th Edition (“ICD-10”) in connection with Medicare billings. We have not experienced any significant disruptions to the billing process or Medicare payments as a result of the implementation of ICD-10. 
Likewise, Medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies, either at the national or local level, that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable and necessary. For example, current CMS coverage rules require inpatient rehabilitation services to be ordered by a physician and be coordinated by an interdisciplinary team. The interdisciplinary team must meet weekly to review patient status and make any needed adjustments to the individualized plan of care. Qualified personnel must provide the rehabilitation nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, social services, psychological services, and prosthetic and orthotic services that may be needed. For individual claims, Medicare contractors make coverage determinations regarding medical necessity which can represent more restrictive interpretations of the CMS coverage rules. We cannot predict how future CMS coverage rule interpretations or any new local coverage determinations will affect us.
In the ordinary course, Medicare reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers, including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals as well as home health and hospice agencies, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) that act as fiscal intermediaries for all Medicare billings and insurance carriers, as well as the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (the “HHS-OIG”), CMS, and state Medicaid programs. In addition to those audits conducted by existing MACs, CMS has developed and instituted various Medicare audit programs under which CMS contracts with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. One type of audit contractor, the Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”), began post-payment audit processes in late 2009 for providers in general. The RACs receive claims data directly from MACs on a monthly or quarterly basis. RAC audits of IRFs initially focused on coding errors, but CMS subsequently expanded the program to include medical necessity and billing accuracy reviews.
CMS has also established contractors known as the Zone Program Integrity Contractors (“ZPICs”). These contractors are successors to the Program Safeguard Contractors and conduct audits with a focus on potential fraud and abuse issues. Like the RACs, the ZPICs conduct audits and have the ability to refer matters to the HHS-OIG or the United States Department of Justice. Unlike RACs, however, ZPICs do not receive a specific financial incentive based on the amount of the error.
As a matter of course, we undertake significant efforts through training and education to ensure compliance with coding and medical necessity coverage rules. However, despite our belief that our coding and assessment of patients are accurate, audits may lead to assertions that we have been underpaid or overpaid by Medicare or submitted improper claims in some instances, require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments and claims, and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid. We cannot predict when or how these audit programs will affect us. For additional discussion of these audits and the risks associated with them, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
A basic summary of current Medicare reimbursement in our business segments follows:
Inpatient Rehabilitation. As discussed above, our hospitals receive a fixed payment reimbursement amount per discharge under IRF-PPS based on the patient’s rehabilitation impairment category established by HHS and other characteristics and conditions identified by the attending clinicians. In order to qualify for reimbursement under IRF-PPS, our hospitals must comply with various Medicare rules and regulations including documentation and coverage requirements, or specifications as to what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement. These requirements relate to, among other things, pre-admission screening, post-admission evaluations, and individual treatment planning that all delineate the role of physicians in ordering and overseeing patient care. For example, a physician must admit each patient and in doing so determine 
 9

that the patient’s IRF treatment is reasonable and necessary. Also, each patient admitted to an IRF must be able to tolerate a minimum of three hours of therapy per day. Once in an IRF, patients must have nursing care available 24 hours, each day of the week.
Under IRF-PPS, CMS is required to adjust the payment rates based on a market basket index. Beginning in fiscal year 2016, CMS began implementing an inpatient IRF-specific market basket. The annual market basket update is designed to reflect changes over time in the prices of a mix of goods and services provided by rehabilitation hospitals and hospital-based inpatient rehabilitation units. In setting annual market basket updates, CMS uses data furnished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for price proxy purposes, primarily in three categories: Producer Price Indexes, Consumer Price Indexes, and Employment Cost Indexes. With IRF-PPS, our hospitals retain the difference, if any, between the fixed payment from Medicare and their operating costs. Thus, our hospitals benefit from being cost-effective providers.
Over the last several years, changes in regulations governing inpatient rehabilitation reimbursement have created challenges for inpatient rehabilitation providers. Many of these changes have resulted in limitations on, and in some cases, reductions in, the levels of payments to healthcare providers. For example, in 2004, CMS narrowed its rule, known as the “75% Rule,” stipulating that to qualify as an inpatient rehabilitation hospital under the Medicare program a facility must show that a certain percentage of its patients are treated for at least one of a specified and limited list of medical conditions. Under the 75% Rule, any inpatient rehabilitation hospital that failed to meet its requirements would be subject to prospective reclassification as an acute care hospital, with lower acute care payment rates for rehabilitative services. On December 29, 2007, the Medicare, Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Extension Act of 2007 (the “2007 Medicare Act”) was signed, setting the compliance threshold at 60% instead of 75% and allowing hospitals to continue using a patient’s secondary medical conditions, or “comorbidities,” to determine whether a patient qualifies for inpatient rehabilitative care under the rule. The modification of the compliance threshold in 2004 significantly reduced the total number of Medicare IRF discharges, but since setting the 60% threshold, the number of discharges has grown. In another example, the 2007 Medicare Act included an elimination of the IRF-PPS market basket adjustment for the period from April 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009 causing a reduction in the pricing of services eligible for Medicare reimbursement, or a Medicare pricing “roll-back,” which resulted in a decrease in actual reimbursement dollars per discharge despite increases in costs.
On July 31, 2015, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for the fiscal year 2016 IRF-PPS. This rule was effective for Medicare discharges between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016. The pricing changes in this rule included a 2.4% market basket update that was reduced by 0.2% to 2.2% under the requirements of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, as well as other pricing changes that impact our hospital-by-hospital base rate for Medicare reimbursement. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws also require the market basket update to be reduced by a productivity adjustment on an annual basis. The productivity adjustments equal the trailing 10-year average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity. The productivity adjustment effective October 1, 2015 decreased the market basket update by 50 basis points. Additionally, the 2016 IRF Rule required us to report six additional quality measures, the reporting of which will require additional time and expense and could affect reimbursement beginning October 1, 2017. 
On July 29, 2016, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2017 IRF-PPS (the “2017 IRF Rule”). The 2017 IRF Rule will implement a net 1.65% market basket increase effective for discharges between October 1, 2016 and September 30, 2017, calculated as follows:

Market basket update | 2.7% 
Healthcare reform reduction | 75 basis points
Productivity adjustment reduction | 30 basis points

The 2017 IRF Rule also includes other pricing changes that impact our hospital-by-hospital base rate for Medicare reimbursement. Such changes include, but are not limited to, revisions to the wage index values, changes to designations between rural and urban facilities, and updates to the outlier fixed-loss threshold. The final rule also continues the freeze to the update to the IRF-PPS facility-level rural adjustment factor, low-income patient factor, and teaching status adjustment factors. Based on our analysis which utilizes, among other things, the acuity of our patients over the 12-month period prior to the rule’s release and incorporates other adjustments included in the 2017 IRF Rule, we believe the 2017 IRF Rule will result in a net increase to our Medicare payment rates of approximately 1.9% effective October 1, 2016, prior to the impact of sequestration. Additionally, the 2017 IRF Rule requires us to report five new quality measures, the reporting of which will require additional time and expense and could affect reimbursement beginning October 1, 2017. 
Unlike our inpatient services, our outpatient services are primarily reimbursed under the physician fee schedule of Medicare Part B. Medicare reimbursement for outpatient services are subject to an annual outpatient therapy cap and a therapy cap exception process. On November 2, 2016, CMS released its final notice of rulemaking for the payment policies under the 
 10

physician fee schedule and other revisions to Part B for calendar year 2017. The provisions of this rule, including the updates to the fee schedule, are not material to us.
Home Health. Medicare pays home health benefits for patients discharged from a hospital or patients otherwise suffering from chronic conditions that require ongoing but intermittent skilled care. As a condition of participation under Medicare, patients must be homebound (meaning unable to leave their home without a considerable and taxing effort), require intermittent skilled nursing, physical therapy or speech therapy services, or have a continuing need for occupational therapy, and receive treatment under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws mandate that, prior to certifying a patient’s eligibility for the home health benefit, the certifying physician must document that he or she or a qualifying nurse practitioner has had a face-to-face encounter with the patient. Medicare pays home health providers under the HH-PPS for each 60-day period of care for each patient. Payments are adjusted based on each patient’s condition and clinical treatment. This is referred to as the case-mix adjustment. In addition to the case-mix adjustment, payments for periods of care may be adjusted for other reasons, including unusually large (outlier) costs, low-utilization patients that require four or fewer visits, and geographic differences in wages. Payments are also made for non-routine medical supplies that are used in treatment. Home health providers typically receive either 50% or 60% of the estimated base payment for the full 60 days for each patient upon submission of the initial claim. The estimate is based on the patient’s condition and treatment needs. The provider receives the remaining portion of the payment after the 60-day treatment period, subject to any applicable adjustments. If a patient remains eligible for care after that period, a new 60-day treatment period may begin. There are currently no limits to the number of home health treatment periods an eligible Medicare patient may receive.
In 2016, CMS launched a three-year pre-claim review demonstration project for home health services. The project is intended to test whether pre-claim review improves methods for the identification, investigation, and prosecution of Medicare fraud and whether the pre-claim review helps reduce expenditures while maintaining or improving quality of care. The project covers agencies in the states of Illinois, Florida, Texas, Michigan, and Massachusetts and began in Illinois on August 3, 2016. Because of difficulties encountered in administering the project, the start date in Florida has been delayed to April 1, 2017. The start dates for the other states have not been announced. For additional discussion of this project, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
On October 29, 2015, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for the calendar year 2016 HH-PPS (the “2016 HH Rule”). CMS estimated the rule would cut Medicare payments to home health agencies by 1.4% in 2016. Specifically, while the rule provided for a market basket update of 2.3%, that update was offset by a 2.4% rebasing adjustment reduction (the third year of a four-year phase-in) and a productivity adjustment reduction of 40 basis points, and a nominal case-mix coding intensity reduction of 90 basis points.
In addition, the 2016 HH Rule established a five-year Home Health Value-Based Purchasing model in nine states to test whether incentives for better care can improve outcomes in the delivery of home health services. The model, which began in 2016, applies a reduction or increase to Medicare-certified home health agency payments, depending on quality performance, made to agencies in those nine states. Performance will be assessed based on several process, outcome, and care satisfaction measures. We cannot predict what, if any, impact this model will have on our Medicare reimbursements. For additional discussion of this model, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
On October 31, 2016, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for calendar year 2017 for home health agencies under the HH-PPS (the “2017 HH Rule”). Specifically, while the rule provides for a market basket update of 2.8%, that update is offset by a 2.3% rebasing adjustment reduction (the final year of a four-year phase-in), a productivity adjustment reduction of 30 basis points, and a nominal case-mix coding intensity reduction of 90 basis points. The 2017 HH Rule also includes other pricing changes, such as a reduction to the case-mix weights for certain cases and a change in the outlier payment calculation, that impact our Medicare reimbursement. Based on our analysis, we believe the 2017 HH Rule will result in a net decrease to our Medicare home health payment rates of approximately 3.6% effective for episodes ending in calendar year 2017, prior to the impact of sequestration. Additionally, the 2017 HH Rule requires us to report four new quality measures, the reporting of which will require additional time and expense and could affect reimbursement beginning in 2018. 
Hospice. Medicare pays hospice benefits for patients with life expectancies of six months or less, as documented by the patient’s physician(s). Under Medicare rules, patients seeking hospice benefits must agree to forgo curative treatment for their terminal medical conditions. For each day a patient elects hospice benefits, Medicare pays an adjusted daily rate based on patient location, and payments represent a prospective per diem amount tied to one of four different categories or levels of care: routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite care, and general inpatient care. Medicare hospice reimbursements to each provider are also subject to two annual caps, one limiting total hospice payments based on the average annual payment 
 11

per beneficiary and another limiting payments based on the number of days of inpatient care billed by the hospice provider. There are currently no limits to the number of hospice benefit periods an eligible Medicare patient may receive, and a patient may revoke the benefit at any time.
On July 29, 2016, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2017 for hospice agencies under the hospice-PPS (the “2017 Hospice Rule”). The final rule would impact hospice payments between October 1, 2016 and September 30, 2017. Specifically, the rule provides for a net market basket update of 2.1% after reductions required by the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws and the annual productivity adjustment, and we believe that update is indicative of the change we will see in our Medicare hospice payment rates effective October 1, 2016. However, the provisions of the 2017 Hospice Rule were not material to us.
For additional discussion of matters and risks related to reimbursement, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Managed Care and Other Discount Plans
We offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of healthcare services, including Medicare Advantage, managed care plans, private insurance companies, and third-party administrators. Managed care contracts typically have terms between one and three years, although we have a number of managed care contracts that automatically renew each year (with pre-defined rate increases) unless a party elects to terminate the contract. In 2016, typical rate increases for our inpatient rehabilitation contracts ranged from 2-4% and for our home health and hospice contracts ranged from 0-2%. We cannot provide any assurance we will continue to receive increases in the future. Our managed care staff focuses on establishing and re-negotiating contracts that provide equitable reimbursement for the services provided. 
Medicaid Reimbursement
Medicaid is a jointly administered and funded federal and state program that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are deemed unable to afford healthcare. As the Medicaid program is administered by the individual states under the oversight of CMS in accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines, there are substantial differences in reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state to state. Many states have experienced shortfalls in their Medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts in Medicaid reimbursement rates. Additionally, certain states control Medicaid expenditures through restricting or eliminating coverage of certain services. Continuing downward pressure on Medicaid payment rates could cause a decline in that portion of our Net operating revenues. However, for the year ended December 31, 2016, Medicaid payments represented only 3.2% of our consolidated Net operating revenues. In certain states in which we operate, we are experiencing an increase in Medicaid patients, likely the result of expanded coverage consistent with the intent of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws. Changes to these laws and regulations implemented by Congress, the Trump Administration, or both, could impact expanded Medicaid coverage, including the number of Medicaid patients with access to our services. For additional discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Changes in our payor mix or the acuity of our patients could adversely impact our revenues or our profitability.”
Cost Reports
Because of our participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and certain Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, we are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue, costs, and expenses associated with the services provided by inpatient hospital, home health, and hospice providers to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. These annual cost reports are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits are used for determining if any under- or over-payments were made to these programs and to set payment levels for future years. Medicare also makes retroactive adjustments to payments for certain low-income patients after comparing subsequently published statistical data from CMS to the cost report data. We cannot predict what retroactive adjustments, if any, will be made, but we do not anticipate such adjustments would have a material impact on us.
Regulation
The healthcare industry is subject to significant federal, state, and local regulation that affects our business activities by controlling the reimbursement we receive for services provided, requiring licensure or certification of our operations, regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources, regulating the use of our properties, and controlling our growth. We are also subject to the broader federal and state regulations that prohibit fraud and abuse in the delivery of healthcare services. As a healthcare provider, we are subject to periodic audits, examinations and investigations conducted by, or at the direction of, government investigative and oversight agencies. Violations of the applicable federal and state healthcare 
 12

regulations can result in a provider’s exclusion from participation in government reimbursement programs and in substantial civil and criminal penalties.
We undertake significant effort and expense to provide the medical, nursing, therapy, and ancillary services required to comply with local, state, and federal regulations, as well as, for most facilities, accreditation standards of The Joint Commission (formerly known as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) and, for some facilities, the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities.
We maintain a comprehensive compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed all laws and regulations and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the compliance program, we provide annual compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor or through a toll-free telephone hotline.
Licensure and Certification
Healthcare facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state, and local regulations relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, infection control, maintenance of adequate records and patient privacy, fire prevention, and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Our hospitals are subject to periodic inspection and other reviews by governmental and non-governmental certification authorities to ensure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for facility licensure. All of our inpatient hospitals are currently required to be licensed.
In addition, hospitals must be certified by CMS to participate in the Medicare program and generally must be certified by Medicaid state agencies to participate in Medicaid programs. Certification and participation in these programs involve numerous regulatory obligations. For example, hospitals must treat at least 30 patients free-of-charge prior to certification and eligibility for Medicare reimbursement. Once certified by Medicare, hospitals undergo periodic on-site surveys and revalidations in order to maintain their certification. All of our inpatient hospitals participate in the Medicare program.
Encompass agencies are each licensed under applicable law, certified by CMS for participation in the Medicare program, and generally certified by the applicable state Medicaid agencies to participate in those programs.
Failure to comply with applicable certification requirements may make our hospitals and agencies, as the case may be, ineligible for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. In addition, Medicare or Medicaid may seek retroactive reimbursement from noncompliant providers or otherwise impose sanctions for noncompliance. Non-governmental payors often have the right to terminate provider contracts if the provider loses its Medicare or Medicaid certification.
The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws added new screening requirements and associated fees for all Medicare providers. The screening must include a licensure check and may include other procedures such as fingerprinting, criminal background checks, unscheduled and unannounced site visits, database checks, and other screening procedures prescribed by CMS.
We have developed operational systems to oversee compliance with the various standards and requirements of the Medicare program and have established ongoing quality assurance activities; however, given the complex nature of governmental healthcare regulations, there can be no assurance Medicare, Medicaid, or other regulatory authorities will not allege instances of noncompliance. A determination by a regulatory authority that a facility is not in compliance with applicable requirements could also lead to the assessment of fines or other penalties, loss of licensure, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, and the imposition of requirements that an offending facility takes corrective action.
Certificates of Need
In some states and U.S. territories where we operate, the construction or expansion of facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities or agencies, or the introduction of new beds or inpatient, home health, and hospice services may be subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory bodies under a “certificate of need,” or “CON,” law. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 51% of our licensed beds and 20% of our home health and hospice locations are located in states or U.S. territories that have CON laws. CON laws often require a reviewing agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities and services. These laws also generally require approvals for capital expenditures involving inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, if such capital expenditures exceed certain thresholds. In addition, CON laws in some states require us to abide by certain charity care commitments as a condition for approving a CON. Any time a CON is required, we 
 13

must obtain it before acquiring, opening, reclassifying, or expanding a healthcare facility, starting a new healthcare program, or opening a new home health or hospice agency.
We potentially face opposition any time we initiate a CON project or seek to acquire an existing facility, agency, or CON. This opposition may arise either from competing national or regional companies or from local hospitals, agencies, or other providers which file competing applications or oppose the proposed CON project. Opposition to our applications may delay or prevent our future addition of beds, hospitals, or agencies in given markets or increase our costs in seeking those additions. The necessity for these approvals serves as a barrier to entry and has the potential to limit competition, including in markets where we hold a CON and a competitor is seeking an approval. We have generally been successful in obtaining CONs or similar approvals when required, although there can be no assurance we will achieve similar success in the future, and the likelihood of success varies by locality and state.
False Claims
The federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) prohibits the knowing presentation of a false claim to the United States government and provides for penalties equal to three times the actual amount of any overpayments plus up to approximately $22,000 per claim. Beginning no later than August 1, 2016, federal civil penalties will be adjusted to account for inflation each year. In addition, the FCA allows private persons, known as “relators,” to file complaints under seal and provides a period of time for the government to investigate such complaints and determine whether to intervene in them and take over the handling of all or part of such complaints. The government and relators may also allege violations of the FCA for the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following identification of an overpayment. This is known as a “reverse false claim.” The government deems identification of the overpayment to occur when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment.
Because we perform thousands of similar procedures a year for which we are reimbursed by Medicare and other federal payors and there is a relatively long statute of limitations, a billing error, cost reporting error or disagreement over physician medical judgment could result in significant civil or criminal penalties under the FCA. Many states have also adopted similar laws relating to state government payments for healthcare services. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws amended the FCA to expand the definition of false claim, to make it easier for the government to initiate and conduct investigations, to enhance the monetary reward to relators where prosecutions are ultimately successful, and to extend the statute of limitations on claims by the government. The federal government has become increasingly aggressive in asserting that incidents of erroneous billing or record keeping represent FCA violations and challenging the medical judgment of independent physicians as the basis for FCA allegations. Furthermore, well-publicized enforcement actions indicate that the federal government has increasingly sought to use statistical sampling to extrapolate allegations to larger pools of claims or to infer liability without proving knowledge of fraud. For additional discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Note 17, Contingencies and Other Commitments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Relationships with Physicians and Other Providers
Anti-Kickback Law. Various state and federal laws regulate relationships between providers of healthcare services, including management or service contracts and investment relationships. Among the most important of these restrictions is a federal law prohibiting the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of remuneration by individuals or entities to induce referrals of patients for services reimbursed under the Medicare or Medicaid programs (the “Anti-Kickback Law”). The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws amended the federal Anti-Kickback Law to provide that proving violations of this law does not require proving actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation. Another amendment made it clear that Anti-Kickback Law violations can be the basis for claims under the FCA. These changes and those described above related to the FCA, when combined with other recent federal initiatives, are likely to increase investigation and enforcement efforts in the healthcare industry generally. In addition to standard federal criminal and civil sanctions, including imprisonment and penalties of up to $50,000 for each violation plus tripled damages for improper claims, violators of the Anti-Kickback Law may be subject to exclusion from the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. In 1991, the HHS-OIG issued regulations describing compensation arrangements that are not viewed as illegal remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Law. Those regulations provide for certain safe harbors for identified types of compensation arrangements that, if fully complied with, assure participants in the particular arrangement that the HHS-OIG will not treat that participation as a criminal offense under the Anti-Kickback Law or as the basis for an exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or the imposition of civil sanctions. Failure to fall within a safe harbor does not constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law, but the HHS-OIG has indicated failure to fall within a safe harbor may subject an arrangement to increased scrutiny. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Law by us or one or more of our joint ventures could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation.
 14

Some of our rehabilitation hospitals are owned through joint ventures with institutional healthcare providers that may be in a position to make or influence referrals to our hospitals. In addition, we have a number of relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, including management or service contracts. Some of these investment relationships and contractual relationships may not fall within the protection offered by a safe harbor. Despite our compliance and monitoring efforts, there can be no assurance violations of the Anti-Kickback Law will not be asserted in the future, nor can there be any assurance our defense against any such assertion would be successful.
For example, we have entered into agreements to manage our hospitals that are owned by joint ventures. Most of these agreements incorporate a percentage-based management fee. Although there is a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts, this safe harbor requires, among other things, the aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement be set in advance. Because our management fee may be based on a percentage of revenues, the fee arrangement may not meet this requirement. However, we believe our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements of the safe harbor for personal services and management contracts and comply with the Anti-Kickback Law.
Physician Self-Referral Law. The federal law commonly known as the “Stark law” and CMS regulations promulgated under the Stark law prohibit physicians from making referrals for “designated health services” including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, radiology services, and home health services, to an entity in which the physician (or an immediate family member) has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to certain exceptions. The Stark law also prohibits those entities from filing claims or billing Medicare for those referred services. Violators of the Stark law and regulations may be subject to recoupments, civil monetary sanctions (up to $15,000 for each violation and assessments up to three times the amount claimed for each prohibited service) and exclusion from any federal, state, or other governmental healthcare programs. The statute also provides a penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme. There are statutory exceptions to the Stark law for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including personal services contracts and leases. However, in order to be afforded protection by a Stark law exception, the financial arrangement must comply with every requirement of the applicable exception.
Under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, the exception to the Stark law that currently permits physicians to refer patients to hospitals in which they have an investment or ownership interest has been dramatically limited by providing that only physician-owned hospitals with a provider agreement in place on December 31, 2010 are exempt from the general ban on self-referral. Existing physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the physician ownership percentage in the hospital after March 23, 2010. Additionally, physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the number of licensed beds after March 23, 2010, except when certain market and regulatory approval conditions are met. Currently, we have no hospitals that would be considered physician-owned under this law, except for one hospital acquired in 2015 which has an outside limited partner with a 0.5% equity interest.
CMS has issued several phases of final regulations implementing the Stark law. On November 16, 2015, CMS issued a new rule revising, clarifying, and adding two exceptions in order to accommodate delivery and payment system reform, reduce burdens on physicians and other providers, and promote compliance. While the changes are generally expected to help providers comply with the Stark law requirements, the complexity of the law and the associated regulations will remain a challenge for healthcare providers, who do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet one or more exceptions to the Stark law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex. Accordingly, we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark law.
Additionally, no assurances can be given that any agency charged with enforcement of the Stark law and regulations might not assert a violation under the Stark law, nor can there be any assurance our defense against any such assertion would be successful or that new federal or state laws governing physician relationships, or new interpretations of existing laws governing such relationships, might not adversely affect relationships we have established with physicians or result in the imposition of penalties on us or on particular HealthSouth hospitals or another of our providers. A violation of the Stark law by us could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation.
HIPAA
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly known as “HIPAA,” broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. HIPAA also added a prohibition against incentives intended to influence decisions by Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive services. In addition, HIPAA created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse, including the Medicare Integrity Program, and an incentive program under which individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at 
 15

least $100 of Medicare funds. Penalties for violations of HIPAA include civil and criminal monetary penalties. The HHS Office of Civil Rights (“HHS-OCR”) implemented a permanent HIPAA audit program for healthcare providers nationwide in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we have not been selected for audit.
HIPAA and related HHS regulations contain certain administrative simplification provisions that require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. HIPAA regulations also regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health-related information, whether communicated electronically, on paper, or orally. The regulations provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed and require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical, and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically.
With the enactment of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the privacy and security requirements of HIPAA have been modified and expanded. The HITECH Act applies certain of the HIPAA privacy and security requirements directly to business associates of covered entities. The modifications to existing HIPAA requirements include: expanded accounting requirements for electronic health records, tighter restrictions on marketing and fundraising, and heightened penalties and enforcement associated with noncompliance. Significantly, the HITECH Act also establishes new mandatory federal requirements for notification of breaches of security involving protected health information. HHS-OCR is responsible for enforcing the requirement that covered entities notify any individual whose protected health information has been improperly acquired, accessed, used, or disclosed. In certain cases, notice of a breach is required to be made to HHS and media outlets. The heightened penalties for noncompliance range from $100 to $50,000 per violation for most violations. In the event of violations due to willful neglect that are not corrected within 30 days, penalties start at $50,000 per violation and are not subject to a per violation statutory maximum. All penalties are subject to a $1,500,000 cap for multiple identical violations in a single calendar year. Willful neglect could include the failure to conduct a security risk assessment or adequately implement HIPAA compliance policies.
On January 17, 2013, the HHS-OCR issued a final rule, with a compliance date of September 23, 2013, to implement the HITECH Act and make other modifications to the HIPAA and HITECH regulations. This rule expanded the potential liability for a breach involving protected health information to cover some instances where a subcontractor is responsible for the breaches and that individual or entity was acting within the scope of delegated authority under the related contract or engagement. The final rule generally defines “breach” to mean the acquisition, access, use or disclosure of protected health information in a manner not permitted by the HIPAA privacy standards, which compromises the security or privacy of protected health information. Under the final rule, improper acquisition, access, use, or disclosure is presumed to be a reportable breach, unless the potentially breaching party can demonstrate a low probability that protected health information has been compromised. 
In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy concerns. Healthcare providers will continue to remain subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. HHS-OIG and other regulators have also increasingly interpreted laws and regulations in a manner as to increase exposure of healthcare providers to allegations of noncompliance. Any actual or perceived violation of privacy-related laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
