(“Jerash Holdings”), through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries and variable interest entity (“VIE”) (together the “Group,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), is principally engaged in the manufacturing and exporting of customized, ready-made sport and outerwear from knitted fabric and personal protective equipment (“PPE”) produced in its facilities in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (“Jordan”). Our website address is http://www.jerashholdings.com. Information available on our website is not a part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We are a manufacturer for many well-known brands and retailers, such as Walmart, Costco, New Balance, G-III (which owns brands such as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, DKNY, and Guess), American Eagle, and VF Corporation (which owns brands such as The North Face, Timberland, and JanSport). Our production facilities comprise four factory units, one workshop, and four warehouses and we currently employ approximately 4,300 people. The total annual capacity at our facilities is approximately 12.0 million pieces (average for product categories including t-shirts, polo shirts, pants, shorts, and jackets, and excluding PPE).
 
Organizational Structure
 
Jerash Holdings is a holding company organized in Delaware in January 2016. As of the date of this annual report, Jerash Holdings has the following wholly owned subsidiaries: (i) Jerash Garments and Fashions Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (“Jerash Garments”), an entity formed under the laws of Jordan, (ii) Treasure Success International Limited (“Treasure Success”), an entity formed under the laws of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Hong Kong” or “HK”), (iii) Chinese Garments and Fashions Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (“Chinese Garments”), an entity formed under the laws of Jordan and a wholly owned subsidiary of Jerash Garments, (iv) Jerash for Industrial Embroidery Co., Ltd. (“Jerash Embroidery”), an entity formed under the laws of Jordan and a wholly owned subsidiary of Jerash Garments, (v) Al-Mutafaweq Co. for Garments Manufacturing Ltd. (“Paramount”), an entity formed under the laws of Jordan and a wholly owned subsidiary of Jerash Garments, (vi) Jiangmen Treasure Success Business Consultancy Co., Ltd. (“Jiangmen Treasure Success”), an entity incorporated under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“China” or the “PRC”) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Treasure Success, (vii) Jerash The First Medical Supplies Manufacturing Company Limited (“Jerash The First”), an entity formed under the laws of Jordan and a wholly owned subsidiary of Jerash Garments, and (viii) Jerash Supplies, LLC (“Jerash Supplies”), an entity formed under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
In addition, Jerash Garments has a VIE, Victory Apparel (Jordan) Manufacturing Company Limited (“Victory Apparel”), a limited liability company formed under the laws of Jordan. Although Jerash Garments does not own the equity interests of Victory Apparel, Mr. Choi Lin Hung (“Mr. Choi”), our chairman, chief executive officer, president, treasurer, and a significant stockholder, is also a director of Victory Apparel and controls all decision-making for Victory Apparel along with our other significant stockholder, Mr. Lee Kian Tjiauw, who has the ability to control Victory Apparel’s financial affairs. In addition, Victory Apparel’s equity at risk is not sufficient to permit it to operate without additional subordinated financial support from Mr. Choi. Based on these facts, we concluded that Jerash Garments has effective control over Victory Apparel due to Mr. Choi’s roles at both organizations and therefore Victory Apparel is considered a VIE under Accounting Standards Codification 810-10-05-08A. Accordingly, Jerash Garments consolidates Victory Apparel’s operating results, assets, and liabilities.

Products 
 
As a garment manufacturing group, we specialize in manufacturing sport and outerwear. Our sport and outerwear product offering consists of jackets, polo shirts, t-shirts, pants, and shorts. Our primary product offering is jackets, and in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 25% and 50%, respectively, of our total shipped pieces were jackets.
 
In response to high demand for PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we started manufacturing PPE in 2020. Our PPE product offering consists of branded (washable) and disposable face masks, medical scrubs, protective coveralls, and surgical gowns. In order to advance our PPE market development efforts, we incorporated a new entity, Jerash The First, which received temporary permission from Jordan’s Food and Drug Administration to manufacture and export non-surgical PPE. Our production facility for PPE needs to meet certain structural requirements before we can receive a permanent permission and we are still planning the production facility. In September, 2020, we successfully registered as a medical device manufacturing facility with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the sale and export of our PPE products to the United States. We also received an ISO 13485 designation covering the manufacturing, packing, and selling of medical supplies. PPE contributed 1% of our total revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.
 
Manufacturing and Production
 
Our production facilities are located in Al Tajamouat Industrial City and in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan.
 
Our production facilities in Al Tajamouat Industrial City comprise four factory units and four warehouses. Effective as of January 1, 2019, the government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan converted Al Tajamouat Industrial City into a Development Zone. Following this change, we continued to operate under benefits similar to the Qualifying Industrial Zone designation, but were subject to 10% corporation income tax plus a 1% social contribution. On January 1, 2020, the corporation income tax increased to 14%. Effective on January 1, 2021, we have been subject to 16% corporate income tax plus a 1% social contribution. Currently, the first factory unit, which we own, employs approximately 1,500 people. Its primary functions are to house our management offices, as well as production lines, trims warehouse, and printing, sewing, ironing, and packaging units. The second factory unit, which we lease, employs approximately 1,300 people. Its primary functions are to house our administrative and human resources personnel, merchandising and accounting departments, embroidery, printing, additional production lines, trims and finished products warehouses, and sewing, ironing, packing and quality control units. The third factory unit, which we lease, employs approximately 200 people. Its primary functions are to perform the cutting for our products. The fourth factory unit (under Paramount), which we lease, currently employs approximately 1,000 people. Its primary functions are to house additional production lines.
 
Our production facility in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan comprises a workshop. The workshop currently employs approximately 300 people and its primary functions are to manufacture garment products per customer orders. We commenced the construction of this workshop in 2018, and it was completed and started operation in November 2019. This is a joint project with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor and the Jordanian Education and Training Department. According to our agreement with these government agencies, we will be using this workshop without paying rent until December 2022, after which we anticipate entering into a lease agreement for the workshop with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor for market rent. Provided that we satisfy certain employment requirements over certain time periods, we do not anticipate incurring any significant costs for this project. In the event we breach our agreement with these government agencies, we will have to pay such agencies 250,000 Jordanian Dinar (“JOD”) or approximately $353,000. See “Item 2. Properties” below for more information regarding this workshop.
 
In 2015, we commenced a project to build a 4,800 square foot workshop in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which was previously intended to be used as a sewing workshop for Jerash Garments, but which we now intend to use as a dormitory. Construction has been temporarily suspended since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This dormitory is expected to be operational in fiscal 2022 to house management and supervisory staff for our production facility in Al-Hasa County. This project is expected to cost approximately $200,000 upon completion.

In April 2021, we commenced a construction on a 189,000 square-foot housing facility for our multi-national workforce, situated on a 49,000 square-foot site owned by us, in Al Tajamouat Industrial City. We anticipate the completion and occupancy of the new building by mid-2022. To meet increasing demand, we are also completing plans to construct an additional project on a nearby separate 133,000 square-foot parcel that we purchased in 2019 for $1.2 million, with 2/3 of the land allocated for our fifth manufacturing plant and 1/3 for housing. We anticipate starting the construction later this year.
 
Total annual capacity at our existing facilities is approximately 12.0 million pieces (average for product categories including t-shirts, polo shirts, pants, shorts, and jackets, and excluding PPE). Our production flow begins in the cutting department of our factory unit. Then the product is sent to the embroidery department for embroidery if applicable. From there, the product moves to be processed by the sewing unit, finishing department, quality control, and finally the ironing and packing units.
 
We do not have long term supply contracts or arrangements with our suppliers. Most of our ultimate suppliers for raw materials, such as fabric, zippers, and labels, are designated by customers and we purchase such materials on a purchase order basis.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of approximately 4,350 employees located in Jordan, Hong Kong, the People’s Republic of China, and the United States of America, all of which are full-time employees.

(1) | Most of our products are sold under The North Face brand which is owned by VF Corporation.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, we depended on a few key customers for our sales, and most of our sales in fiscal 2021 and 2020 were to one customer, VF Corporation.
 
We started producing garments for VF Corporation in 2012. Most of the products we manufacture are sold under The North Face Brand which is owned by VF Corporation. Currently, we manufacture primarily outerwear for The North Face. Approximately 62% and 77% of our sales in fiscal 2021 and 2020 were derived from the sale of manufactured products to VF Corporation, respectively. We are not party to any long-term contracts with VF Corporation or our other customers, and our sales arrangements with our customers do not have minimum purchase requirements. As is common in our industry, VF Corporation and our other customers place purchase orders with us after we complete detailed sample development and approval processes that we and our customers have agreed upon for their purchase of the relevant manufactured garments. It is through the sample development and approval processes that we and VF Corporation and our other customers agree on the purchase and manufacture of the garments. For fiscal 2021, VF Corporate issued approximately 5,400 purchase orders to us in amounts ranging from approximately $8 to $596,000. For fiscal 2020, VF Corporation issued approximately 7,400 purchase orders to us in amounts ranging from approximately $7 to $380,000.

Our customers are in the retail industry, which is subject to substantial cyclical variations. Consequently, there can be no assurance that sales to current customers will continue at the current rate or at all. In addition, our annual and quarterly results may vary, which may cause our profits and the market price of our common stock to decline.
 
We continue to seek to expand and strengthen our relationship with our current customers and other brand names. However, we cannot assure you that these brands will continue to buy our products in the same volumes or on the same terms as they did in the past or that we will be successful in expanding our relationship with other brand names.
 
Competition
 
The markets for the manufacturing of sport and outerwear are highly competitive. The competition in those markets is focused primarily on the price and quality of the product and the level of customer service. Our products compete with products of other apparel manufacturers in Asia, Israel, Europe, the United States, and South and Central America.
 
Competition with other manufacturers in the clothing industry focuses on reducing production costs, reducing supply lead time, design, product quality, and efficiency of supply to the customer. Since production costs depend to a large extent on labor costs, in recent years most production in the industry has been moved to countries where labor costs are low. Some of our competitors have lower cost bases, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and other advantages over us which allow them to compete with us. As described in more detail under “—Conditions in Jordan” below, we are able to sell our products manufactured at our facilities in Jordan to the United States free from customs duties and import quotas under certain conditions. These favorable terms enable us to remain competitive on the basis of price. According to the Association Agreement between the European Union (the “EU”) and Jordan, which came into force in May 2002, and the joint initiative on rules of origin reviewed and improved in December 2018 by the EU and Jordan, goods manufactured by us in Jordan that are subsequently shipped to EU countries are shipped free from customs duties.
 
Conditions in Jordan
 
Our manufacturing facilities are located in Jordan. Accordingly, we are directly affected by political, security, and economic conditions in Jordan.
 
From time to time Jordan has experienced instances of civil unrest, terrorism, and hostilities among neighboring countries, including Syria and Israel. A peace agreement between Israel and Jordan was signed in 1994. Terrorist attacks, military activity, rioting, or civil or political unrest in the future could influence the Jordanian economy and our operations by disrupting operations and communications and making travel within Jordan more difficult and less desirable. Political or social tensions also could create a greater perception that investments in companies with Jordanian operations involve a high degree of risk, which could adversely affect the market and price for our common stock.
 
Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, but the King holds wide executive and legislative powers. The ruling family has taken initiatives that support the economic growth of the country. However, there is no assurance that such initiatives will be successful or will continue. The rate of economic liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies affecting manufacturing companies, foreign investments, currency exchange rates, and other matters affecting investments in Jordan could change as well.
 
In December 2019, “COVID-19” was first identified in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic—the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. On March 17, 2020, Jordan announced a shutdown of non-essential activities as part of its proactive national efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and we suspended the operations of our facilities in Jordan as a result on March 18, 2020. On March 26, 2020, the International Monetary Fund announced that its executive board approved a 48-month arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility with Jordan for an amount of approximately $1.3 billion to support the country’s economic and financial reform program. The arrangement also provided for spending to contain and treat COVID-19. On April 28, 2020, the World Bank approved a $20 million project to help Jordan face the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 4, 2020, we resumed operations of our main production facilities in Al Tajamount Industrial City under the condition that only migrant workers, living in dormitories in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, are allowed to go to work in our factories under strict hygienic precautionary measures pursuant to an approval from the Jordanian Government dated April 1, 2020. Our Al-Hasa workshop was also allowed to restart operation on April 26, 2020. Eventually, local employees were allowed to resume work on June 1, 2020.

Trade Agreements
 
Because of the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, which came into force on December 17, 2001, and was implemented fully on January 1, 2010, and the Association Agreement between the EU and Jordan, which came into force in May 2002, we are able to sell our products manufactured at our facilities in Jordan to the U.S. free from customs duties and import quotas under certain conditions and to EU countries free from customs duties.
Income Tax Incentives
 
Effective January 1, 2019, Jordan’s government converted the geographical area where Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries and VIE are located from a Free Zone to a Development Zone. Development Zones are industrial parks that house manufacturing operations in Jordan. In accordance with Development Zone law, Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries and VIE began paying corporate income tax in Jordan at a rate of 10% plus 1% social contribution. Effective January 1, 2020, this rate increased to 14% plus 1% social contribution, and effective January 1, 2021, this rate further increased to 16% plus 1% social contribution. For more information, see “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Income Taxes.”
 
In addition, Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries and VIE are subject to local sales tax of 16%. However, Jerash Garments was granted a sales tax exemption from the Jordanian Investment Commission for the period June 1, 2015 to June 1, 2018 that allowed Jerash Garments to make purchases with no sales tax charge. This exemption was extended to February 5, 2022.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our manufacturing and other facilities in Jordan are subject to various local regulations relating to the maintenance of safe working conditions and manufacturing practices. Management believes that it is currently in compliance in all material respects with all such regulations. We are not subject to governmental approval of our products or manufacturing process.
