Item 1.     Business.
 
Air T, Inc. (the “Company,” “Air T,” “we” or “us”) is a decentralized holding company with ownership interests in a broad set of operating and financial assets that are designed to expand, strengthen and diversify our cash earnings power. Our goal is to build on Air T’s core businesses, to expand into adjacent industries, and when appropriate, to acquire companies that we believe fit into the Air T family. 
 
We currently operate wholly owned subsidiaries in three legacy industry segments:
 

• | overnight air cargo, comprised of our Mountain Air Cargo, Inc. (“MAC”) and CSA Air, Inc. (“CSA”) subsidiaries, which operates in the air express delivery services industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ground equipment sales, comprised of our Global Ground Support, LLC (“GGS”) subsidiary, which manufactures and provides mobile deicers and other specialized equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines, airports, the military and industrial customers; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ground support services, comprised of our Global Aviation Services, LLC (“GAS”) subsidiary, which provides ground support equipment maintenance and facilities maintenance services to domestic airlines and aviation service providers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the past two years, we have organized or acquired businesses operating in three other segments. In October 2015, we formed a wholly owned equipment leasing subsidiary, Air T Global Leasing, LLC (“ATGL”), which comprises our leasing segment.  In November 2015, we acquired debt and equity interests in Delphax Technologies, Inc. (“Delphax”), a printing equipment manufacturer and maintenance provider, which comprises our printing equipment and maintenance segment.  In July 2016, our majority owned subsidiary, Contrail Aviation Support, LLC (“Contrail Aviation”), acquired the principal assets of a business based in Verona, Wisconsin engaged in acquiring surplus commercial jet engines and components and supplying surplus and aftermarket commercial jet engine components.  In October 2016, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Jet Yard, LLC (“Jet Yard”) to provide commercial aircraft storage, maintenance and aircraft disassembly/part-out services at facilities leased at the Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona.  In May 2017, our newly formed subsidiaries, AirCo, LLC and AirCo Services, LLC (collectively, “AirCo”), acquired the inventory and principal assets of a business based in Wichita, Kansas that distributes and sells airplane and aviation parts. Contrail Aviation, Jet Yard and AirCo comprise the commercial jet engines and parts segment of the Company’s operations.  This segment, formerly referred to as the commercial jet engines segment, was renamed to reflect its broader product and service offerings.
 
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, the overnight air cargo segment accounted for 47% of our consolidated revenues, the ground equipment sales segment accounted for 21% of our consolidated revenues, the ground support services segment accounted for 21% of consolidated revenues, while the printing equipment and maintenance segment, the commercial jet engines and parts segment, and the leasing segment accounted for 6%, 5% and less than 1%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Certain financial data with respect to the Company’s segments and geographic areas is set forth in Notes 20 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
 
Air T was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1980. The principal place of business of Air T, MAC and ATGL is 5930 Balsom Ridge Road, Denver, North Carolina, the principal place of business of CSA is Iron Mountain, Michigan, the principal place of business for GGS is Olathe, Kansas, the principal place of business for GAS is Eagan, Minnesota, the principal place of business of Delphax is Minneapolis, Minnesota, the principal place of business of Contrail Aviation is Verona, Wisconsin, the principal place of business of AirCo is Wichita, Kansas, and the principal place of business of Jet Yard is Marana, Arizona.  We maintain an Internet website at http://www.airt.net and our SEC filings may be accessed through links on our website.

Acquisitions.
 
Delphax. On November 24, 2015, the Company purchased (i) at face value a $2,500,000 principal amount Five-Year Senior Subordinated Promissory Note (the “Senior Subordinated Note”) issued by Delphax’s Canadian operating subsidiary, Delphax Technologies Canada Limited (“Delphax Canada”), for a combination of cash and the surrender of outstanding principal of $500,000 and accrued and unpaid interest thereunder, and cancellation of, a 90-Day Senior Subordinated Note purchased at face value by the Company from that Delphax subsidiary on October 2, 2015 and (ii) for $1,050,000 in cash a total of 43,000 shares (the “Shares”) of Delphax’s Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and a Stock Purchase Warrant (the “Warrant”) to acquire an additional 95,600 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a price of $33.4728 per share (subject to adjustment for specified dilutive events). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into 100 shares of common stock of Delphax, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. Based on the number of shares of Delphax common stock outstanding and reserved for issuance under Delphax’s employee stock option plans, at March 31, 2017 and 2016 the number of shares of common stock underlying the Shares represent approximately 38% of the shares of Delphax common stock that would be outstanding assuming conversion of the Shares and approximately 31% of the outstanding shares assuming conversion of the Shares and the issuance of all the shares of Delphax common stock reserved for issuance under Delphax’s employee stock option plans. Under the agreement that provided for the Company’s purchase of these interests, on November 24, 2015 three designees of the Company (including Nick Swenson, the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Michael Moore, the President of our GGS subsidiary) were elected to the board of directors of Delphax, which had a total of seven members following their election. Pursuant to the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, for so long as amounts are owed to Air T under the Senior Subordinated Note or we continue to hold a specified number of the Shares and interests in the Warrant holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, the Company would be entitled to elect, after June 1, 2016, four-sevenths of the members of the board of directors of Delphax and, without the written consent or waiver of the Company, Delphax may not enter into specified corporate transactions. As a result of these transactions, we determined that we had obtained control over Delphax in conjunction with the acquisition of the interests described above, and we have consolidated the relevant financial information of Delphax in Air T’s consolidated financial statements beginning on November 24, 2015. 
On January 6, 2017, the Company acquired all rights, and assumed all obligations, of a third-party lender under a senior credit agreement (the “Delphax Senior Credit Agreement”) with Delphax and Delphax Canada providing for a $7.0 million revolving senior secured credit facility, subject to a borrowing base of North American accounts receivable and inventory, including obligations, if any, to fund future borrowings under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement. In connection with this transaction, the Company paid to such third-party senior lender an amount equal to the approximately $1.26 million outstanding borrowing balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest and fees. Also in connection with this transaction, the Company, Delphax and Delphax Canada entered into an amendment to the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement to reduce the maximum amount of borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement from $7.0 million to $2.5 million, to revise the borrowing base to include in the borrowing base 100% of purchase orders from customers for products up to $500,000, to provide that the interest rate on all borrowings outstanding until all loans under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement are repaid in full will be a default rate equal to 2.5% per month to be paid monthly, and to provide for the payment to the Company from Delphax Canada and Delphax of fees equal to $25,000 upon execution of the amendment and of $50,000 upon repayment in full of all loans under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement. On January 6, 2017, the Company notified Delphax and Delphax Canada of certain “Events of Default” (as defined under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement) existing under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement and that the Company was reserving all rights to exercise remedies under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement and that no delay in exercising any such remedy is to be construed as a waiver of any of its remedies. Also, on January 6, 2017, the Company and Delphax Canada entered into a Forbearance and Amendment Agreement dated as of January 6, 2017, which amended the Senior Subordinated Note to increase the default rate of interest from an annual rate of 10.5% to an annual rate of 18%, to be in effect until all amounts under the Senior Subordinated Note are paid in full, and which provides that so long as no Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Subordinated Note) occurs under the Senior Subordinated Note, other than Events of Default that existed as of January 6, 2017, the Company agreed to forbear from exercising its remedies under the Senior Subordinated Note until May 31, 2017 and further provided for the payment by Delphax Canada to the Company of a forbearance fee equal to approximately $141,000. At March 31, 2017, Delphax Canada was not in compliance with financial covenants under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding the existence of these events of default, the Company permitted additional borrowings under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement to, among other things, fund a final production run by Delphax Canada of consumable products for its legacy printing systems, which production run was primarily completed over the first six months of calendar 2017. Delphax Canada is Delphax's sole manufacturing subsidiary.

Events of default under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement persisted. On July 13, 2017, the Company delivered a demand for payment and Notice of Intention to Enforce Security to Delphax Canada. On August 10, 2017, the Company foreclosed on all personal property and rights to undertakings of Delphax Canada. The Company foreclosed as a secured creditor with respect to amounts owed to it by Delphax Canada under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement. The Company provided notice of its intent to foreclose to Delphax Canada and its secured creditors and shareholder on July 26, 2017. The outstanding amount owed to the Company by Delphax Canada under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement on July 26, 2017 was approximately $1,510,000. The Company also submitted an application to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Bankruptcy and Insolvency (the "Ontario Court") seeking that Delphax Canada be adjudged bankrupt. On August 8, 2017, the Ontario Court issued an order adjudging Delphax Canada to be bankrupt. The recipients of the foreclosure notice did not object to the foreclosure or redeem. As a result, the foreclosure was completed on August 10, 2017, and the Company accepted the personal property and rights to undertakings of Delphax Canada in satisfaction of the amount secured by the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement.
 
As disclosed above, we have consolidated Delphax into our consolidated financial statements since November 2015. Since intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation, amounts due from Delphax and Delphax Canada to Air T are excluded from our consolidated financial statements. Because Delphax is a variable interest entity, the effect of interest expense arising under the Senior Subordinated Note and, since January 6, 2017, under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement, and other intercompany transactions, are reflected in the attribution of Delphax’s net income or losses to non-controlling interests in our consolidated statements of income (loss).
 
Contrail, Jet Yard and AirCo.  On July 18, 2016, Contrail Aviation, a subsidiary of the Company, completed the purchase of substantially all of the business assets of Contrail Aviation Support, Inc. (“Contrail Seller”). Prior to the asset sale, Contrail Seller, based in Verona, Wisconsin, engaged in the business of acquiring surplus commercial jet engines and components and supplying surplus and aftermarket commercial jet engine components. In connection with the acquisition, Contrail Aviation offered employment to all of Contrail Seller’s employees. The acquisition consideration paid to Contrail Seller included equity membership units in Contrail Aviation representing 21% of the total equity membership units in Contrail Aviation. As a result, the Company owns equity membership units in Contrail Aviation representing the remaining 79% of the total equity membership units in Contrail Aviation. In addition, Contrail Aviation has agreed to pay as additional deferred consideration to Contrail Seller up to a maximum of $1.5 million per year and $3.0 million in the aggregate based on Contrail Aviation’s EBITDA (as defined in the purchase agreement) measured during periods over the five years following the acquisition. Contrail Aviation and Contrail Seller also entered into put and call options permitting, at any time after the fifth anniversary of the asset sale closing date, Contrail Aviation at its election to purchase from Contrail Seller, and permitting Contrail Seller at its election to require Contrail Aviation to purchase from Contrail Seller, all of Contrail Seller’s equity membership interests in Contrail Aviation at a price to be agreed upon, or failing such an agreement to be determined pursuant to third-party appraisals in a specified process. 
 
On October 3, 2016, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company, Stratus Aero Partners, LLC (formerly, Global Aviation Partners, LLC), acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Jet Yard. Jet Yard is registered to operate a repair station under Part 145 of the regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration and its principal asset at the time of the Company’s acquisition was a lease from Pinal County, Arizona to approximately 48.5 acres of land at the Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona. Jet Yard was organized in 2014, entered into the lease in June 2016 and prior to our acquisition maintained de minimus operations. 
 
The aggregate cash consideration paid in these two acquisition transactions described above, after closing date adjustments and not including potential deferred payments to Contrail Seller, was approximately $4,048,000.
 
On May 2, 2017 and May 31, 2017, AirCo acquired the inventory and principal business assets, and assumed specified liabilities, of Aircraft Instrument and Radio Company, Incorporated, and Aircraft Instrument and Radio Services, Inc. (collectively the “AirCo Sellers”). The acquired business, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, distributes and sells airplane and aviation parts and maintains a license under Part 145 of the regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration. The consideration paid for the acquired business was approximately $2,400,000. The Company will reflect this acquired business in its consolidated financial statements beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
 
D&D GSE Support. On October 31, 2016, GAS acquired, effective as of October 1, 2016, substantially all of the assets of D&D GSE Support, Inc. (“D&D”) which was in the business of marketing, selling and providing aviation repair, equipment, parts, and maintenance sales services and products at the Fort Lauderdale airport. The total amount paid at closing in connection with this acquisition was $400,000, with an additional $100,000 paid 30 days after closing and an additional $100,000 payable in equal monthly installments of $16,667 commencing on November 1, 2016. Earn-out payments of up to $100,000 may also be payable based on specified performance for the twelve-month period ending September 30, 2017.

Overnight Air Cargo.
 
MAC and CSA are two of seven companies in the U.S. that have North American feeder airlines under contract with FedEx. With a relationship with FedEx spanning over 35 years, MAC and CSA operate and maintain Cessna Caravan, ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft that fly daily small-package cargo routes throughout the eastern United States, upper Midwest and the Caribbean. MAC and CSA’s revenues are derived principally pursuant to “dry-lease” service contracts with FedEx. On June 1, 2015, MAC and CSA entered into new dry-lease agreements with FedEx which together cover all of the revenue aircraft operated by MAC and CSA and replaced all prior dry-lease service contracts.  These dry-lease agreements provide for the lease of specified aircraft by MAC and CSA in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased, which monthly rent was increased from the prior dry-lease service contracts to reflect an estimate of a fair market rental rate.  These dry-lease agreements provide that FedEx determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by MAC and CSA, with all other operational decisions made by MAC and CSA, respectively.  The current dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of MAC and CSA’s costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. Unlike prior dry-lease contracts, under the dry-lease agreements, certain operational costs incurred by MAC and CSA in operating the aircraft are not reimbursed by FedEx at cost, and such operational costs are borne solely by MAC and CSA.  Under the dry-lease agreements, MAC and CSA are required to perform maintenance of the leased aircraft in return for a maintenance fee based upon an hourly maintenance labor rate, which has been increased from the rate in place under the prior dry-lease service contracts. Under prior dry-lease service contracts, the hourly maintenance labor rate had not been adjusted since 2008. The dry-lease agreements provide for the payment by FedEx to MAC and CSA of a monthly administrative fee based on the number and type of aircraft leased and routes operated.  The amount of the monthly administrative fee under the new dry-lease agreements is greater than under the prior dry-lease service contracts with FedEx, in part to reflect the greater monthly lease payment per aircraft and the fact that certain operational costs borne by MAC and CSA are not reimbursed. The amount of the administrative fee is subject to adjustment based on the number of aircraft operated, routes flown and whether aircraft are considered to be soft-parked. Since MAC and CSA entered into the new dry-lease agreements in 2015, they have periodically entered into amendments to the agreements with FedEx that have adjusted the administrative fees payable under these agreements. These adjustments, which have generally been made on an annual basis, have resulted in annual period-to-period volatility in MAC and CSA’s profitability. MAC and CSA entered into such an amendment effective as of June 1, 2017 which is expected to positively affect MAC and CSA’s profitability compared to results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. 
The current dry-lease agreements would expire, unless renewed, on May 31, 2020.  The dry-lease agreements may be terminated by FedEx or MAC and CSA, respectively, at any time upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice.  In addition, each of the dry-lease agreements provides that FedEx may terminate the agreement upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes MAC or CSA’s only customer, or MAC or CSA employs less than six employees. As of the date of this report, FedEx would have been permitted to terminate each of the dry-lease agreements under this provision. The Company believes that the short-term nature of its agreements with FedEx is standard within the airfreight contract delivery service industry, where performance is measured on a daily basis. 
 
Under the dry-lease service contracts in place during the first two months of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and prior periods, FedEx leased its aircraft to MAC and CSA for a nominal amount and paid a monthly administrative fee to MAC and CSA to operate the aircraft. Under these contracts, all direct costs related to the operation of the aircraft (including fuel, outside maintenance, landing fees and pilot costs) were passed through to FedEx without markup. 
 
As of March 31, 2017, MAC and CSA had an aggregate of 80 aircraft under the dry-lease agreements with FedEx. Included within the 80 aircraft are 4 Cessna Caravan aircraft that are considered soft-parked. Soft-parked aircraft remain covered under MAC and CSA’s agreements with FedEx although at a reduced administrative fee compared to aircraft that are in operation. MAC and CSA continue to perform maintenance on soft-parked aircraft, but they are not crewed and MAC and CSA do not operate soft-parked aircraft on scheduled routes.
 
Revenues from MAC and CSA’s contracts with FedEx accounted for approximately 47% and 46% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The loss of FedEx as a customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company. FedEx has been a customer of the Company since 1980. MAC and CSA are not contractually precluded from providing services to other parties and MAC occasionally provides third-party maintenance services to other airline customers and the U.S. military.

MAC and CSA operate under separate aviation certifications. MAC is certified to operate under Part 121, Part 135 and Part 145 of the regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”). These certifications permit MAC to operate and maintain aircraft that can carry a maximum cargo capacity of 7,500 pounds on the Cessna Caravan 208B under Part 135 and a maximum cargo capacity of 14,000 pounds for the ATR-42 and 17,800 pounds for the ATR-72 aircraft under Part 121. CSA is certified to operate and maintain aircraft under Part 135 of the FAA regulations. This certification permits CSA to operate aircraft with a maximum cargo capacity of 7,500 pounds.
 

MAC and CSA, together, operated the following FedEx-owned cargo aircraft as of March 31, 2017: 
 

Type of Aircraft | Model Year | Form of Ownership | Number of Aircraft | 
----------------------------------------+------------+-------------------+--------------------+---
Cessna Caravan 208B (single turbo prop) | 1985-2012 | Dry lease | | 63
ATR-42 (twin turbo prop) | 1992 | Dry lease | | 9 
ATR-72 (twin turbo prop) | 1992 | Dry lease | | 8 
 | | | | 80

 

The Cessna Caravan 208B aircraft are maintained under an FAA Approved Aircraft Inspection Program (“AAIP”). The inspection intervals range from 100 to 200 hours. The current engine overhaul period on the Cessna aircraft is 8,000 hours.
 
The ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft are maintained under a FAA Part 121 continuous airworthiness maintenance program. The program consists of A and C service checks as well as calendar checks ranging from weekly to 12 years in duration. The engine overhaul period is 6,000 hours.
 
MAC and CSA operate in a niche market within a highly competitive contract cargo carrier market. MAC and CSA are two of seven carriers that operate within the United States as FedEx feeder carriers. MAC and CSA are benchmarked against the other five FedEx feeders based on safety, reliability, compliance with federal, state and applicable foreign regulations, price and other service related measurements. Accurate industry data is not available to indicate the Company’s position within its marketplace (in large measure because all of the Company’s direct competitors are privately held), but management believes that MAC and CSA, combined, constitute the largest contract carrier of the type described immediately above.
 
FedEx conducts periodic audits of MAC and CSA, and these audits are an integral part of the relationship between the carrier and FedEx. The audits test adherence to the dry-lease agreements and assess the carrier’s overall internal control environment, particularly as related to the processing of invoices of FedEx-reimbursable costs. The scope of these audits typically extends beyond simple validation of invoice data against the third-party supporting documentation. The audit teams generally investigate the operator’s processes and procedures for strong internal control procedures. The Company believes satisfactory audit results are critical to maintaining its relationship with FedEx. The audits conducted by FedEx are not designed to provide any assurance with respect to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and investors, in evaluating the Company’s consolidated financial statements, should not rely in any way on any such examination of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
The Company’s overnight air cargo operations are not materially seasonal.
 
Ground Equipment Sales.
 
GGS is located in Olathe, Kansas and manufactures, sells and services aircraft deicers and other specialized equipment sold to domestic and international passenger and cargo airlines, ground handling companies, the United States Air Force (“USAF”), airports and industrial customers. GGS’s product line includes aircraft deicers, scissor-type lifts, military and civilian decontamination units, flight-line tow tractors, glycol recovery vehicles and other specialized equipment. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, sales of deicing equipment accounted for approximately 49% of GGS’s revenues, compared to 82% in the prior fiscal year. This is principally due to the large order from a major airline in the prior year that did not reoccur in the fiscal year 2017.
 
 7



GGS designs and engineers its products. Components acquired from third-party suppliers are used in the assembly of its finished products. Components are sourced from a diverse supply chain. The primary components for mobile deicing equipment are the chassis (which is a commercial medium or heavy-duty truck), the fluid storage tank, a boom system, the fluid delivery system and heating equipment. The price of these components is influenced by raw material costs, principally high-strength carbon steels and stainless steel. GGS utilizes continuous improvements and other techniques to improve efficiencies and designs to minimize product price increases to its customers, to respond to regulatory changes, such as emission standards, and to incorporate technological improvements to enhance the efficiency of GGS’s products. Improvements have included the development of single operator mobile deicing units to replace units requiring two operators, a patented premium deicing blend system and a more efficient forced-air deicing system.
 
GGS manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment with capacities ranging from 700 to 2,800 gallons. GGS also offers fixed-pedestal-mounted deicers. Each model can be customized as requested by the customer, including single operator configuration, fire suppressant equipment, open basket or enclosed cab design, a patented forced-air deicing nozzle, on-board glycol blending system to substantially reduce glycol usage, and color and style of the exterior finish. GGS also manufactures five models of scissor-lift equipment, for catering, cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft, and has developed a line of decontamination equipment, flight-line tow tractors, glycol recovery vehicles and other special purpose mobile equipment.
 
GGS competes primarily on the basis of the quality and reliability of its products, prompt delivery, service and price. The market for aviation ground service equipment is highly competitive and directly related to the financial health of the aviation industry, weather patterns and changes in technology.
 
GGS’s mobile deicing equipment business has historically been seasonal, with revenues typically being lower in the fourth and first fiscal quarters as commercial deicers are typically delivered prior to the winter season. The Company has continued its efforts to reduce GGS’s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its international and domestic customer base and its product line. In July 2009, GGS was awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the USAF, which expired in July 2014. On May 15, 2014, GGS was awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the USAF. The initial contract award is for two years through July 13, 2016 with four additional one-year extension options that may be exercised by the USAF, the first of which was exercised, extending the contract term to July 13, 2018. The value of the contract, as well as the number of units to be delivered, depends upon annual requirements and available funding to the USAF.
 
GGS sold one deicer, the pre-production unit for the GL 1800 model deicer under this contract, to the USAF under the above contract during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, which pre-production unit was accepted by the USAF. In addition, GGS revenues and operating income have resumed their seasonal pattern. Delivery and acceptance of the pre-production unit is typically required by the USAF before further orders are submitted.
 
In September 2010, GGS was awarded a contract to supply flight-line tow tractors to the USAF. The contract award was for one year commencing September 28, 2010 with four additional one-year extension options exercisable by the USAF. All option periods under the contract have been exercised and the contract expired in September 2015, though it continues to govern orders placed under the contract prior to its expiration. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, GGS revenues included $3,174,000 of flight-line tow tractor sales to the USAF under this contract ($708,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016).
 
Because the USAF is not obligated to purchase a set or minimum number of units under these contracts, the value of these contracts, as well as the number of units to be delivered, depends upon the USAF’s requirements and available funding. GGS’s revenue from sales to the USAF, including under these contracts and for parts for units sold under prior contracts, accounted for approximately 14% and 3% of the segment’s revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Ground Support Services.
 
GAS, which was started by the Company in September 2007, provides aircraft ground support equipment, fleet, and facility maintenance services. At March 31, 2017, GAS was providing ground support equipment, fleet, and facility maintenance services to more than 114 customers at 84 North American airports. 
 
 8



Approximately 28% and 33%, respectively, of GAS’s revenues in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, were derived from services under a contract with LSG SkyChefs. The LSG SkyChefs contract is an evergreen agreement without a specific termination date but does include a 60-day termination clause for either party. In addition, approximately 14% and 15% of GAS’s revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, were derived from services under a contract with Delta Airlines. In December 2016, Delta awarded GAS a five-year contract at 28 locations in connection with their periodic request-for-proposal (RFP) process. Most significantly, GAS was awarded the maintenance of the baggage handling system and passenger boarding bridges for Delta’s hub operation at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. Not all Delta locations serviced by GAS were included in this RFP. With the new award, GAS estimates that annualized revenues for services at Delta locations, including existing Delta locations serviced by GAS that were not part of the 2016 RFP process, will be more than twice the annual run rate for services to Delta locations prior to the award. At March 31, 2017, GAS had over 90 technicians serving Delta in 44 locations. In addition to expanded locations with Delta, during the fiscal year 2017, GAS added multiple service locations to other key customers. In total, during the fiscal year 2017, GAS added 20 new served locations and over 100 additional technicians.
 
The October 2016 acquisition of the assets of D&D by GAS enhances GAS’s market position in South Florida and is expected to serve as a primary hub for ground support equipment maintenance services in South Florida and the Bahamas. 
 
GAS competes primarily on the basis of the quality, reliability and pricing of its services. The market for ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services is highly competitive and directly related to the financial health of the aviation industry. GAS’s maintenance service business is not materially seasonal.
 
Printing Equipment and Maintenance.

Delphax designs, manufactures and sells advanced digital print production equipment (including high-speed, high-volume cut-sheet and continuous roll-fed printers), maintenance contracts, spare parts, supplies and consumable items for these systems.  The equipment, spare parts, supplies and consumable items have been manufactured by, and maintenance services were provided by, Delphax’s subsidiary in Canada, and such products and services are sold through Delphax and its subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom and France.  A significant portion of Delphax’s net sales has historically been related to service and support provided after the sale, including the sale of consumable items for installed printing systems.  Historically, Delphax has had a significant presence in the check production marketplace in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.  Delphax’s primary manufacturing facility is located in Mississauga, Ontario.  Delphax’s common stock is traded on the over-the-counter market under the symbol “DLPX.” 
 
Our investments in Delphax were intended to support the commercial rollout and manufacturing costs of the new Delphax élan™ 500 digital color print system, which combines advances in inkjet and paper-handling technologies in a production class sheet-fed system offering full CMYK color and 1600 dpi print quality at speeds of up to 500 letter impressions per minute. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, Delphax was informed by its largest customer that the customer had decided to accelerate its plans for removing Delphax legacy printing systems from production and that Delphax should, as a consequence, expect the future volume of legacy product orders from the customer to decline markedly from prior forecasts. Furthermore, the future timeframe over which orders could be expected from this customer was sharply curtailed. In addition to this specific customer communication, Delphax also experienced a broad-based decline in legacy product customer demand during the first quarter. Sales of Delphax’s new élan printer system also had not materialized to expectations. 
 
The above described adverse business developments drove significant negative operating results and led to severe liquidity constraints for Delphax. In addition to other measures intended to respond to developments, Delphax engaged an outside advisory firm to assist with operations, cost reductions and expense rationalization, and to provide an objective assessment and recommendations regarding Delphax’s business outlook and alternative courses of action. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, a number of Delphax employees were either severed or furloughed. For most of fiscal year 2017 Delphax’s operations have been maintained at a significantly curtailed level. 
 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, Delphax initiated a final production run of consumable products for its legacy printing systems financed by borrowings from Air T under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement. Upon the completion of that production run, Delphax ceased the manufacture of consumable products for these legacy printing systems. As noted above, on August 10, 2017, the Company accepted the personal property and rights to undertakings of Delphax Canada in foreclosure in satisfaction of the amount secured by the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement. Delphax Canada is Delphax’s sole manufacturing subsidiary.

As of March 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Note was approximately $2,889,000 and the outstanding borrowings under the Delphax Senior Credit Agreement was approximately $1,873,000. 

Commercial Jet Engines and Parts.
  
Contrail Aviation and Jet Yard, added during fiscal year 2017, and AirCo, formed in May 2017 to acquire the business of the AirCo Sellers, comprise the commercial jet engines and parts segment of the Company’s operations. Contrail Aviation is a supplier of surplus and aftermarket commercial jet engine components. Its primary focus revolves around the CFM International CFM56-3/-5/-7 engines and the International Aero Engines V2500A5 engine, which power the two most prevalent narrow body, single aisle aircraft that are currently flown commercially—the Boeing 737 Classic / 737 NG and the Airbus A320 family. Contrail Aviation acquires commercial jet engines and components for disassembly and/or overhaul to useable components. Components are overhauled by third-party FAA-authorized repair agencies and are then held in inventory for resale. Customers include major airlines, original equipment manufacturers and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) service providers. Contrail Aviation holds an ASA-100 accreditation from the Aviation Suppliers Association. Contrail Aviation’s operations are housed in a 21,000 square-foot office and warehouse facility in Verona, Wisconsin that is leased from an entity owned by the shareholder of Contrail Seller, who joined Contrail Aviation as its Chief Executive Officer in connection with the acquisition, and by the individual appointed as Chief Financial Officer of Contrail Aviation following the acquisition. 
 
Jet Yard offers commercial aircraft storage, storage maintenance and aircraft disassembly/part-out services at facilities leased at the Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona.  The prevailing climate in this area of Arizona provides conditions conducive to long-term storage of aircraft.  Jet Yard is registered to operate a repair station under Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA and it leases approximately 48.5 acres of land under a lease agreement with Pinal County, Arizona.  Jet Yard was organized in 2014, entered into the lease in June 2016 and had maintained de minimus operations from formation through the date it was acquired by us. The lease expires in May 2046 with an option to renew for an additional 30-year period (though the lease to a 2.6 acre parcel of the leased premises may be terminated by Pinal County upon 90 days’ notice). The lease provides for an initial annual rent of $27,000, which rental rate escalates based on a schedule in annual increments during the first seven years of the lease (at which time the annual rental rate would be $152,000), and increases by an additional five percent for each three-year period thereafter. Because the rental expense will be accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, the rental expense in the initial years will exceed the corresponding cash payments. The lease agreement permits Pinal County to terminate the lease if Jet Yard fails to make substantial progress toward the construction of facilities on the leased premises in phases in accordance with a specified timetable, which includes, as the initial phase, the construction of a demolition pad to be completed by March 2017 and, as the final and most significant phase, the construction of an aircraft maintenance hangar large enough to house a Boeing B777-300 by the first quarter of 2021. The construction of the demolition pad specified under the lease has not been completed, and Jet Yard and Pinal County are in discussions with respect to improvements on the leased premises. Jet Yard offers its services to airlines, aircraft lessors and commercial aftermarket aircraft parts companies.
 
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, Contrail Aviation and Jet Yard revenues on a combined basis represented approximately 5% of the Company’s consolidated revenues.
 
AirCo operates an established business offering commercial aircraft parts sales, exchanges, procurement services, consignment programs and overhaul and repair services. Its repair station and support facility holds FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency certifications covering aircraft instrumentation, avionics and a range of accessories for civilian, military transport, regional/commuter and business/commercial jet and turboprop aircraft. AirCo operates at a 20,000 square-foot facility leased from the shareholder of the AirCo Seller. The lease duration is one year with an option for AirCo to extend the lease up to four additional one-year periods at the same terms. The lease provides that AirCo may terminate the lease on 90 days’ notice during the first year. Customers of AirCo include airlines and commercial aircraft leasing companies.

Leasing.
 
We organized ATGL on October 6, 2015. ATGL provides funding for equipment leasing transactions, which may include transactions for the leasing of equipment manufactured by GGS and Delphax and transactions initiated by third parties unrelated to equipment manufactured by us. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, ATGL contributed $538,000 to our consolidated revenues compared to $20,000 for the prior fiscal year.
Backlog.
 
GGS’s backlog consists of “firm” orders supported by customer purchase orders for the equipment sold by GGS. At March 31, 2017, GGS’s backlog of orders was $2.8 million, all of which GGS expects to be filled in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2016, GGS’s backlog of orders was $10.0 million. In addition, at March 31, 2017, Delphax’s backlog of “firm” orders supported by customer purchase orders for the equipment, goods and services that it sells was $3.6 million, all of which it expects to fill by in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018. Backlog is not meaningful for the Company’s other business segments.
Research and Development.
 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, Delphax incurred research and development expense of $1,042,000 compared to $778,000 from the period November 24, 2015 through March 31, 2016. Research and development expense incurred by Delphax relates to the development of its élan™ 500 digital color print system.
Governmental Regulation.
 
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies.
 
The Department of Transportation (“DOT”) has the authority to regulate air service. The DOT has authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations, and may, in certain circumstances, assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority and seek criminal sanctions.
 
Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires MAC and CSA to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us. 

The FAA has safety jurisdiction over flight operations generally, including flight equipment, flight and ground personnel training, examination and certification, certain ground facilities, flight equipment maintenance programs and procedures, examination and certification of mechanics, flight routes, air traffic control and communications and other matters. The FAA is concerned with safety and the regulation of flight operations generally, including equipment used, ground facilities, maintenance, communications and other matters. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness. The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations. The Company, through its subsidiaries, holds all operating airworthiness and other FAA certificates that are currently required for the conduct of its business, although these certificates may be suspended or revoked for cause. The FAA periodically conducts routine reviews of MAC and CSA’s operating procedures and flight and maintenance records.
 
In September 2010, the FAA proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots, and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft. When the FAA issued final regulations in December 2011, all-cargo carriers, including MAC and CSA, were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements, and instead were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules. In December 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of all cargo carriers from the new rule. It is reasonably possible, however, that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us.

The FAA has authority under the Noise Control Act of 1972, as amended, to monitor and regulate aircraft engine noise. The aircraft operated by the Company are in compliance with all such regulations promulgated by the FAA. Moreover, because the Company does not operate jet aircraft, noncompliance is not likely. Aircraft operated by us also comply with standards for aircraft exhaust emissions promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended.
 
Jet Yard and AirCo operate repair stations licensed under Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA. These certifications must be renewed annually, or in certain circumstances within 24 months. Certified repair stations are subject to periodic FAA inspection and audit. The repair station may not be relocated without written approval from the FAA.
 
Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft operations, the Company is also subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
 
Maintenance and Insurance.
 
The Company, through its subsidiaries, is required to maintain the aircraft it operates under the appropriate FAA and manufacturer standards and regulations.
 
The Company has secured public liability and property damage insurance in excess of minimum amounts required by the United States Department of Transportation.
 
The Company maintains cargo liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance and fire and extended coverage insurance for owned and leased facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company maintains product liability insurance with respect to injuries and loss arising from use of products sold and services provided.
 
In March 2014, the Company formed Space Age Insurance Company (“SAIC”), a captive insurance company licensed in Utah. SAIC insures risks of the Company and its subsidiaries that were not previously insured by the various Company insurance programs (including the risk of loss of key customers and contacts, administrative actions and regulatory changes); and may from time to time underwrite third-party risk through certain reinsurance arrangements. SAIC is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
Employees.
 
At March 31, 2017, the Company and its subsidiaries had 708 full-time and full-time-equivalent employees. This does not include the 40 employees of Delphax and its subsidiaries employed at March 31, 2017. None of the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries are represented by labor unions. The Company believes its relations with its employees are good.
