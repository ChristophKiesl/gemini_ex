Item 1.  Business
Overview
Exact Sciences Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Exact,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is a leading global cancer screening and diagnostics company. We have developed some of the most impactful brands in cancer diagnostics, and we are currently working on the development of additional tests, with the goal of bringing new, innovative cancer tests to patients throughout the world.
We are committed to providing earlier answers and life-changing treatment guidance to help people face the most challenging decisions with confidence. From earlier cancer detection to treatment guidance, we seek to help people get the answers they need to make more informed decisions across the cancer continuum. Our revenues are primarily generated by our laboratory testing services, from our Cologuard® colorectal cancer screening test, our Oncotype IQ® cancer diagnostic tests and services, and our COVID-19 test. 
We recently executed several significant and transformative projects and acquisitions to enhance shareholder value and bring new, innovative cancer tests to patients.
Significant recent developments include:
•Acquisition of Thrive—In January 2021, we acquired Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. (“Thrive”), a healthcare company dedicated to developing a blood-based, multi-cancer screening test. An early version of Thrive’s test achieved promising results with very few false positives in a 10,000-patient, prospective, interventional study detecting 10 different types of cancer, including seven with no recommended screening guidelines. 
•Exclusive License of TARDIS Technology —In January 2021, we acquired an exclusive license to The Translational Genomics Research Institute’s (“TGen”) proprietary Targeted Digital Sequencing (“TARDIS”) technology for use in minimal residual disease (“MRD”). We are currently seeking to utilize TARDIS’s compelling and technically distinct approach to develop a test to detect small amounts of tumor DNA that may remain in patients’ blood after they have undergone initial treatment. 
•Acquisition of Base Genomics—In October 2020, we acquired Base Genomics Limited (“Base”), an epigenetics company working to set a new standard in DNA methylation analysis, one of the most promising approaches to detecting cancer in its earliest stages.
•Extension of Mayo Collaboration—In September 2020, we amended and restated our license agreement with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“Mayo”), extending our productive collaboration with Mayo through January 2025. Pursuant to the agreement, Mayo dedicates personnel to provide us product development and research and development assistance.
•Launch of Covid-19 Testing—In March 2020, responding to the emergent public health crisis, we began providing Covid-19 testing. Since launch, we have provided more than 2 million results for residents in all 50 states.
•Acquisition of Paradigm—In March 2020, we acquired Paradigm Diagnostics, Inc., a commercial stage cancer diagnostic company. Leveraging Paradigm’s technology and laboratory, in October 2020 we launched the Oncotype MAP™ Pan-Cancer Tissue test (“Oncotype MAP” test).
•Acquisition of Viomics—In March 2020, we acquired Viomics, Inc., a development stage company with extensive sequencing capabilities and expertise in identifying unique biomarkers that indicate the presence of cancer in solid tissue and blood.
•Acquisition of Genomic Health—In November 2019, we acquired Genomic Health, Inc., a leading provider of genomic-based tests that help optimize cancer care, and its Oncotype IQ Genomic Intelligence Platform comprised of its flagship line of Oncotype DX® gene expression tests. The Genomic Health acquisition also provided us with a best-in-class international sales infrastructure.
Our Products and Services
With a leading portfolio of products for earlier cancer detection and treatment guidance, we provide patients with earlier, smarter answers. Our current products and services focus on screening tests and precision oncology tests. 
Our Cologuard Test
Our flagship screening product, the Cologuard test, is a patient-friendly non-invasive stool-based DNA (“sDNA”) screening test that utilizes a multi-target approach to detect DNA and hemoglobin biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Eleven biomarkers are targeted that have been shown to be strongly associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Methylation, mutation, and hemoglobin results are combined in the laboratory analysis through a proprietary algorithm to provide a single positive or negative reportable result.
We believe the large underserved population of unscreened and inadequately screened patients represents a significant opportunity for our Cologuard test. It is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least prevented cancers. Colorectal cancer can take up to 10-15 years to progress from a pre-cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death. Patients who are diagnosed early in the progression of the disease—with pre-cancerous lesions or polyps or early-stage cancer—are more likely to have a complete recovery and to be treated less expensively. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States (“U.S.”) and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. among non-smokers. Each year in the U.S. there are approximately 150,000 new cases of colorectal cancer and approximately 53,000 deaths from colorectal cancer.
Upon approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in August 2014, our Cologuard test became the first and only FDA-approved sDNA non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. In September 2019, the FDA expanded our Cologuard test's indication to include average-risk individuals ages 45-49. Our Cologuard test is now indicated for average risk adults 45 years of age and older. 
Our peer-reviewed study, “Multi-target Stool DNA Testing for Colorectal-Cancer Screening,”published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2014, highlighted the performance of the Cologuard test in its 10,000 patient Deep-C clinical trial:
•Cancer Sensitivity: 92%
•Stage I and II Cancer Sensitivity: 94%
•High-Grade Dysplasia Sensitivity: 69%
•Specificity: 87%
We believe the competitive advantages of sDNA screening provide a significant market opportunity. There are nearly 110 million Americans between the ages of 45 and 85 who are at average-risk for colorectal cancer. At a three-year screening interval and an average revenue per test of approximately $500 this represents a potential $18 billion market for our Cologuard test. 
An estimated 45 percent of Americans between the ages of 45 and 85 who are at average-risk for colorectal cancer are not up-to-date with screening according to the American Cancer Society’s (“ACS”) colorectal cancer screening guidelines.We believe our Cologuard test helps more people get screened for colorectal cancer. Internal studies have shown that nearly 50% of surveyed Cologuard users were previously unscreened for colorectal cancer. 
Our Cologuard test is included in key guidelines and quality measures that many healthcare providers rely on when making screening recommendations.
•The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (“USPSTF”) has given colorectal cancer screening in people ages 50-75 an “A” grade and included our Cologuard test (referred to in their statement as sDNA-FIT) as a recommended screening method for all average-risk patients in that age group. In October 2020, the USPSTF released draft updated recommendation statement that added a “B” grade for colorectal cancer screening for people ages 45-49. We expect that USPSTF will release final updated guidelines in 2021.
•The American Cancer Society has specifically included our Cologuard test as a recommended colorectal cancer screening test in average-risk asymptomatic individuals. The ACS recommends colorectal cancer screening beginning at age 45 for people at average-risk of colorectal cancer.
•The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) includes sDNA screening at a once-every-three-years interval in its Colorectal Cancer Screening Guidelines. 
•The National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”) includes sDNA testing on a three-year interval as one of the methods permitted for colorectal cancer screening in its most recent Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) quality measures.
•The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) includes our Cologuard test in its most recent Medicare Advantage Star Ratings program.
Our Oncotype IQ Tests 
With our Oncotype IQ Genomic Intelligence Platform we apply our world-class scientific and commercial expertise and infrastructure to lead the translation of clinical and genomic data into actionable results for treatment planning throughout the cancer patient's journey. We believe our Oncotype IQ tests improve the quality of treatment decisions and the health economics of cancer care. 
Our Oncotype IQ Genomic Intelligence Platform is currently comprised of:
•our flagship line of Oncotype DX gene expression tests for breast, prostate and colon cancers,
•Oncotype MAP, a tissue test delivering rapid, comprehensive tumor profiling to aid therapy selection for patients with advanced, metastatic, refractory or recurrent cancer, and 
•Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect® test, a liquid-based test for advanced stage prostate cancer. 
Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Tests
Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score® Test
Our Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test has been demonstrated to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from chemotherapy as well as those who may receive no clinical benefit from chemotherapy. We have delivered more than 1.3 million Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score tests to cancer patients since launching the product in 2004. 
Among women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death. In 2021, more than 281,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the United States according to ACS, along with more than 49,000 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer. Worldwide, it is estimated that there are approximately 2.1 million newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer each year. 
The Oncotype DX breast cancer test examines the activity of 21 genes in a patient’s breast tumor tissue to provide personalized information for tailoring treatment based on the biology of the patient's individual disease. The test is supported by multiple rigorous clinical validation studies, including the landmark TAILORx and RxPONDER studies, confirming the test’s ability to predict the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit as well as the chance of cancer recurrence in certain common types of early-stage breast cancer. 
As the only test proven to predict chemotherapy benefit, the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test is included in all major cancer guidelines worldwide, and is considered a standard of care for women with early-stage breast cancer.
Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score® Test
Our Oncotype DX DCIS test provides ductal carcinoma in situ ("DCIS") patients an individualized prediction of the 10-year risk of local recurrence (DCIS or invasive carcinoma), represented by a DCIS Score® result. This test helps guide treatment decision-making in women with DCIS treated by local excision, with or without tamoxifen. Development of our Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score test was based on published results for the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test that showed similarity in the expression profiles of genes between DCIS and invasive breast cancer when both are present within the same patient tumor.
Oncotype DX Colon Recurrence Score® Test 
In patients with stage II and stage III colon cancer, the decision to treat with chemotherapy following surgery is based on an assessment of the likelihood of cancer recurrence and as a result, it is critical for clinicians to accurately assess a patient's risk of recurrence. Our Oncotype DX Colon Recurrence Score test is a multi-gene test for predicting recurrence risk in patients with stage II and stage III A/B colon cancer to enable an individualized approach to treatment planning. By evaluating specific genes within a patient’s colon tumor, the test can determine the likelihood that the cancer cells will spread and cause the disease to return after surgery. Based on this information, healthcare providers and patients can make a more informed treatment decisions. The Oncotype DX colon cancer test is supported by three rigorous clinical validation studies confirming the test’s ability to provide additional and independent value beyond the currently used measures for determining colon cancer recurrence risk. 
Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score® Test
Worldwide, prostate cancer ranks as the second most frequent cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in men. Our Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (“GPSTM”) test helps men newly diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer to make the most informed treatment decision for their individual disease, including active surveillance. Our prostate needle biopsy-based, multi-gene test has been clinically validated to predict aggressive cancer at the time of diagnosis, helping to identify those men who need immediate surgery or radiation therapy versus those who can confidently choose active surveillance. The result is a more precise and accurate assessment of risk, which helps more men avoid the lifelong complications associated with treatments they do not need, while directing aggressive therapy to those men who require immediate treatment.
Oncotype MAP Pan-Cancer Tissue Test
In October 2020 we introduced the Oncotype MAP test. The Oncotype MAP test is a rapid, comprehensive tumor profiling panel that aids therapy selection for patients with advanced, metastatic, refractory, or recurrent cancer. The Oncotype MAP test utilizes next generation sequencing and immunohistochemistry to provide in-depth insights into genomic alterations in hundreds of cancer-related genes. The Oncotype MAP test report supports clinical decision making by showing actionable biomarkers associated with more than 100 evidence-based therapies, over 45 combination therapies, and more than 650 active clinical trial associations. The identification of these biomarkers helps to inform treatment options for a breadth of solid tumor types. 
Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect Test
Our Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test is a blood-based test designed to guide treatment decisions for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”), an advanced stage of the disease in which the cancer continues to grow and spread despite androgen deprivation therapy. mCRPC is often treated with androgen receptor-signaling inhibitor (“ARSI”) therapies. However, one in three patients become resistant to ARSI therapy after two rounds of treatment, leading to poor outcomes and unnecessary treatment costs. Epic Sciences developed and performs the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test. We commercialize the test pursuant to an exclusive license and distribution agreement with Epic Sciences.
Covid-19 Testing
In late March 2020, we began providing COVID-19 testing. We have partnered with various customers, including the State of Wisconsin Department of Health, to administer testing. Customers are responsible for employing trained personnel to collect specimens. Specimens are sent to our laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin, where we run the assay in our laboratories and provide test results to ordering providers. In light of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to periodically reassess offering COVID-19 testing.
Pipeline Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are focused on developing new products and enhancing existing products to address new cancer areas and expand the clinical utility and addressable patient populations for our existing tests. We are focused on enhancing our Cologuard test's performance characteristics and developing blood and other fluid-based ("liquid biopsy") tests. These development efforts may lead to a variety of possible new products, including risk assessment, screening and prevention, early disease diagnosis, adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant disease treatment, metastatic disease treatment selection and patient monitoring.
Through our collaboration with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, we have successfully performed validation studies on multiple types of cancer using tissue, blood, and other samples. In September 2020, Mayo agreed to make available certain personnel to provide us research development assistance through January 2025. Through recent business development activities, we have acquired exclusive access to technologies developed by The Johns Hopkins University, TGen, Oxford University and the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research.
We expect to advance liquid biopsy through biomarker discovery and validation in tissue, blood, or other fluids and to leverage recent business development activities to accelerate our leadership in earlier cancer detection and treatment guidance. We are pursuing the following opportunities:
•Colon Cancer Screening. We are seeking opportunities to improve upon our Cologuard test's performance characteristics. In October 2019, we and Mayo presented at the American College of Gastroenterology’s 2019 Annual Scientific Meeting findings from a blinded-case control study showing enhanced colorectal cancer and advanced adenoma detection using newly discovered methylation biomarkers. In October 2020, we acquired Base Genomics, whose methylation analysis technologies promise to build upon other contemplated enhancements to our Cologuard test. To establish the performance of an enhanced multi-target stool DNA test, we expect to enroll more than 10,000 patients 40 years of age and older in our multi-center, prospective BLUE-C study. The timing of any such enhancements to our Cologuard test is unknown and would be subject to FDA approval. We are also working to develop a blood-based screening test for colorectal cancer.
•Multi-Cancer Screening Test Development. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based, multi-cancer screening test. In January 2021, we completed the acquisition of Thrive Earlier Detection Corp., a healthcare company dedicated to developing a blood-based, multi-cancer screening test. An early version of Thrive’s test has achieved promising results in a 10,000-patient, prospective, interventional study detecting 10 different types of cancer, including seven with no current recommended screening guidelines, with very few false positives. We are exploring opportunities to incorporate Exact’s and Base Genomics’ methylation technologies into Thrive's test in order to enhance the test's accuracy and accelerate the widespread adoption of this potentially life-saving advancement.
•Hepatocellular Carcinoma (“HCC”) Test Development. We are currently seeking to develop a blood-based biomarker test to serve as an alternative to ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein (“AFP”) for use in HCC testing. HCC is the most common type of liver cancer. Our goal is to develop a patient-friendly test that performs better than the current standard of care. In November 2019, we released the results of a 450-patient study which demonstrated 80% overall sensitivity at 90% specificity with a novel combination of six blood-based biomarkers for HCC. The study also showed 71% sensitivity for early stage HCC at 90% specificity. The study compared performance to the AFP test, which demonstrated 45% sensitivity at 90% specificity for early stage HCC. 
•Minimal Residual Disease (“MRD”) Test Development. In January 2021 we acquired an exclusive license to the TGen proprietary TARDIS technology. We are currently seeking to utilize this compelling and technically distinct approach to develop a test to detect small amounts of tumor DNA that may remain in patients’ blood after they have undergone initial treatment. In a study published in Science Translational Medicine, TARDIS demonstrated high accuracy in assessing molecular response and residual disease during neoadjuvant therapy to treat breast cancer. TARDIS achieved up to 100-fold improvement beyond the current limit of circulating tumor DNA detection.
•Development Studies for Oncotype DX Products. We may also conduct or fund clinical studies that could support additional opportunities for our Oncotype DX products. For example, we are exploring clinical studies to expand the use of genomic testing to address additional populations, including higher-risk patients. 
Research and development, which includes our clinical study programs, accounts for a material portion of our operating expenses. As we seek to enhance our current product portfolio and expand our product pipeline by developing additional cancer screening and diagnostic tests, we expect that our research and development expenditures will continue to increase.
Commercial Operations
We operate within a single business segment, with commercial teams focused on screening, precision oncology, and international markets. Beginning in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began to disrupt our commercial operations, including by causing us to suspend face-to-face interactions between sales representatives and healthcare providers. Although a portion of our sales force has no recommenced field-based interactions, access to healthcare providers remains limited.
Cologuard Test Commercial Operations
We promote our Cologuard test through our primary care, gastroenterology, women’s health and health systems field sales teams, as well as through an inside sales team. In addition, Pfizer, Inc. ("Pfizer") promotes our Cologuard test and provides certain sales, marketing, analytical and other commercial operations support pursuant to a Promotion Agreement.
Our sales team actively engages with healthcare providers and their staffs to emphasize the need for colorectal cancer screening, educate them on the value of our Cologuard test, and facilitate their ability to order the test. We focus on specific healthcare providers based on a combination of Cologuard order history and ordering potential. We also focus on healthcare provider groups and larger regional and national health systems. 
A critical part of the value proposition of our Cologuard test is its adherence program, which involves active engagement with patients and providers. This customer-oriented support activity is focused on encouraging and helping patients to complete Cologuard tests that have been ordered for them by their providers. We may undertake several activities to promote patient adherence including letters, text messages, online chat, emails, and phone calls.
We have undertaken a significant public relations effort to engage patients in the U.S., and launched demographically-targeted, direct-to-patient advertising campaigns in digital, social, print, and other channels. We promote our Cologuard test through a national television advertising campaign, with a majority of placements in national cable and syndicated programming widely viewed by our target patient demographic. During 2020, in response to COVID-19, we deepened our investment in virtual resources, including launching a telehealth option for patients which can be found on Cologuard.com. We also built new capabilities to market our Cologuard test to health systems, with a focus on health information technologies. Following the FDA’s September 2019 expansion of Cologuard’s indication to average-risk individuals ages 45-49, we updated our direct-to-consumer efforts to educate and motivate this younger population to screen with our Cologuard test.
Oncotype IQ Commercial Operations
We promote our Oncotype IQ tests through our precision oncology sales force. Our commercial infrastructure, including our sales force, managed care group, and patient support network, is critical to the future success of our Oncotype IQ products. In our domestic sales, marketing and reimbursement efforts, we interact directly with medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists, urologists, pathologists and payers. We employ a direct sales approach that targets oncologists, cancer surgeons and urologists, and utilizes medical education and scientific liaisons who target key opinion leaders. We also plan to continue conducting clinical studies with the objective of having results published in peer-reviewed journals. We believe the combination of these approaches is our best means to increase patient and healthcare provider awareness of our products and services and the number of favorable reimbursement coverage decisions by third-party payers. 
International Commercial Operations
We now commercialize our Oncotype IQ tests internationally through employees in Canada, Japan and six European countries, as well as through exclusive distribution agreements. We do not offer our Cologuard test outside of the U.S. We have provided our Oncotype IQ tests in more than 90 countries outside of the U.S.
Inclusion of our products in guidelines and quality measures will be critical to our international success. The Oncotype DX breast cancer test is recognized in international guidelines issued by the St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Expert Panel and European Society for Medical Oncology. Our Oncotype DX breast cancer test has been recommended to guide certain patients' chemotherapy treatment decisions by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England, the Gynecologic Oncology Working Group in Germany and the Japan Breast Cancer Society. Our Oncotype DX breast cancer test is reimbursed for certain patients in the public health systems in more than ten countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom ("U.K."), and Canada.
We are exploring opportunities to establish local laboratories in certain locations outside of the U.S. Certain countries have severe restrictions on exporting tissue samples. These restrictions limit our ability to offer our tests in those countries without local laboratories or a method of test delivery that does not require samples to be transported to our U.S. laboratory.
Reimbursement for our Tests
Reimbursement for our Cologuard Test
Our Cologuard test has broad reimbursement coverage from Medicare and most private payers. As outlined in CMS’s National Coverage Determination (“NCD”), Medicare Part B covers our Cologuard test once every three years for beneficiaries who meet all of the following criteria:
•age 50 to 85 years,
•asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including, but not limited to, lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test), and
•at average risk for developing colorectal cancer (e.g., no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis; no family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer).
In addition to Medicare reimbursement, most commercial payers have issued positive coverage decisions for our Cologuard test, and we continue to negotiate contracts with payers to include our Cologuard test as an in-network service. In-network agreements with payers have varying terms and conditions, including reimbursement rate, term and termination. Some payers may apply various medical management requirements, including a requirement that they give prior authorization for a Cologuard test before they are willing to pay for it. Other payers may perform post-payment reviews or audits, which could lead to payment recoupments. 
The following laws and regulations establish coverage requirements relevant to our Cologuard test. 
•Section 2713 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) mandates that certain health insurers cover, without imposing any patient cost-sharing, evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of “A” or “B” in the current recommendations of USPSTF (“ACA Mandate”). 
•Federal regulations require that Medicare Advantage plans cover “A” or “B” rated preventive services without patient cost-sharing, and CMS has issued a notice affirming that Medicare Advantage plans must include coverage of our Cologuard test every three years without patient cost-sharing.
•We believe the laws of approximately 30 states currently mandate coverage of our Cologuard test by certain health insurance plans. 
The federal laws and regulations referenced above currently mandate coverage for individuals beginning at age 50. We believe that if the draft USPSTF colorectal cancer screening guidelines become final as currently written, the ACA mandate would, after a transition period, begin at age 45. While most of the state mandates apply beginning at age 50, we believe some should be interpreted to require coverage beginning at age 45.
Reimbursement for our Oncotype IQ Tests
We depend on government insurance plans, managed care organizations and private insurance plans for reimbursement of our Oncotype IQ tests.
Medicare coverage for our Oncotype IQ tests is currently subject to the discretion of the local Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MAC”). Palmetto, the MAC that establishes the coverage and coding policies for most of our tests under Medicare, developed the Molecular Diagnostic Services Program (“MolDx”), to identify and establish Medicare coverage for molecular diagnostic tests that fall within the scope of its Molecular Diagnostic Test local coverage decision (“LCD”). To obtain coverage under the MolDx program, developers of molecular diagnostic tests must submit a detailed dossier of analytical and clinical data to substantiate that a test meets Medicare’s requirements for coverage. To date, Palmetto has determined that our invasive breast and colon cancer tests will be covered, and that our prostate cancer test will be covered for patients with specified risk levels. Coverage determinations for our tests made by Palmetto under the MolDx program have been adopted by Noridian Healthcare Solutions, the MAC that processes Medicare claims submitted by us. 
Reimbursement of our Oncotype IQ tests by third-party payers is essential to our commercial success. Where there is a payer policy, contract or agreement in place, we bill the third-party payer, the hospital or referring laboratory and/or the patient (for deductibles and coinsurance or copayments, where applicable) in accordance with established policy, contract or agreement terms. Where there is no payer policy in place, we pursue third-party reimbursement on behalf of each patient on a case-by-case basis. Our efforts on behalf of these patients involve a substantial amount of time and expense, and bills may not be paid for many months, if at all. Furthermore, if a third-party payer denies coverage after final appeal, it may take a substantial amount of time to collect from the patient, if we are able to collect at all.
State Medicaid agencies generally assign a reimbursement rate for our Oncotype IQ tests equal to or less than the prevailing Medicare rate, often determined by state law as a percentage of the Medicare reimbursement rate.
International Reimbursement
In many countries, governments are primarily responsible for financing and establishing reimbursement for diagnostic tests. The majority of our international Oncotype IQ test revenues come from reimbursement, payments from our distributors, and patient self-pay. We have obtained coverage for our invasive breast cancer test outside of the U.S., including coverage for certain patients in Canada, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and the U.K.
We expect that our international sales will be heavily dependent on the availability of reimbursement, and broadening coverage and reimbursement for our Oncotype IQ tests outside of the United States will take years.
Reimbursement for Future Products
Successful commercialization of our newly developed products and products in development will also depend on our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement from government insurance plans, managed care organizations and private insurance plans for such products.
Our Clinical Laboratory and Manufacturing Facilities
We process our Cologuard test at two state of the art, high throughput clinical laboratories in Madison, Wisconsin that are certified pursuant to federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) and accredited by College of American Pathologists (“CAP”). Our total lab capacity at both facilities is approximately seven million Cologuard tests per year, with the opportunity to add additional capacity, if needed. 
We currently manufacture our Cologuard test at two facilities in Madison, Wisconsin. In 2020 we completed the construction of our second manufacturing facility, and we were granted FDA approval for commercial production in July 2020. We are committed to manufacturing and providing medical devices and related products that meet customer expectations and applicable regulatory requirements. We adhere to manufacturing and safety standards required by federal, state, and local laws and regulations and operate our manufacturing facilities under a quality management system. We purchase certain components for our Cologuard test from third-party suppliers and manufacturers.
We are committed to responding to the challenges posed by the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. Beginning in March 2020, we allocated space at our clinical laboratories in Madison, Wisconsin to process our COVID-19 tests. We also manufacture and assemble our COVID-19 test kits at our manufacturing facilities in Madison, Wisconsin. 
All internally developed Oncotype DX tests for domestic and international patients are currently processed in our clinical reference laboratory facilities in Redwood City, California, which is certified under CLIA and accredited by CAP. Our Oncotype MAP test is processed in our clinical reference laboratory facility in Phoenix, Arizona, which is certified under CLIA and accredited by CAP. The Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test, which was designed and validated by Epic Sciences, Inc. (“Epic Sciences”), is performed in its CLIA-accredited, CAP-certified clinical reference laboratory facility in San Diego, California.
We believe that we currently have sufficient capacity to process all of our tests. We may require additional facilities in the future as we expand our business and believe that additional space, when needed, will be available on market terms.
Competition
We operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. There are a number of private and public companies that offer products or have announced that they are developing products that compete with ours. Some of our current and potential competitors possess greater brand recognition, development capabilities, and financial and other resources than us. We expect to compete with a broad range of organizations in the U.S. and other countries that are engaged in the development, production and commercialization of cancer screening and diagnostic products and services. These competitors include:
•biotechnology, diagnostic and other life science companies,
•academic and scientific institutions,
•governmental agencies, and
•public and private research organizations.
The U.S. market for colorectal cancer screening is large, consisting of nearly 110 million eligible individuals between the ages of 45 and 85, and has attracted numerous competitors. Our Cologuard test faces competition from procedure-based detection technologies such as colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, “virtual” colonoscopy - a radiological imaging approach that visualizes the inside of the bowel by CT scan (spiral computerized axial tomography) - as well as other common screening tests, such as the fecal occult blood test ("FOBT") and the fecal immunochemical test (“FIT”), and other screening technologies. Newer screening technologies include liquid biopsy tests, such as Epi proColon, which was approved by the FDA in April 2016, and pill-based imaging solutions like PillCam COLON, which was cleared by the FDA in February 2014, and C-Scan, which obtained a CE Mark in early 2019. As noted below, a number of companies are developing liquid biopsy tests for colorectal cancer screening, as well as other applications.
We also are aware of at least three companies, DiaTech Pharmacogenetics, Prescient Metabiomics, and Geneoscopy, that are seeking to develop stool-based colorectal cancer tests in the United States. Our competitors may also be developing additional methods of detecting colorectal cancer and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced.
Notwithstanding that the market for colorectal cancer screening is highly competitive, we believe that our Cologuard test, as the first and only sDNA-based non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test on the market today, compares favorably to other available products and services. All other colorectal cancer detection methods in use today are constrained by some combination of poor sensitivity, poor adherence, and high cost. For example, colonoscopy requires advance dietary restrictions and bowel cleansing and can be uncomfortable, time-consuming, hazardous, and expensive. Colonoscopy requires sedation, potential lost time from work, and someone to drive the patient home from the procedure. A 2010 study shows that 7 out of 10 people age 50 and older who were told they should get a colonoscopy did not do so primarily due to fear. Fecal blood testing, including FIT testing, suffers from poor sensitivity, with only a 74 percent detection rate for cancer and 24 percent detection rate for pre-cancer. The blood-based DNA tests currently available are also disadvantaged by relatively low sensitivity. Epigenomics AG has reported that the Epi proColon test has an overall cancer sensitivity rate of 68 percent, and only 59 percent for early-stage cancer. Additionally, FIT testing suffers from low adherence over time. One study published in the American Journal of Managed Care demonstrated that only 3 out of every 1,000 patients studied adhered to fecal test screening guidelines during a continuous 10-year observation period. 
Our Oncotype IQ products compete against a number of companies that offer products or have conducted research to profile genes and gene expression in breast, colon, and prostate cancer. These companies include Agendia Inc., BioTheranostics, GenomeDx Biosciences Inc., Guardant Health, Inc., Hologic Inc., Myriad Genetics Inc. (and its Sividon Diagnostics subsidiary), NanoString Technologies Inc., NeoGenomics, Inc., OPKO Health, Inc. (and its Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc. subsidiary), Pacific Edge Limited, Qiagen N.V. and Veracyte, Inc. Historically, our principal competition for our Oncotype IQ tests has also come from existing diagnostic methods used by pathologists and oncologists, and such traditional diagnostic methods can be difficult to compete with or supplement. Our Oncotype IQ tests also face competition from commercial laboratories with strong distribution networks for diagnostic tests, such as Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings and Quest Diagnostics Incorporated. Other potential competitors include companies that develop diagnostic tests such as Roche Diagnostics, a division of Roche Holding, Ltd, and Siemens AG, as well as other companies and academic and research institutions.
For our prostate cancer tests, we face comparatively greater competition than for our breast cancer tests, including competition from products that were on the market prior to our product launch and that are supported by clinical studies and published data. This existing direct and indirect competition for tests and procedures may make it difficult to gain market share, impact our ability to obtain reimbursement or result in a substantial increase in resources necessary to successfully commercialize our Oncotype DX GPS prostate test and the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test.
We believe that our Oncotype IQ tests compete primarily on the basis of the value of the quantitative information they provide, the clinical validation of the utility of our tests, the level of adoption and reimbursement coverage for our tests, the inclusion of our tests in clinical practice guidelines, our ability to commercialize products through our clinical development platform, our ability to expand our sales efforts into new areas of medical practice as we launch new products, our collaborations with clinical study groups, the quality of our clinical laboratory, and the level of customer service we provide. While we believe that our Oncotype IQ tests compete favorably with respect to these factors, to continue to do so we must innovate and adopt advanced technology, successfully market, sell and enhance our tests, obtain peer-reviewed publications of our clinical studies in a timely manner, continue to obtain positive reimbursement determinations, continue to expand in countries outside of the U.S., continue to develop our technological and clinical operations, encourage healthcare provider participation in Medicare-required information collection efforts, and successfully expand our reach into additional product markets including through collaborations with third parties. 
In addition to our on-market products, we intend to offer additional liquid biopsy tests that:
•screen for colorectal cancer, 
•screen for multiple types of cancers using a single test,
•provide diagnostic information for liver cancer, 
•provide prognostic information, guide therapy selection, or measure minimal residual disease or cancer recurrence.
We are aware of a number of companies — including Bioprognos, Bluestar Genomics, Burning Rock, Caris Life Sciences, CellMax, Inc., Clinical Genomics, DiaCarta, EarlyDx, Epigenomics AG, Foundation Medicine, Freenome Inc., Glycotest, GRAIL, Inc., Guardant Health, Inc., Helio Health, Immunovia AB, Inivata, Invitae, JBS Science, Natera Inc., Nucleix Ltd., Singlera Genomics, Sysmex Ignostics, and Tempus — that have developed, or are developing, liquid biopsy tests for the detection of cancer, based on the detection of proteins, tumor cells, nucleic acids, epigenetic markers, or other biomarkers. These tests could represent significant competition for our current tests, including our Cologuard and Oncotype IQ tests, as well as other tests we may develop. Guardant Health, Inc. and Freenome Inc. are conducting prospective colorectal cancer screening clinical trials intended to support FDA approval, and other companies may do so in the future.
Competitors may develop their own versions of our tests in countries where we did not apply for patents, where our patents have not issued or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging healthcare providers or patients to use their tests in other countries. We are aware of at least one company that is offering or intends to offer in China a test that appears similar to our Cologuard test. Competitors also may be able to design around our intellectual property.
We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors either because their products and services are superior or because they may have more expertise, experience, financial resources, or stronger business relationships. These competitors may have broader product lines and greater name recognition than we do. Furthermore, even if we do develop new marketable products or services, our current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more commercially attractive than ours, and they may bring those products and services to market earlier or more effectively than us. If we are unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance for and sales of our tests, which could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or achieving sustained profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
Seasonality
We are continuing to learn how seasonal factors may affect our business. Based on our experience to date, we expect some seasonal variations in our financial results due to a variety of factors, such as the year-end holiday period and other major holidays, vacation patterns of both patients and healthcare providers, climate and weather conditions in our markets, seasonal conditions that may affect medical practices and provider activity, including for example influenza outbreaks that may reduce the percentage of patients that can be seen, and other factors relating to the timing of patient deductibles and co-insurance limits.
Regulation
Certain of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, distribution, and export of diagnostic products. Our clinical laboratory facilities are subject to oversight by CMS pursuant to CLIA, as well as agencies in various states, including New York. We are subject to many other federal, state and foreign laws, including anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback and patient privacy. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, civil money penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Devices subject to FDA regulation must undergo premarket review prior to commercialization unless the device is exempt from such review. The FDA granted premarket approval (“PMA”) for our Cologuard test in August 2014. The regulations governing Cologuard’s approval place substantial restrictions on how our Cologuard test is marketed and sold, specifically, by prescription only. In addition, as a condition of our FDA approval, we were required to conduct a post-approval study. The post-approval study concluded in 2020 and final results were submitted to the FDA in late 2020. There can be no assurance that the results of this study will be satisfactory and will not cause the FDA to modify or withdraw our approval for the Cologuard test.
Additionally, manufacturers of medical devices must comply with various regulatory requirements under the FDCA and regulations thereunder, including, but not limited to, quality system regulations, unless they are exempt, facility registration, product listing, labeling requirements, and certain post-market surveillance requirements. Entities that fail to comply with FDA requirements can be liable for criminal or civil penalties, such as recalls, detentions, orders to cease manufacturing, and restrictions on labeling and promotion, among other potential sanctions. In 2017, we recalled one of the components of our Cologuard test kit and circumstances may arise that cause us to recall other products or components used in connection with our Cologuard test.
Certain of our products in development or additional diagnostic products and services that we seek to develop may be regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The regulatory review and approval process for medical devices can be costly, timely, and uncertain. This process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and submitting a premarket clearance notice or filing a premarket approval application with the FDA. If premarket review is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that our tests will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that the labeling claims cleared or approved by the FDA will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our products. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations could increase the cost of conducting our business, subject us to FDA inspections and other regulatory actions, and potentially subject us to penalties in the event we fail to comply with such requirements.
Laboratory Developed Tests (“LDTs”)
Our Oncotype IQ tests are regulated as LDTs and we may seek to commercialize certain of our products in development as LDTs. LDTs are clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use. Historically, LDTs have been regulated under CLIA while the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion and not required approvals or clearances for many LDTs performed by CLIA-certified laboratories. The FDA has traditionally chosen not to exercise its authority to regulate LDTs because LDTs were limited in number, were relatively simple tests, and were typically used to diagnose rare diseases and uncommon conditions.
At various times since 2006, the FDA has issued documents outlining its intent to require varying levels of FDA oversight of many LDTs, including our tests. The FDA has yet to implement any form of oversight requirements with respect to LDTs, and it is unclear at this time if or when the FDA ends enforcement discretion for LDTs. It is also unclear whether the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time. Action by the FDA to exercise enforcement discretion over LDTs may materially impact our development and commercialization of LDTs, including without limitation our Oncotype IQ tests.
Laboratory Certification, Accreditation, and Licensing
We are also subject to U.S. and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. CLIA requirements and laws of certain states, including those of California, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Florida, impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. CLIA provides that a state may adopt different or more stringent regulations than federal law and permits states to apply for exemption from CLIA if the state’s laboratory laws are equivalent to or more stringent than CLIA. For example, the State of New York’s clinical laboratory regulations, which have received an exemption from CLIA, contain provisions that are in certain respects more stringent than federal law. Therefore, as long as New York maintains a licensure program that is CLIA-exempt, we will need to comply with New York’s clinical laboratory regulations in order to offer our clinical laboratory products and services in New York.
We have current certificates to perform clinical laboratory testing. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA and certain state laws include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any future CMS consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.
HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”) established comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or “Covered Entities”: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their business associates must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. We perform activities that may implicate HIPAA, such as providing clinical laboratory testing services and entering into specific kinds of relationships with Covered Entities and business associates of Covered Entities. Penalties for violations of HIPAA include civil money and criminal penalties.
Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws, which impose restrictions on the access, use and disclosure of personal information. More state and international privacy laws are being adopted. Many state laws are not preempted by HIPAA because they are more stringent or are broader in scope than HIPAA including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which protects personal information other than health information covered by HIPAA and allows certain data access and erasure rights to California consumers. Further, we are required to comply with international personal data protection laws and regulations, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR is a prescriptive, detailed regulation that provides extensive powers to public authorities to sanction and stop use of personal data. While companies are afforded some flexibility in determining how to comply with the GDPR’s various requirements, the GDPR has and will continue to require significant effort and expense to ensure compliance. All of these laws may impact our business and may change periodically, which could adversely affect our business operations. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain stool, tissue, blood, and other patient samples and associated patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans, including potentially a temporary inability to provide tests to patients in the European Union.
Federal and State Billing and Fraud and Abuse Laws
Anti-fraud Laws/Overpayments. We are subject to numerous federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws, including the Federal False Claims Act. Many of these anti-fraud laws are broad in scope, and neither the courts nor government agencies have extensively interpreted these laws. Prohibitions under some of these laws include:
•the submission of false claims or false information to government programs,
•the retention of any overpayments by governmental payers,
•deceptive or fraudulent conduct,
•excessive or unnecessary services or services at excessive prices, and
•defrauding private sector health insurers.
We may be subject to substantial penalties for violations of anti-fraud and abuse laws, including denial of payment and refunds or recoupments, suspension of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, as well as civil monetary and criminal penalties and imprisonment. Numerous federal and state agencies enforce the anti-fraud and abuse laws. In addition, private insurers may also bring private actions. In some circumstances, private whistleblowers are authorized to bring fraud suits on behalf of the government against providers and are entitled to receive a portion of any final recovery.
In addition, amendments to the False Claims Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from governmental payers. Within 60 days of identifying and quantifying an overpayment, a provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. These amendments could subject our procedures for identifying and processing payments to greater scrutiny. Overpayments may occur from time to time in the healthcare industry without any fraudulent intent. For example, overpayments may result from mistakes in reimbursement claim forms or from improper processing by governmental payers. We maintain protocols intended to identify any overpayments. From time to time we have identified overpayments and made refunds to government payers.
To avoid liability, we must carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, proactively monitor the accuracy and appropriateness of Medicare claims and payments received, diligently investigate any credible information indicating that we may have received an overpayment, and promptly return any overpayments.
Federal and State “Self-Referral” and “Anti-Kickback” Restrictions
If we or our operations are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations prohibiting improper referrals for healthcare services or products, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Anti-Kickback Statute. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, unless an exception applies. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Sanctions for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may include imprisonment and other criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors.
In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, in October 2018, Congress enacted the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”) as a component of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. EKRA is an anti-kickback law similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that, subject to several exceptions, makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Although it appears that EKRA was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written and can apply to laboratory services covered under public or private payer arrangements. That said, an interpretation of EKRA that prohibits certain incentive compensation payments to sales employees or other forms of remuneration that would otherwise be permissible under a safe harbor to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute would directly conflict with the intent of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and regulations and would prohibit a number of practices that are common throughout the industry. Significantly, EKRA permits the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but no such regulations or applicable guidance have yet been issued.
Self-Referral Law. The federal “self-referral” law, commonly referred to as the “Stark” law, provides that healthcare providers who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by healthcare providers who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions which, if met, permit healthcare providers who have ownership or 
compensation arrangements with a testing laboratory to make referrals to that laboratory and permit the laboratory to submit claims for Medicare payments for laboratory tests performed pursuant to such referrals. We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payers regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law.
Any action against us for violation of these or similar foreign laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.
Sunshine Act
In 2010, Congress enacted a statute commonly known as the Sunshine Act, which aims to promote transparency. The Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS any payments or other transfers of value made to healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, unless an exception applies. Manufacturers must also disclose to CMS any healthcare provider ownership or investment interests. Some states have similar transparency laws. Our failure to comply with any applicable transparency reporting requirements may subject us to substantial penalties.
International
When marketing our tests outside of the U.S., we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing, export of tissue, marketing approval for our products, and performance and reporting of tests in each market. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the U.S., and may require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. In many countries outside of the U.S., coverage, pricing, and reimbursement approvals are also required in order for our tests to be made available to patients in substantial volume.
Many countries in which we offer our tests have anti-kickback regulations prohibiting providers, as well as medical and in vitro diagnostic device manufacturers, from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, or providing a benefit to a healthcare professional in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any national healthcare program. In situations involving healthcare providers employed by public or state-funded institutions or national healthcare services, violation of the local anti-corruption or anti-gift laws may also constitute a violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”).
The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual, business entity, or employee of a U.S. business entity from offering or providing, directly or through a third party, including the distributors we rely on in certain markets, anything of value to a foreign government official with corrupt intent to influence an award or continuation of business or to gain an unfair advantage, whether or not such conduct violates local laws. In addition, it is illegal for a company that reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to have false or inaccurate books or records or to fail to maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We are also required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions, and its anti-bribery provisions.
Other Laws
Occupational Safety and Health. In addition to its comprehensive regulation of health and safety in the workplace in general, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements aimed specifically at laboratories and other healthcare-related facilities. In addition, because our operations require employees to use certain hazardous chemicals, we also must comply with regulations on hazard communication and hazardous chemicals in laboratories. These regulations require us, among other things, to develop written programs and plans, which must address methods for preventing and mitigating employee exposure, the use of personal protective equipment, and training.
Specimen Transportation. Our commercialization activities subject us to regulations of the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Postal Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens.
Environmental. The cost of compliance with federal, state, and local provisions related to the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the year ended December 31, 2020, and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contracts, such as confidentiality, material data transfer, and license and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely upon trade secret laws to protect unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation.
We have intellectual property rights pertaining to sample type, sample preparation, sample preservation, biomarkers, gene expression and sequencing technology, and related methods and formulations.
Our success depends upon our ability to protect our technologies through patent coverage. As of December 31, 2020, we had 130 issued patents in the U.S. and 733 issued patents outside of the U.S., which includes validated patents issued by the European Patent Office in key European Union countries, covering genes and methods that are components of the Cologuard test, Oncotype DX breast, colon and prostate cancer tests, pipeline technologies or research methods and platform technologies. In addition, we have a number of pending patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries, including provisional and non-provisional filings. Our issued U.S. patents expire at various times between 2022 and 2038. Some of these U.S. patent applications also have corresponding pending or granted applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty in Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, and other jurisdictions. In these patent applications, we have either sole or joint ownership positions. In certain cases where joint ownership positions were created, we have negotiated contractual provisions providing us with the opportunity to acquire exclusive rights under the patent applications. Under some patent applications, we have elected to allow exclusive options to lapse without exercising the option. The joint ownership agreements generally are in the form of material data transfer agreements that were executed at the onset of our collaborations with third parties. 
License Agreements
We license certain technologies that are, or may be, incorporated into our technology under several license agreements. Generally, the license agreements require us to pay royalties based on certain net revenues received, and may require minimum royalty amounts, milestone payments, and maintenance fees.
Mayo
In June 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Mayo, which was most recently amended in September 2020. Under the license agreement, Mayo granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to certain Mayo patents and patent applications, as well as a non-exclusive, worldwide license with regard to certain Mayo know-how. The scope of the license covers any screening, surveillance, or diagnostic test or tool for use in connection with any type of cancer, pre-cancer, disease, or condition.
The licensed Mayo patents and patent applications contain both method and composition claims that relate to sample processing, analytical testing, and data analysis associated with nucleic acid screening for cancers and other diseases. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Australia, Canada, the European Union, China, Japan, and Korea. Under the license agreement, we assumed the obligation and expense of prosecuting and maintaining the licensed Mayo patents and are obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to bring to market products using the licensed Mayo intellectual property.
Pursuant to our license agreement with Mayo, we are required to pay Mayo various low single-digit royalty rates on net sales of current and future products using the licensed Mayo intellectual property during the term of the Mayo agreement. 
In addition to the royalties described above, we are also required to pay Mayo cash of $0.2 million, $0.8 million, and $2.0 million upon each product using the licensed Mayo intellectual property reaching $5.0 million, $20.0 million, and $50.0 million in cumulative net sales, respectively.
As part of the September 2020 amendment, we agreed to pay Mayo an additional $6.3 million, payable in five annual installments, through 2024. The Company paid Mayo the first annual installment of $1.3 million in the third quarter of 2020 and will make subsequent annual payments in the first quarter of each year beginning in January 2021.
The license agreement will remain in effect, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the agreement, until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2038 (or later, if certain licensed patent applications are issued). However, if we are still using the licensed Mayo know-how or certain Mayo-provided biological specimens or their derivatives on such expiration 
date, the term shall continue until the earlier of the date we stop using such know-how and materials and the date that is five years after the last licensed patent expires. The license agreement contains customary termination provisions and permits Mayo to terminate the license agreement if we sue Mayo or its affiliates, other than any such suit claiming an uncured material breach by Mayo of the license agreement.
In addition to granting us a license to the covered Mayo intellectual property, Mayo provides us with research and development assistance pursuant to the license agreement and other collaborative arrangements. In September 2020, Mayo also agreed to make available certain personnel to provide such assistance through January 2025.
Hologic
In October 2009, we entered into a technology license agreement with Hologic, Inc. (“Hologic”). Under the license agreement, Hologic granted us an exclusive, worldwide license within the field of human stool based colorectal cancer and pre-cancer detection or identification with regard to certain Hologic patents, patent applications and improvements, including Hologic’s Invader detection chemistry (the “Covered Hologic IP”). The licensed patents and patent applications contain both method and composition-of-matter claims. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, and Korea. The license agreement also provided us with non-exclusive, worldwide licenses to the Covered Hologic IP within a field covering clinical diagnostic purposes relating to colorectal cancer (including cancer diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, or staging) and the field of detection or identification of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer through means other than human stool samples. In December 2012, we entered into an amendment to this license agreement with Hologic pursuant to which Hologic granted us a non-exclusive worldwide license to the Covered Hologic IP within the field of any disease or condition within, related to or affecting the gastrointestinal tract and/or appended mucosal surfaces.
We are required to pay Hologic a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of products using the Covered Hologic IP.
Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement, the license agreement will remain in effect until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2029. The agreement contains customary termination provisions which, among other things, permit termination in the event of material uncured breaches.
Human Capital
Our vision to pursue smarter solutions that provide the clarity to take life-changing action earlier drives us to find ambitious, dynamic individuals who thrive in a team-based environment. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Exact Sciences a diverse and inclusive workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs.
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 5,000 full-time, part-time and temporary employees, 4,800 of which were full-time employees. More than 95% of our employees are located in the United States and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. During fiscal year 2020, our voluntary turnover rate was less than 9%, below the healthcare industry benchmark, which is comprised of certain of our key competitors (Aon, 2020 Salary Increase and Turnover Study — Second Edition, September 2020).
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe diversity in thought, experience, perspective, and background within our team is necessary to support our core value of innovation. We are firmly committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and will not discriminate in any employment decision because of a person’s race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, veteran status, or any other basis prohibited by applicable law.
Our Senior VP of Human Resources is part of the executive leadership team and has direct responsibility for our diversity and inclusion program. We track and monitor workforce diversity data to ensure we are fulfilling our diversity and inclusion aspiration – to be known as a great place to work for all. Thanks, in part, to our competitive benefits, women make up approximately 55% of total employees (full-time and part-time), and 50% of management positions. Our board of directors includes four female members to support diversity of opinion and perspective at the board level as well. In addition, we have been awarded with a Great Place to Work® CertificationTM in 2020, Fortune's Best Workplaces in Health Care & BiopharmaTM in 2020, and Fortune's Best Workplaces for MillennialsTM in 2020.
Compensation and Benefits
Attracting the best talent starts with offering industry-leading compensation and benefits. We want our compensation and benefits to give our employees a sense of ownership in our company, and pride and determination to achieve our mission. We offer the following benefits, among others, to 100% of our U.S. employees, including part-time employees (subject, in certain cases, to minimum tenure or number of hours worked thresholds): medical, dental, and vision care coverage for all employees and their dependents; life, disability, and accident insurance and critical illness benefits; health care and dependent care flexible spending account programs; employer contributions to health savings accounts (for specific medical plans); 401(k) with employer matching; retirement planning resources; employee stock purchase plan; equity awards upon hire and annually thereafter; annual cash bonus program; parental leave program.
Training and Development
We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to achieve long-term success. We have implemented a comprehensive employee training program, governed by the Exact Sciences’ Employee Training Policy. The program applies to all our employees, including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees. Senior leadership, in conjunction with Human Resources, is responsible for ensuring that all personnel, including contractors and consultants, have the appropriate education, training, competency, and credentials.
Our organizational development team and functional training teams create opportunities for personal growth, professional growth, and career mobility. From facilitated workshops and podcasts to eLearning modules and succession planning, we have invested in internal capabilities to meet our employees at any stage of their career growth and development. We have also created a variety of tools to facilitate developmental feedback. Thanks, in large part, to our training and development investments, in 2020 we were able to fill 35% of our open positions with internal candidates.
