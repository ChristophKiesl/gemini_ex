Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins based on our proprietary ProCellEx® protein expression system, or ProCellEx. We developed our first commercial drug product, Elelyso®, using our ProCellEx system and we are now focused on utilizing the system to develop a pipeline of proprietary, clinically superior versions of recombinant therapeutic proteins that primarily target large, established pharmaceutical markets and that, in most cases, rely upon known biological mechanisms of action. With our experience to date, we believe ProCellEx will enable us to develop additional proprietary recombinant proteins that are therapeutically superior to existing recombinant proteins currently marketed for the same indications. We are now also applying the unique properties of our ProCellEx system for the oral delivery of therapeutic proteins.
 
The following table summarizes our current product candidates and their respective stages of clinical development:
 


On May 1, 2012, the FDA approved for sale our first commercial product, taliglucerase alfa for injection, an enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, for the long-term treatment of adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 Gaucher disease. Subsequently, taliglucerase alfa was approved for marketing by the regulatory authorities of other countries. Taliglucerase alfa is called alfataliglicerase in Brazil and certain other Latin American countries, where it is marketed under the name UplysoTM. Taliglucerase alfa is marketed under the name Elelyso in other territories.
 
Since its approval by the FDA, taliglucerase alfa has been marketed mainly in the United States by Pfizer, as provided in the exclusive license and supply agreement by and between Protalix Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Pfizer, which we refer to as the Pfizer Agreement. In October 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License and Supply Agreement, or the Amended Pfizer Agreement, which amends and restates the Pfizer Agreement in its entirety. Pursuant to the Amended Pfizer Agreement, we sold to Pfizer our share in the collaboration created under the initial Pfizer Agreement for the commercialization of Elelyso in exchange for a cash payment equal to $36.0 million. As part of the sale, we agreed to transfer our rights to Elelyso in Israel to Pfizer, while gaining full rights to Elelyso in Brazil. We will continue to manufacture drug substance for Pfizer, subject to certain terms and conditions. Under the initial Pfizer Agreement, Pfizer shared revenues and expenses for the development and commercialization of Elelyso with us on a 60%/40% basis globally, excluding Israel and Brazil. Under the Amended Pfizer Agreement, Pfizer is responsible for 100% of expenses, and entitled to all revenues globally for Elelyso, excluding Brazil, where we are responsible for all expenses and retain all revenues.

For the first 10-year period after the execution of the Amended Pfizer Agreement, we have agreed to sell drug substance to Pfizer for the production of Elelyso, and Pfizer maintains the right to extend the supply period for up to two additional 30-month periods subject to certain terms and conditions. Any failure to comply with our supply commitments may subject us to substantial financial penalties, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Amended Pfizer Agreement also includes customary provisions regarding cooperation for regulatory matters, patent enforcement, termination, indemnification and insurance requirements.
 
On June 18, 2013, we entered into a Supply and Technology Transfer Agreement, or the Brazil Agreement, with Fiocruz, an arm of the Brazilian Brazilian MoH, for taliglucerase alfa.
 
In December 2016, we received a letter from Fiocruz regarding an order from the Brazilian MoH to purchase alfataliglicerase to treat Gaucher patients in Brazil. The Brazilian MoH’s order consists of a number of shipments during 2017 for a total of approximately $24.3 million. Shipments are to start in mid-2017 and continue through the end of the year, in increasing volumes. Fiocruz’s purchases of Uplyso to date have been significantly below certain agreed upon purchase milestones and, accordingly, we have the right to terminate the Brazil Agreement. Notwithstanding the low purchase amounts, we are, at this time, continuing to supply Uplyso to Fiocruz under the Brazil Agreement, and patients continue to be treated with Uplyso in Brazil.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our operations are focused on our new strategy for accelerated growth, which was implemented in January 2015. The strategy centers around prioritizing existing and new pipeline candidates to focus on products that we believe offer a clear competitive advantage over existing treatments. The strategy was the culmination of two months of intensive review by our management of our internal resources and of the markets in which we expect we can operate. The following highlights the details of the strategic plan as it relates to our development of an innovative product pipeline using our ProCellEx protein expression system.
 
PRX-102 for the Treatment of Fabry disease. PRX-102, or alpha-GAL-A, is designed to be an improved enzyme replacement therapy product for the treatment of Fabry disease given its potential for clinically superior outcomes and enhanced safety when compared to currently marketed enzyme replacement therapies. The product candidate is a key focus for us. We enrolled our first patient in a phase III clinical trial of PRX-102 in the fourth quarter of 2016, and our phase I/II clinical trial is ongoing in an extension period.
 
alidornase alfa (PRX-110) for Cystic Fibrosis. alidornase alfa, our proprietary plant cell recombinant human Deoxyribonuclease 1, is under development for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), to be administered by inhalation. alidornase alfa has an actin inhibition resistance that is designed to improve lung function and lower the incidence of recurrent infections by enhancing the enzyme’s efficacy in patients’ sputa. It has demonstrated improved disease parameters in animal models and human sputum testing when compared to the currently marketed product. We have commenced a phase IIa clinical trial of alidornase alfa and in January 2017, we announced positive interim results from the phase II clinical trial for the first 13 CF patients enrolled in the study. Upon review of the final results of the trial, we will consider different collaboration alternatives as part of our further development plans.
 
Oral Anti-TNF (OPRX-106) Anti Inflammatory. Oral anti-TNF represents a novel mode of administering a recombinant anti-TNF protein. It is under development as an orally-delivered anti-inflammatory treatment using plant cells as a natural capsule for the expressed protein. The first patient in our phase II proof of concept efficacy study of OPRX-106 for the treatment of ulcerative colitis was dosed in November 2016. In August 2015, we announced positive clinical study results from our phase I clinical trial of OPRX-106. OPRX-106 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile and biological activity in the gut in the phase I study. Upon review of the proof of concept data, we intend to identify and collaborate with a well-suited partner for further development.
 
Potential Pipeline Candidates. We aim to expand our pipeline by leveraging the advantages of our proprietary ProCellEx protein expression technology. The focus is expected to be on biologics with improved clinical profiles than the currently marketed proteins for these indications. Biosimilars will not be a market on which we focus, and will only be considered in the case of proteins that are highly difficult to express or that represent opportunities for early market entry arising from the intellectual property advantages arising from ProCellEx.
 
Except for the rights to commercialize taliglucerase alfa worldwide (other than Brazil), which we licensed to Pfizer, we hold the worldwide commercialization rights to all of our proprietary development candidates. We continuously evaluate potential strategic marketing partnerships as well as collaboration programs with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutes.

ProCellEx: Our Proprietary Protein Expression System
 
ProCellEx is our proprietary production system. We have developed our ProCellEx system based on our plant cell culture technology for the development, expression and manufacture of recombinant proteins. Our protein expression system does not involve mammalian or animal components or transgenic field-grown, whole plants at any point in the production process. Our ProCellEx system consists of a comprehensive set of capabilities and proprietary technologies, including advanced genetic engineering and plant cell culture technology, which enables us to produce complex, proprietary and biologically equivalent proteins for a variety of human diseases. This protein expression system facilitates the creation and selection of high expressing, genetically stable cell lines capable of expressing recombinant proteins. The entire protein expression process, from initial nucleotide cloning to large-scale production of the protein product, occurs under cGMP-compliant, controlled processes. Our plant cell culture technology uses plant cells, such as carrot and tobacco cells, which undergo advanced genetic engineering and are grown on an industrial scale in a flexible bioreactor system. Cell growth, from scale up through large-scale production, takes place in flexible, sterile, polyethylene bioreactors which are confined to a clean-room environment. Our bioreactors are well-suited for plant cell growth using a simple, inexpensive, chemically-defined growth medium as a catalyst for growth. The reactors are custom-designed and optimized for plant cell cultures, easy to use, entail low initial capital investment, are rapidly scalable at a low cost and require less hands-on maintenance between cycles.
 
Our ProCellEx system is capable of producing proteins with an amino acid sequence and three dimensional structure practically equivalent to that of the desired human protein, and with a very similar, although not identical, glycan, or sugar, structure, as demonstrated in our internal research and external laboratory studies. In collaboration with the Weizmann Institute of Science, we have demonstrated that the three-dimensional structure of a protein expressed in our proprietary plant cell-based expression system retains the same three-dimensional structure as exhibited by the mammalian cell-based expressed version of the same protein. In addition, proteins produced by our ProCellEx system maintain the biological activity that characterize that of the naturally-produced proteins. Based on these results, we believe that proteins developed using our ProCellEx protein expression system have the intended composition and correct biological activity of their human equivalent proteins.
 
We believe that our ProCellEx system will enable us to develop recombinant therapeutic proteins yielding substantial cost advantages, accelerated development and other competitive benefits when compared to mammalian cell-based protein expression systems. In addition, our ProCellEx system may enable us, in certain cases, to develop and commercialize recombinant proteins without infringing upon the method-based patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. The major elements of our ProCellEx system are patent protected in most major countries. Moreover, we expect to enjoy method-based patent protection for the proteins we develop using our proprietary ProCellEx protein expression technology, although there can be no assurance that any such patents will be granted. In some cases, we may be able to obtain patent protection for the compositions of the proteins themselves. We have filed for United States and international composition of matter patents for taliglucerase alfa.
 
We have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our ProCellEx system through: (i) the FDA’s approval of taliglucerase alfa, and its subsequent approval by other regulatory authorities; (ii) the clinical and preclinical studies we have performed to date, including the positive efficacy and safety data in our clinical trials for taliglucerase alfa, PRX-102; (iii) alidornase alfa; OPRX-106 for the treatment of ulcerative colitis; (iv) preclinical results in well-known models in our enzyme for each of Fabry disease, DNase and antiTNF; and (v) by expressing, on an exploratory, research scale, many additional complex therapeutic proteins belonging to different drug classes, such as enzymes, hormones, monoclonal antibodies, cytokines and vaccines. The therapeutic proteins we have expressed to date in research models have produced the intended composition and similar biological activity compared to their respective human-equivalent proteins. Moreover, several of such proteins demonstrated advantageous biological activity when compared to the biotherapeutics currently available in the market to treat the applicable disease or disorder. We believe that the FDA’s approval of taliglucerase alfa represents a strong proof-of-concept of our ProCellEx system and plant cell-based protein expression technology. We also believe that the significant benefits of our ProCellEx system, if further substantiated in clinical trials and in the successful commercialization of taliglucerase alfa and our other product candidates, have the potential to transform the industry standard for the development of complex therapeutic proteins.
 
Mammalian cell-based expression technology is based on the introduction of a human gene encoding for a specific therapeutic protein into the genome of a mammalian cell, and such systems have become the dominant system for the expression of recombinant proteins due to their capacity for sophisticated, proper protein folding (which is necessary for proteins to carry out their intended biological activity), assembly and post-expression modification, such as glycosilation (the addition of sugar residues to a protein which is necessary to enable specific biological activity by the protein). Many of the biotechnology industry’s largest and most successful therapeutic proteins, including Epogen®, Neupogen®, Cerezyme®, Rituxan®, Humira®, Enbrel®, Neulasta®, Remicade® and Herceptin® are produced through mammalian cell-based expression systems. Mammalian cell-based expression systems can produce proteins with superior quality and efficacy compared to proteins expressed in bacteria and yeast cell-based systems. As a result, the majority of currently approved therapeutic proteins, as well as those under development, are produced in mammalian cell-based systems.

While bacterial and yeast cell-based expression systems were the first protein expression systems developed by the biotechnology industry and remain cost-effective compared to mammalian cell-based production methodologies, proteins expressed in bacterial and yeast cell-based systems lack the capacity for sophisticated protein folding, assembly and post-expression modifications, which are key factors of mammalian cell-based systems. Accordingly, such systems cannot be used to produce glycoproteins or other complex proteins and, therefore, bacterial and yeast cell-based systems are limited to the expression of the most basic, simple proteins, such as insulin and growth hormones.
 
Several companies and research institutions have been exploring the expression of human proteins in genetically-modified organisms, or GMOs, such as transgenic field-grown, whole plants and transgenic animals. However, these alternate techniques may be restricted by regulatory and environmental risks regarding contamination of agricultural crops and by the difficulty in applying cGMP standards of the pharmaceutical industry to these expression technologies and none of these technologies have been approved by the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over any substantial market.
 
To date, our manufacturing facility, in which we utilize our ProCellEx system, was determined to be acceptable by each of the FDA, European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, ANVISA, the Israeli MOH, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, or the TGA, and Health Canada, after GMP inspections were performed as part of their respective reviews for marketing approval of taliglucerase alfa.
 
Competitive Advantages of Our ProCellEx Protein Expression System
 
We intend to continue to leverage the multiple unique advantages of our proprietary ProCellEx protein expression system, including our advanced genetic engineering technology and plant cell-based protein expression methods, to develop our pipeline. Significant advantages of our ProCellEx system over mammalian, bacterial, yeast and transgenic cell-based expression technologies, include the following:
Biologic Optimization. ProCellEx has internal capabilities developed to improve the biologic dynamics of an expressed protein. For example, the proteins produced through our system have uniform glycosilation patterns and therefore do not require the lengthy and expensive post-expression modifications that are required for certain proteins produced by mammalian cell-based systems. Such post-expression modifications in mammalian cell-produced proteins are made in order to expose the terminal mannose sugar residues, which are structures on a protein that are key elements in allowing the expressed protein to bind to a target cell and subsequently be taken into the target cell for therapeutic benefit. In addition, these steps do not guarantee the exposure of all of the required terminal mannose sugar residues, resulting in potentially lower effective yields and inconsistency in potency from batch to batch. We believe this quality increases the potency and consistency of the expressed proteins, and thus, the effectiveness of the protein which presents an additional cost advantage of ProCellEx over competing protein expression methodologies.
Ability to Penetrate Certain Patent-Protected Markets. ProCellEx has the potential to provide workaround manufacturing that does not infringe the method-based patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Certain biotherapeutic proteins available for commercial sale are not protected by patents that cover the compound and are available for use in the public domain. Rather, the process of expressing the protein product in mammalian or bacterial cell systems is protected by method-based patents. Using our plant cell-based protein expression technology, we are able to express an equivalent protein without infringing upon these method-based patents. Moreover, we expect to enjoy method-based patent protection for the proteins we develop using our ProCellEx system, although there can be no assurance that any such patents will be granted. In some cases, we may be able to obtain patent protection for the compositions of the proteins themselves. We have filed for U.S. and international composition of matter patents for PRX-102 and certain of our other product candidates.
 
Broad Range of Expression Capabilities. ProCellEx is able to produce a broad array of complex glycosilated proteins, which are difficult to produce in other systems, such as bacterial and yeast cell-based systems, as well as CHO systems. We have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our ProCellEx system by producing, on an exploratory, research scale, a variety of therapeutic proteins belonging to different classes of recombinant drugs, such as enzymes, hormones, monoclonal antibodies, cytokines and vaccines. We have demonstrated that the recombinant proteins we have expressed to date have the intended composition and correct biological activity of their human-equivalent protein, with several of such proteins demonstrating advantageous biological activity compared to the currently available biotherapeutics. In specific cases, we have been successful in expressing proteins that have not been successfully expressed in other production systems.

Significantly Lower Capital and Production Costs. ProCellEx entails a lower cost of scale-up and of production. Plant cells grow rapidly under a variety of conditions and are not as sensitive as mammalian cells are to temperature, pH and oxygen levels which generally can only be grown under near perfect conditions. Our system, therefore, does not require the highly complex, expensive, stainless steel bioreactors typically used in mammalian cell-based production systems to maintain very specific temperature, pH and oxygen levels. Instead, we use simple polyethylene bioreactors that can be maintained at the room temperature of the clean-room in which they are placed. This system also reduces ongoing production and monitoring costs typically associated with mammalian cell-based expression technologies. Furthermore, while mammalian cell-based systems require very costly growth media at various stages of the production process to achieve target yields of proteins, plant cells require only simple and much less expensive solutions based on sugar, water and microelements at infrequent intervals to achieve target yields. Mammalian cell-based expression systems require large quantities of sophisticated and expensive growth medium to accelerate the expression process.
 
Elimination of the Risk of Viral Transmission or Infection by Mammalian Components. By nature, plant cells do not carry the risk of infection by human or other animal viruses. Mammalian cells, to the contrary, are susceptible to viral infections, including human viruses, and several cases of viral contamination have occurred. As a result, the risk of contamination of our products under development and the potential risk of viral transmission from our product and product candidates to future patients, whether from known or unknown mammalian viruses, is eliminated. Because our products and product candidates do not bear the risk of mammalian viral transmission, we are not required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to perform the constant monitoring procedures for mammalian viruses during the protein expression process that are required in mammalian cell-based production. In addition, the production process of our ProCellEx system is void of any mammalian components which are susceptible to the transmission of prions, such as those related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (commonly known as “mad-cow disease”). These factors further reduce the risks and operating costs of ProCellEx compared to mammalian cell-based expression systems.
 
The FDA and other regulatory authorities require viral inactivation and other rigorous and detailed procedures for mammalian cell-based manufacturing processes in order to address these potential hazards, thereby increasing the cost and time demands of such expression systems. Furthermore, the current FDA and other procedures only ensure screening for scientifically identified, known viruses. Accordingly, compliance with current FDA and other procedures does not fully guarantee that patients are protected against transmission of unknown or new potentially fatal viruses that may infect mammalian cells.
 
Potential ability to administer active therapeutic enzymes orally. We are using ProCellEx to produce active recombinant proteins through oral administration of plant cells expressing biotherapeutic proteins. In such method, an enzyme is naturally encapsulated within plant cells genetically engineered to express the targeted enzyme. Plant cells have the unique attribute of a cellulose cell wall which makes them resistant to enzyme degradation when passing through the digestive tract. The plant cell itself serves as a delivery vehicle, once released and absorbed, to transport an enzyme in active form to the bloodstream. If proven effective, this would be the first time an enzyme will be administered orally rather than through intravenous therapy. To date we have completed successful preclinical animal studies for oral GCD and oral antiTNF, and early clinical trials of oral GCD in Gaucher patients and oral antiTNF in a phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers and a currently ongoing phase IIa proof of concept trial. Our oral antiTNF product candidate is currently the subject of an ongoing phase IIa proof of concept trial and we have completed a phase I clinical trial of oral antiTNF in healthy volunteers. We have also completed an early clinical trial of oral GCD in Gaucher patients.
 
Our First Commercial Product – Elelyso for the Treatment of Gaucher Disease
 
Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa), our first commercial product, is a plant cell expressed recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme (GCD) for the treatment of Gaucher disease. On May 1, 2012, the FDA approved Elelyso for injection as an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the long-term treatment of adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 Gaucher disease. It was subsequently approved by the Israeli MOH, ANVISA and the regulatory authorities of other countries. In August 2014, the FDA approved Elelyso for injection for pediatric patients, and other jurisdictions, including Brazil, approved pediatric indications thereafter. 
 
Gaucher disease, a hereditary, genetic disorder with severe and debilitating symptoms, is the most prevalent lysosomal storage disorder in humans. Lysosomal storage disorders are metabolic disorders in which a lysosomal enzyme, a protein that degrades cellular substrates in the lysosomes of cells, is mutated or deficient. Lysosomes are small membrane-bound cellular structures within cells that contain enzymes necessary for intracellular digestion. Gaucher disease is caused by mutations or deficiencies in the gene encoding GCD, a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of the fatty substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Patients with Gaucher disease lack or otherwise have dysfunctional GCD and, accordingly, are not able to break down GlcCer. The GlcCer accumulates in lysosomes of certain white blood cells called macrophages which consequently become highly enlarged. The enlarged cells accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow and brain. Signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease may include enlarged liver and spleen, abnormally low levels of red blood cells and platelets and skeletal complications. In some cases, the patient may suffer an impairment of the central nervous system.

The standard of care for Gaucher disease is enzyme replacement therapy using recombinant GCD to replace the mutated or deficient natural GCD enzyme. Enzyme replacement therapy is a medical treatment in which recombinant enzymes are injected into patients in whom the enzyme is lacking or dysfunctional. Cerezyme® and VPRIV® are the only other ERTs currently available for the treatment of Gaucher disease. In addition, Cerdelga® (eliglustat) is a substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease that was approved for marketing by the FDA in August 2014 and by the European Commission in January 2015. Finally, Zavesca (miglustat) is a small molecule drug for the treatment of Gaucher disease. Zavesca has been approved by the FDA for use in the United States as an oral treatment. However, it has many side effects and the FDA has approved it only for administration to those patients who cannot be treated through ERT, and, accordingly, have no other treatment alternative. As a result, the use of Zavesca has been limited with respect to the treatment of Gaucher disease. However, Zavesca is also used to treat other rare disorders.
 
Our Pipeline Drug Candidates
 
PRX-102 for the Treatment of Fabry Disease
 
We are developing PRX-102, our proprietary plant cell expressed chemically modified version of the recombinant alpha-GAL-A protein, a therapeutic enzyme, for the treatment of Fabry disease, a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder. We believe that PRX-102 has the potential to be an improved version of the currently marketed Fabry disease enzymes, Fabrazyme® and Replagal®, with improved activity in the Fabry disease target organs and significantly longer half-life due to higher stability, which together can potentially lead to improved substrate clearance and significantly lower formation of antibodies, as observed in our phase I/II clinical trial in Fabry patients. We believe that the treatment of Fabry disease is a specialty clinical niche with the potential for high growth as there is a significant unmet medical need for Fabry disease treatments.
Fabry Disease Background
 
Fabry disease is characterized by subnormal or absent enzymatic activity of alpha-GAL-A, a lysosomal enzyme, which primarily catalyses the hydrolysis of terminal alpha-galactosyl groups of glycolipids, mainly the glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). The accumulation of Gb3 in body tissues results in Fabry disease. The ultimate consequence of glycosphingolipid deposition in the vasculature and other tissues is end-organ failure, particularly of the kidney, but also of the heart and cerebrovascular system. In addition, involvement of the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems results in episodes of pain and impaired peripheral sensation. In PRX-102, the prh-alpha-GALA, naturally occurring as a homodimer, is PEGylated and cross-linked to support and reinforce the homodimeric structure, which is crucial for the enzymatic activity of this enzyme. In clinical trials, PRX-102 has been shown to be taken up by Fabry patients’ cells where it localizes to the lysosome, in which Gb3 accumulates. PRX-102 is characterized by higher stability under physiologically relevant conditions, and extended circulation residence time as compared to current ERTs for Fabry disease.
Current Treatments of Fabry Disease
 
Currently there are two enzyme replacement therapies drugs available on the market to treat Fabry disease. Fabrazyme, marketed by Genzyme Corporation (acquired by Sanofi), is approved for the treatment of Fabry disease in the United States and the European Union. Sanofi reported €674 million (approximately $709 million) in worldwide sales of Fabrazyme in 2016. The other approved drug for the treatment of Fabry disease in the European Union is Replagal, which is marketed by Shire. Shire reported $452 million in sales of Replagal in 2016. In addition, there are other, non-ERT treatments for Fabry disease.
PRX-102 Development Program
 
In October 2016, the first patient was dosed in our global phase III clinical trial of PRX-102 for the treatment of Fabry disease. Over 20 sites have been opened to participate in this trial. The phase III efficacy and safety clinical trial, which we refer to as the BALANCE Study, is a 24-month multi-center, randomized, double-blind, active control study of PRX-102 in Fabry patients with impaired renal function. The trial is designed to enroll 78 patients previously treated with Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) with a stable dose for at least six months. Enrolled patients will be randomized to continue treatment with 1 mg/kg of either Fabrazyme or PRX-102, at a 2:1 ratio of PRX-102 to Fabrazyme, respectively. Patients are to be treated via intravenous (IV) infusions every two weeks. The sites are recruiting adult symptomatic Fabry patients with plasma and/or leucocyte alpha galactosidase activity (by activity assay) less than 30% mean normal levels. All patients must have had treatment with a dose of 1 mg/kg agalsidase beta per infusion every two weeks for at least one year. In addition, to be included in the trial, patients need to have certain eGFR values and a meaningful decline in annualize eGFR slope.
 
 8

 

The primary endpoint for the BALANCE study, which was agreed with both the FDA and the EMA, is the comparison in the rate of decline of eGFR slope between Fabrazyme and PRX 102. At 12 months, we intend to conduct an interim analysis to test for non-inferiority to support an anticipated regulatory filing with the EMA. Patients enrolled in the study will continue to be treated for a total of 24 months, at which point the data will be analyzed to test for superiority to support an FDA filing.
 
In addition, we are preparing for a supportive phase III clinical trial of PRX-102, which shall be run at the same time as the BALANCE Study. This supportive study, which we refer to as the BRIDGE Study, is designed to be an open-label, single-arm, switchover study to assess the efficacy and safety of PRX-102 in Fabry patients currently treated with Replagal. We expect to enroll 22 patients in the BRIDGE Study during 2017. The objective of the study is to generate safety and efficacy data of patients switched from Replagal to PRX-102 over a 12-month period, with interim results at six months. The endpoints of the study are safety, mean annualized change (slope) in eGFR, pain, plasma lyso GB3, immunogenicity and Quality of Life.
 
In February 2015, we announced the completion of enrollment in our phase I/II clinical trial in adult Fabry patients. The phase I/II clinical trial is a worldwide, multi-center, open label, dose ranging study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and efficacy parameters of PRX-102 in adult Fabry patients. Sixteen adult Fabry patients (9 male and 7 female) completed the trial, each in one of three dosing groups, 0.2 mg/kg, 1mg/kg and 2mg/kg. Each patient received intravenous infusions of PRX-102 every two weeks for 12 weeks, with efficacy follow-up after six-month and twelve-month periods. All patients that completed the trial have opted to continue to receive 1 mg/kg of PRX-102 in an open-label extension trial, 60-month extension study under which all patients have been switched to receive 1 mg/kg of the drug, the selected dose for our phase III studies of PRX-102.
 
Phase I/II Clinical Data; Efficacy Results:
 
Improvements or stabilization in efficacy parameters were demonstrated across all disease parameters. Stable kidney function was observed in the trial, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), with mean change from mean eGFR value of 110.78 at base-line to 110.23 after 12 months for all patients, and from mean eGFR value of 117.37 to 117.36 for Classic Fabry patients. The eGFR slope for all patients (n=16) using CKD-EPI was -2.9 (BL-77.7-156.3). The eGFR slope for Classic Fabry patients (n=10) was -1.8 (BL 82.4-156.3). According to a published report, an annualized rate of eGFR change of -3.8 (BL 49-170) was observed in a study of the effect of Fabrazymeon the Classic Fabry patient population using CKD-EPI analysis with similar base line of eGFR. All patients had stable cardiac function as measured by left ventricular mass (LVM) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI), via MRI. After one year of treatment, average reduction of plasma Lyso-Gb3 were 48.9% in all patients and 57.6% in Classic Fabry patients. Similarly, levels after one year of treatment, average reductions in plasma Gb3 were 22.2% in all patients, and 33.3% in Classic patients.
 
The detailed results, as a percentage of change from baseline, for both all patients and for the Classic Fabry disease patient subset are presented in the following chart:
 

% change ±SE | eGFR | LVM | LVMI | Plasma Gb3 | Plasma lyso-Gb3
------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-------------+----------------
All Patients (n=16) | -0.5 ±2.1 | -0.0 ±2.5 | 0.4 ±2.6 | -22.2 ± 6.1 | -48.9 ± 5.7 
Classic Patients (n=10) | -0.1±2.2 | -2.6 ±3.4 | -3.1 ±3.1 | -33.3 ± 7.6 | -57.6 ± 6.8 

 
Based on an analysis of kidney biopsies with randomized blinded scoring, PRX-102 demonstrated a major reduction from baseline in renal peritubular capillary Gb3 using the quantitative Barisoni Lipid Inclusion Scoring System (BLISS). Patients in the 1 mg/kg dosing cohort of the trial showed an 86.5% reduction in Gb3 inclusion after six months (n=4); this data represents an 89.6% reduction for males (n=3) and a 77.3% reduction for females (n=1).
 
With respect to safety, PRX-102 was found to be safe and well tolerated, with a majority of adverse events being mild and moderate in severity with very limited formation of antibodies, which all seroconvert to be antibody negative after 12 months of treatment.

Phase I/II Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity: 
 
The study results showed improved stability and prolonged exposure to the enzyme, which we believe is the result of the PEGylation and cross linking we made to the enzyme. PRX-102 has been shown in clinical trials to have a half-life of approximately 80 hours and a substantially higher AUC compared to the other ERTs, demonstrating enzyme availability throughout the 2-week infusion intervals. This unique enzyme parameter of PRX-102 demonstrated the potential for reduced immunogenicity and induction of immune tolerance.
 
The data demonstrated a low incidence of treatment induced anti-drug antibodies, or ADA. Three of the 16 patients treated developed ADA, which turned to be negative after 12 months of treatment.
 
In summary, in the phase I/II trial, PRX-102 was found to have a markedly extended circulatory half-life compared with other ERTs; it demonstrated a low incidence of treatment induced ADA with reversible and transient effect on pharmacokinetics; ADA response was transient and tolerization was observed; and ADA positivity had no observed impact on safety and efficacy.
 
alidornase Alfa (PRX-110) for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis 
 
alidornase alfa is our proprietary plant cell recombinant form of human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) that we are developing for the treatment of CF, to be administered by inhalation. DNase I cleaves extracellular DNA and thins the thick mucus that accumulates in the lungs of CF patients. Currently, Pulmozyme® is the only DNase I commercially available, with annual sales of approximately CHF 685 million (approximately $671 million) in sales for 2016 according to public reports by F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd.
 
In vitro studies with PRX-110 demonstrated improved enzyme kinetics, significantly reduced sensitivity to inhibition by actin and improved ex vivo efficacy when compared to Pulmozyme. Preclinical studies of PRX-110 administered by inhalation showed substantial enzymatic activity in lungs.
 
We designed alidornase alfa, through chemical modification, to be resistant to inhibition by actin so as to improve lung function and lower the incidence of recurrent infections by enhancing the enzyme’s efficacy in patients’ sputa. Actin, a potent inhibitor of DNase, is found in high concentration in CF patients’ sputum. As demonstrated in Figure 1, the activity of alidornase alfa, as demonstrated in in vitro studies, remains almost with no change in the relevant actin concentration found in CF patients while Pulmozyme is degraded significantly.

In addition, alidornase alfa has demonstrated improved disease parameters in human models sputum testing when compared to the currently marketed product. In particular, alidornase alfa has demonstrated a reduction in mucus viscosity in human sputum samples when compared to the currently marketed product. See Figure 1.
 
alidornase alfa Development Program
 
We completed a phase I clinical trial of alidornase alfa with 18 healthy volunteers in which alidornase alfa was found to be safe and tolerable.
 
In July 2016 we commenced a phase IIa clinical trial of alidornase alfa. The trial is a 28-day switch-over study of 15 CF patients previously treated with Pulmozyme to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alidornase alfa in CF patients. Participation in the trial is preceded by a two-week washout period from Pulmozyme before treatment with alidornase alfa via inhalation. The main efficacy endpoint is the change of forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Additional endpoints include safety and tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic data.
 
In January 2017, we announced positive interim results from the phase IIa clinical trial for the first 13 CF patients enrolled in the study. At that time, 15 patients had been enrolled in, and were expected to complete, the study. The initial primary efficacy result shows that alidornase alfa improves lung function as demonstrated by a mean absolute increase in the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) of 4.1 points from baseline and 3.1 points from last treatment of Pulmozyme. A commercially available small molecule CFTR modulator for the treatment of CF has reported a mean absolute increase in ppFEV1 of 2.5 from baseline in its registration clinical study. This score was achieved while 74% of the patients participating in the trial of the CFTR modulator were also treated with Pulmozyme on top of the modulator. While this marketed CFTR addresses a certain mutation applicable to less than 50% of CF patients, we are developing alidornase alfa to treat all CF patients.
 
Sputa available DNA samples were analyzed for approximately half of the patients in the phase II trial. A mean reduction of approximately 60% in DNA content from baseline was observed, and a mean reduction of approximately 90% from baseline was observed for sputa visco-elasticity. This data provides further supportive evidence of improved lung function after treatment with alidornase alfa, as demonstrated by the increase in ppFEV1. See Figure 2.

No serious adverse events were reported, and all adverse events that occurred during the study were mild and transient in nature.
 
OPRX-106; Oral antiTNF for the treatment of inflammatory diseases
 
OPRX-106, our oral antiTNF product candidate, is a recombinant antiTNF (Tumor, Necrosis Factor) protein that we are expressing through ProCellEx. Auto-immune-mediated inflammatory disorders are conditions that are characterized by common pathways that lead to inflammation and are caused or triggered by a compromised or dysregulation of the normal immune response. Immune-mediated inflammatory disorders can cause organ damage, and are associated with increased morbidity. Common auto-immune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease, psoriasis, and others. Some of the major treatments are antiTNF drugs, administered as subcutaneous injections or as intravenous infusions. Sales of anti-TNF drugs exceeded $30 billion annually. Well-known antiTNF drugs include Humira, Remicade and Enbrel.
 
OPRX-106 is a plant cell-expressed form of the fused protein that is naturally encapsulated within BY-2 cells genetically engineered to express the enzyme. Plant cells have the unique attribute of a cellulose cell wall which makes them resistant to enzyme degradation when passing through the digestive tract. The plant cell itself serves as a delivery vehicle, once released and absorbed, to transport the enzyme in active form to the bloodstream. If proven effective, our experimental oral antiTNF would be the first protein to be administered orally rather than through injection. We believe that our oral delivery mechanism could be applied to additional proteins and has the potential to change the method of protein administration in certain indications.
 
We are developing oral antiTNF an orally-administered anti-inflammatory treatment using plant cells as a natural capsule for the expressed protein. In preclinical studies, oral PRX-106 alleviated immune-mediated hepatitis and reduced interferon gamma levels in a concanavalin A (ConA) inflammatory mouse model. Furthermore, the drug was shown to alleviate liver damage and reduce liver necrosis and liver enzymes, ALT and AST, thus leading to an improvement in liver biopsies. In a high fat diet model (NASH), OPRX-106 demonstrated a reduction of liver enzymes, ALT and AST, reduction of serum triglycerides, along with a trend for reduction of liver fat. Additionally, oral administration of OPRX-106 alleviated immune mediated colitis in a well-established mouse model, promoting serum levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and regulatory T-cells.
 
pr-antiTNF is a plant cell-expressed recombinant fusion protein made from the binding domain of the human TNF receptor (TNFR), fused to the Fc component of a human antibody domain. It has an identical amino acid sequence to Enbrel and our in vitro and preclinical animal studies have demonstrated that pr-antiTNF exhibits similar or better activity to Enbrel. See Figure 3.

OPRX-106 Development Program
 
We have concluded a phase I clinical trial of OPRX-106, which demonstrated that the drug was safe and well tolerated, showing biological activity in the gut. The phase I clinical trial was a randomized, parallel-design, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of OPRX-106 in healthy volunteers. The trial enrolled 14 subjects that were randomized to one of three dosing cohorts receiving OPRX-106 doses equivalent to 2mg, 8mg or 16mg Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor-Fc fusion protein. Subjects received once daily oral administrations for five consecutive days. The results demonstrated that oral administration of OPRX-106 is safe and well tolerated. No major side effects were noted, and no suppression of the immune system was observed. Regulatory T cell activation showing biological activity in the gut was observed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS) was performed using various antibodies for surface markers, and it was observed that all three dosages of OPRX-106 promoted the induction of various subsets of T cells, some of which are correlated with anti-inflammatory response.
 
In November 2016, the first patient was enrolled in our phase IIa clinical trial of OPRX-106 for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The phase IIa clinical trial is designed as a randomized, open label, 2-arm study of OPRX-106 in 20 patients with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Patients will be randomized to receive 2 mg or 8 mg of OPRX-106 administered orally, once daily, for eight weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is safety, including monitoring for adverse events following daily administration of the drug. Key efficacy endpoints include relevant disease parameters of the drug, including Mayo score and rectal bleeding.
 
Technology Transfer Agreement with Fiocruz
 
We entered into the Brazil Agreement with Fiocruz in June 2013, which became effective in January 2014. The technology transfer is designed to be completed in four stages and is intended to transfer to Fiocruz the capacity and skills required for the Brazilian government to construct its own manufacturing facility, at its sole expense, and to produce a sustainable, high-quality, and cost-effective supply of taliglucerase alfa. The initial term of the technology transfer is seven years. The agreement contains certain purchase commitments by Fiocruz. If Fiocruz fails to comply with the purchase commitments, we may terminate the agreement, and all of our rights to the technology will be returned.
 
In December 2016, we received a letter from Fiocruz regarding an order from the Brazilian MoH to purchase alfataliglicerase to treat Gaucher patients in Brazil. The Brazilian MoH’s order consists of a number of shipments during 2017 for a total of approximately $24.3 million. Shipments are to start in mid-2017 and continue through the end of the year, in increasing volumes. Since the agreement went into effect, Fiocruz’s purchases of taliglucerase alfa have been significantly below the agreed upon purchase milestones and, accordingly, we have the right to terminate the Brazil Agreement. Notwithstanding the low purchase amounts, we are, at this time, continuing to supply Uplyso to Fiocruz under the Brazil Agreement, and patients continue to be treated with Uplyso in Brazil. We are discussing with Fiocruz potential actions that Fiocruz may take to comply with its purchase obligations and, based on such discussions, we will determine what we believe to be the course of action that is in the best interest of our company.
 
The Brazil Agreement may be extended for an additional five-year term, as needed, to complete the technology transfer. All of the terms of the arrangement, including the minimum annual purchases, will apply during the additional term. Upon completion of the technology transfer, and subject to Fiocruz receiving approval from ANVISA to manufacture taliglucerase alfa in its facility in Brazil, the agreement will enter into the final term and will remain in effect until our last patent in Brazil expires. During such period, Fiocruz will be the sole provider of this important treatment option for Gaucher patients in Brazil and shall pay us a single-digit royalty on net sales.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We maintain a proactive intellectual property strategy which includes patent filings in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States and other commercially significant markets. As of December 31, 2016, we held, or had license rights to, 61 patents and 58 pending patent applications with respect to various compositions, methods of production and methods of use relating to our ProCellEx protein expression system and our proprietary product pipeline. Of the above, one is a joint patent, eight are joint patent applications, and one is a licensed patent application.
 
Our competitive position and future success depend in part on our ability, and that of our licensees, to obtain and leverage the intellectual property covering our product candidates, know-how, methods, processes and other technologies, to protect our trade secrets, to prevent others from using our intellectual property and to operate without infringing the intellectual property of third parties. We seek to protect our competitive position by filing United States, European Union, Israeli and other foreign patent applications covering our technology, including both new technology and improvements to existing technology. Our patent strategy includes obtaining patents, where possible, on methods of production, compositions of matter and methods of use. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation, licensing and partnership opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are aware of U.S. patents, and corresponding international counterparts of such patents, owned by third parties that contain claims covering methods of producing GCD. We do not believe that, if any claim of infringement were to be asserted against us based upon such patents, taliglucerase alfa would be found to infringe any valid claim under such patents. However, there can be no assurance that a court would find in our favor or that, if we choose or are required to seek a license to any one or more of such patents, a license would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
 
In April 2005, Protalix Ltd. entered into a license agreement with Icon Genetics AG, or Icon, pursuant to which we received an exclusive worldwide license to develop, test, use and commercialize Icon’s technology to express certain proteins in our ProCellEx protein expression system. We are also entitled to a non-exclusive worldwide license to make and have made other proteins expressed by using Icon’s technology in our technology. As consideration for the license, we are obligated to make royalty payments equal to varying low, single-digit percentages of net sales of products by us, our affiliates, or any sublicensees under the agreement. In addition, we are obligated to make milestone payments equal to $350,000, in the aggregate, for each product developed under the license, upon the achievement of certain milestones.
 
Our license agreement with Icon remains in effect until the earlier of the expiration of the last patent under the agreement or, if all of the patents under the agreement expire, 20 years after the first commercial sale of any product under the agreement. Icon may terminate the agreement upon written notice to us that we are in material breach of our obligations under the agreement and we are unable to remedy such material breach within 30 days after we receive such notice. Further, Icon may terminate the agreement in connection with certain events relating to a wind up or bankruptcy, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors, or if we cease to conduct operations for a certain period. Icon may also terminate the exclusivity granted to us by written notice if we fail to reach certain milestones within a designated period of time. Notwithstanding the termination date of the agreement, our obligation to pay royalties to Icon under the agreement may expire prior to the termination of the agreement, subject to certain conditions.
 
Manufacturing
 
We are obligated to manufacture all of the taliglucerase alfa drug product needed under the Amended Pfizer Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions. Our drug product candidates, as well as taliglucerase alfa, must be manufactured in a sterile environment and in compliance with cGMPs set by the FDA and other relevant foreign regulatory authorities. We use our current facility, which has approximately 20,000 sq/ft of clean rooms built according to industry standards, to develop, process and manufacture taliglucerase alfa and other recombinant proteins. We intend to use our current manufacturing space to produce all of the taliglucerase alfa we need in the near future, included the taliglucerase alfa to be purchased by Pfizer. In addition, we intend to use our manufacturing space to produce all of the drug substance needed in connection with the clinical trials for our product candidates.
 
In addition, we are currently producing Fabry drug substance for our phase III clinical trial as part of the process of converting our current approved manufacturing facility to an approved multi-product facility, thereby introducing potentially significant operational savings. Our facility’s current capacity can serve all of our current and expected commercial and clinical needs, and we believe it will be sufficient to serve our production needs for the anticipated commercialization of PRX-102.
 
Our manufacturing facilities in Carmiel, Israel, have undergone successful audits by the Israeli MOH, the FDA, ANVISA, and the European Union under the European Union’s centralized marketing authorization procedure, the Australian TGA and Health Canada.

Our current facility in Israel has been granted “Approved Enterprise” status, and we have elected to participate in the alternative benefits program. Our facility is located in a Zone A location, and, therefore, our income from the Approved Enterprise will be tax exempt in Israel for a 10-year period commencing with the year in which we first generate taxable income from the relevant Approved Enterprise and after we use our net operating loss carryforwards, or “NOLs.” We expect to be entitled to similar tax benefits for a number of years thereafter. To remain eligible for these tax benefits, we must continue to meet certain conditions, and if we increase our activities outside of Israel, for example, by future acquisitions, such increased activities generally may not be eligible for inclusion in Israeli tax benefit programs. In addition, our technology is subject to certain restrictions with respect to the transfer of technology and manufacturing rights. “See Risk Factors—The manufacture of our products is an exacting and complex process, and if we or one of our materials suppliers encounter problems manufacturing our products, it will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”
 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
We believe that the raw materials that we require throughout the manufacturing process of Elelyso, PRX-102, alidornase alfa and OPRX-106 and our other current and potential drug product candidates are widely available from numerous suppliers and are generally considered to be generic industrial biological supplies. We rely on a single approved supplier for certain materials relating to the current expression of our proprietary biotherapeutic proteins through ProCellEx. We have identified additional suppliers for most of the materials required for the production of our product candidates.
 
Development and regulatory approval of our pharmaceutical products are dependent upon our ability to procure active ingredients and certain packaging materials from sources approved by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Since the FDA and other regulatory approval processes require manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications, FDA approval of a supplemental application to use a new supplier in connection with any drug candidate or approved product, if any, would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier, which could result in manufacturing delays. From time to time, we intend to continue to identify alternative FDA-approved suppliers to ensure the continued supply of necessary raw materials.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and significant competition. Competition from numerous existing companies and others entering the fields in which we operate is intense and expected to increase. Most of these companies have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, technological personnel and managerial resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with our current and future product candidates and technologies. Acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies could further enhance such competitors’ financial, marketing and other resources. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize competitive products or technologies on their own or through collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
 
There are two approved ERTs for the treatment of Fabry disease; Fabrazyme which is marketed by Genzyme and Replagal, which is marketed by Shire. Fabrazyme is available in the United States and the European Union. Replagal is available in the European Union. In addition, we are aware of other late clinical stage, early clinical stage and experimental drugs which are being developed for the treatment of Fabry disease by Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. and other companies. In addition, in May 2016, Galafold™ (migalastat), an oral small molecule pharmacological chaperone marketed by Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. was approved as a first line therapy for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and who have an amenable mutation.
 
With respect to alidornase alfa, we face competition from Genentech Inc., a member of the Roche Group, which markets Pulmozyme.
 
With respect to PRX-106, we face competition from AbbVie Inc. (Humira®), Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co. (Remicade) and Pfizer and Amgen Inc. (Enbrel). In addition, we are aware of other clinical stage, early clinical stage and experimental antiTNF drugs.
 
 16

 

We also face competition from companies that are developing other platforms for the expression of recombinant therapeutic pharmaceuticals. We are aware of companies that are developing alternative technologies to develop and produce therapeutic proteins in anticipation of the expiration of certain patent claims covering marketed proteins. Competitors developing alternative expression technologies include Crucell N.V. (which was acquired by Johnson & Johnson during 2010), Shire and GlycoFi, Inc. (which was acquired by Merck & Co. Inc.). Other companies are developing alternate plant-based technologies, include, among others, iBio, Inc., Medicago Inc., and Greenovation Biotech GmbH, none of which are cell-based. Rather, such companies base their product development on transgenic plants or whole plants.
 
See “Risk Factors—Developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
 
Scientific Advisory Board
 
We have reorganized our scientific advisory board by establishing a core team of advisors. The scientific advisory board may invite additional experts to attend meetings on a case-by-case basis. Members of our scientific advisory board consult with our management within their professional areas of expertise; exchange strategic and business development ideas with our management; attend scientific, medical and business meetings with our management, such as meetings with the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, meetings with strategic or potential strategic partners and other meetings relevant to their areas of expertise; and attend meetings of our scientific advisory board. We expect our scientific advisory board to convene at least twice annually, and we frequently consult with the individual members of our scientific advisory board. Our scientific advisory board currently includes the following people:

Government Regulation
 
The testing, manufacture, distribution, advertising and marketing of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by similar authorities in other countries. Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country.
 
The regulatory process, which includes overseeing preclinical studies and clinical trials of each pharmaceutical compound to establish its safety and efficacy and confirmation by the FDA that good laboratory, clinical and manufacturing practices were maintained during testing and manufacturing, can take many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and gives larger companies with greater financial resources a competitive advantage over us. Delays or terminations of clinical trials that we undertake would likely impair our development of product candidates. Delays or terminations could result from a number of factors, including stringent enrollment criteria, slow rate of enrollment, size of patient population, having to compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, geographical considerations and others.
 
The FDA review process can be lengthy and unpredictable, and we may encounter delays or rejections of our applications when submitted. Generally, in order to gain FDA approval, we must first conduct preclinical studies in a laboratory and in animal models to obtain preliminary information on a compound and to identify any potential safety problems. The results of these studies are submitted as part of an IND application that the FDA must review before human clinical trials of an investigational drug can commence. Clinical trials may be terminated by the clinical trial site, sponsor or the FDA if toxicities appear that are either worse than expected or unexpected.
 
Clinical trials are normally performed in three sequential phases and generally take two to five years, or longer, to complete. Phase I consists of testing the drug product in a small number of humans, normally healthy volunteers, to determine preliminary safety and tolerable dose range. Phase II usually involves studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug product in humans having the disease or medical condition for which the product is indicated, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and identify possible common adverse effects and safety risks. Phase III consists of additional controlled testing at multiple clinical sites to establish clinical safety and effectiveness in an expanded patient population of geographically dispersed test sites to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship for administering the product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Phase IV clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
 
After completion of clinical trials of a new drug product, FDA and foreign regulatory authority marketing approval must be obtained. Assuming that the clinical data support the product’s safety and effectiveness for its intended use, a new drug application, or NDA, or a BLA is submitted to the FDA for review. Generally, it takes one to three years to obtain approval. If questions arise during the FDA review process, approval may take a significantly longer period of time. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and approval on a timely basis, if at all, or the approval that we receive may be for a narrower indication than we had originally sought, potentially undermining the commercial viability of the product. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, approved products are subject to continual review and holders of an approved product are required, for example, to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for the product. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures relating to a product must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to comply with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. The later discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements with respect to any product may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.

Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs and biological products intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs that may provide a significant therapeutic advantage over existing treatments and target conditions affecting 200,000 or fewer U.S. patients per year. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are possible funding and tax savings to support clinical trials and for other financial incentives and a waiver of the marketing application user fee and most likely priority review. If a significant therapeutic advantage over existing treatments is shown in the marketing application, the FDA may grant orphan drug approval and provide a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity.
 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review on a rolling basis sections of the NDA or BLA before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA as they become available and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. We used the rolling submission option for our taliglucerase alfa NDA, which we completed in April 2010.
 
The United States federal government regulates healthcare through various agencies, including but not limited to the following: (i) the FDA, which administers the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), as well as other relevant laws; (ii) the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (iii) the Office of Inspector General (OIG) which enforces various laws aimed at curtailing fraudulent or abusive practices, including by way of example, the Anti-Kickback Law, the Anti-Physician Referral Law, commonly referred to as Stark, the Anti-Inducement Law, the Civil Money Penalty Law and the laws that authorize the OIG to exclude healthcare providers and others from participating in federal healthcare programs; and (iv) the Office of Civil Rights, which administers the privacy aspects of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. All of the aforementioned are agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Healthcare is also provided or regulated, as the case may be, by the Department of Defense through its TriCare program, the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially through the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, the Public Health Service within HHS under Public Health Service Act § 340B (42 U.S.C. § 256b), the Department of Justice through the Federal False Claims Act and various criminal statutes, and state governments under the Medicaid and other state sponsored or funded programs and their internal laws regulating all healthcare activities. Many states also have anti-kickback and anti-physician referral laws that are similar to the federal laws, but may be applicable in situations where federal laws do not apply.
 
Medicare is the federal healthcare program for those who are (i) over 65 years of age, (ii) disabled, (iii) suffering from end-stage renal disease or (iv) suffering from Lou Gehrig’s disease. Medicare consists of part A, which covers inpatient costs, part B, which covers services by physicians and laboratories, durable medical equipment and certain drugs, primarily those administered by physicians, and part D, which provides drug coverage for most prescription drugs other than those covered under part B. Medicare also offers a managed care option under part C. Medicare is administered by CMS. In contrast, Medicaid is a state-federal healthcare program for the poor and is administered by the states pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Most state Medicaid programs cover most outpatient prescription drugs.
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, PPACA, became law in the United States. PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. Key provisions of PPACA specific to the pharmaceutical industry, among others, include the following:
 

· | An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents into the United States, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain federal government healthcare programs (excluding sales of any drug or biologic product marketed for an orphan indication), beginning in 2011;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 19

 


· | An increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D, beginning in 2011;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, effective March 23, 2010;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in April 2010 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level beginning in 2014, thereby potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program, effective January 2010;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | New requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and others, including reporting any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers and reporting any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during each calendar year beginning in 2012, with reporting starting in 2013;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians, effective April 1, 2012;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

International Regulation
 
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
 
Pharmaceutical products may not be imported into, or manufactured or marketed in, the State of Israel absent drug registration. The three basic criteria for the registration of pharmaceuticals in Israel is quality, safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and the Israeli MOH requires pharmaceutical companies to conform to international developments and standards. Regulatory requirements are constantly changing in accordance with scientific advances as well as social and ethical values.
 
The relevant legislation of the European Union requires that medicinal products, including generic versions of previously approved products, and new strengths, dosage forms and formulations, of previously approved products, shall have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the European Union. Authorizations are granted after the assessment of quality, safety and efficacy by the respective health authorities. In order to obtain an authorization, an application must be made to the competent authority of the member state concerned or in a centralized procedure to the EMA. Besides various formal requirements, the application must contain the results of pharmaceutical (physico-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests, of preclinical (toxicological and pharmacological) tests as well as of clinical trials. All of these tests must have been conducted in accordance with relevant EU regulations and must allow the reviewer to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product. Orphan drug designation in the European Union is granted to medicinal products intended for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases and very serious conditions that affect not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. Orphan drug designation is generally given to medicinal products that treat conditions for which no current therapy exists or are expected to bring a significant benefit to patients over existing therapies.

Israeli Government Programs
 
The following is a summary of the current principal Israeli tax laws applicable to us and Protalix Ltd., and of the Israeli Government programs from which Protalix Ltd. benefits. Some parts of this discussion are based on new tax legislation that has not been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation. Therefore, the views expressed in the discussion may not be accepted by the tax authorities in question. The discussion should not be construed as legal or professional tax advice and does not cover all possible tax considerations.
General Corporate Tax Structure in Israel
 
The income of Protalix Ltd., other than income from “Approved Enterprises,” is taxed in Israel at the regular rates which were 26.5% for fiscal years 2014 through 2015, and 25% in 2016.
 
In January 2016, the Law for the Amendment of the Income Tax Ordinance (No. 216) was published, enacting a reduction of corporate tax rate beginning in 2016 and thereafter, from 26.5% to 25%. In December 2016, the Economic Efficiency Law (Legislative Amendments for Implementing the Economic Policy for the 2017 and 2018 Budget Year), 2016 was published, introducing a gradual reduction in corporate tax rate from 25% to 23%. However, the law also included a temporary provision setting the corporate tax rate in 2017 at 24%. As a result, the corporate tax rate will be 24% in 2017 and 23% in 2018 and thereafter.
 
Capital gains on the sale of assets are subject to capital gains tax according to the corporate tax rate in effect in the year which the assets are sold.
 
Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959
 
The Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, as amended or the Investment Law, provides certain incentives for capital investments in a production facility (or other eligible assets). Generally, an investment program that is implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law, referred to as an “Approved Enterprise,” is entitled to benefits. These benefits may include cash grants from the Israeli government and tax benefits, based upon, among other things, the location of the facility in which the investment is made and specific elections made by the grantee. See also Note 10.
 
Protalix Ltd. will continue to enjoy the tax benefits under the pre-revision provisions of the Investment Law. If any new benefits are granted to Protalix Ltd. in the future, Protalix Ltd. will be subject to the provisions of the amended Investment Law with respect to these new benefits. Therefore, the following discussion is a summary of the Investment Law prior to its amendment as well as the relevant changes contained in the new legislation.
 
Under the Investment Law prior to its amendment, a company that wished to receive benefits had to receive approval from the Authority for the Investment and Development of the Industry and Economy, or the Authority. Each certificate of approval for an Approved Enterprise relates to a specific investment program in the Approved Enterprise, delineated both by the financial scope of the investment and by the physical characteristics of the facility or the asset, e.g., the equipment to be purchased and utilized pursuant to the program.
 
An Approved Enterprise may elect to forego any entitlement to the grants otherwise available under the Investment Law and, instead, participate in an alternative benefits program under which the undistributed income from the Approved Enterprise is fully exempt from corporate tax for a defined period of time. Under the alternative package of benefits, a company’s undistributed income derived from an Approved Enterprise will be exempt from corporate tax for a period of between two and 10 years from the first year of taxable income, depending upon the geographic location within Israel of the Approved Enterprise. Upon expiration of the exemption period, the Approved Enterprise is eligible for the reduced tax rates otherwise applicable under the Investment Law for any remainder of the otherwise applicable benefits period (up to an aggregate benefits period of either seven or 10 years, depending on the location of the company or its definition as a foreign investors’ company). If a company has more than one Approved Enterprise program or if only a portion of its capital investments are approved, its effective tax rate is the result of a weighted combination of the applicable rates. The tax benefits from any certificate of approval relate only to taxable profits attributable to the specific Approved Enterprise. Income from activity that is derived from different Approved Enterprises does not enjoy these tax benefits.
 
 21

 

A company that has an Approved Enterprise program is eligible for further tax benefits if it qualifies as a foreign investors’ company. A foreign investors’ company eligible for benefits is essentially a company in which more than 25% of the share capital (in terms of shares, rights to profit, voting and appointment of directors) is owned (measured by both share capital and combined share and loan capital) by non-Israeli residents. A company that qualifies as a foreign investors’ company and has an Approved Enterprise program is eligible for tax benefits for a 10-year benefit period and may enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 10% to 25%, depending on the amount of the company’s shares held by non-Israeli shareholders.
 
If a company that has an Approved Enterprise program is a wholly owned subsidiary of another company, the percentage of foreign investments is determined based on the percentage of foreign investment in the parent company. The tax rates and related levels of foreign investments are set forth in the following table:
 

Percent of Foreign Ownership | Rate of Reduced Tax 
------------------------------+---------------------
0-49% | | 25%
49-74% | | 20%
74-90% | | 15%
90-100% | | 10%

 
Our original facility in Israel has been granted “Approved Enterprise” status, and it has elected to participate in the alternative benefits program. Under the terms of its Approved Enterprise program, the facility is located in a top priority location, or “Zone A,” and, therefore, the income from that Approved Enterprise will be tax exempt in Israel for a period of 10 years, commencing with the year in which taxable income is first generated from the relevant Approved Enterprise. The current benefits program may not continue to be available and Protalix Ltd. may not continue to qualify for its benefits.
 
A company that has elected to participate in the alternative benefits program and that subsequently pays a dividend out of the income derived from the Approved Enterprise during the tax exemption period will be subject to corporate tax in respect of the amount distributed at the rate that would have been applicable had the company not elected the alternative benefits program (generally 10% to 25%, depending on the extent to which non-Israeli shareholders hold such company’s shares). If the dividend is distributed within 12 years after the commencement of the benefits period (or, in the case of a foreign investor’s company, without time limitation), the dividend recipient is taxed at the reduced withholding tax rate of 15% applicable to dividends from approved enterprises, or at the lower rate under an applicable tax treaty. After this period, the withholding tax rate is 25%, or at the lower rate under an applicable tax treaty. In the case of a company with a foreign investment level (as defined by the Investment Law) of 25% or more, the 12-year limitation on reduced withholding tax on dividends does not apply. The company must withhold this tax at its source, regardless of whether the dividend is converted into foreign currency.
 
The Investment Law also provides that an Approved Enterprise is entitled to accelerated depreciation on its property and equipment that are included in an approved investment program. This benefit is an incentive granted by the Israeli government regardless of whether the alternative benefits program is elected.
 
The benefits available to an Approved Enterprise are conditioned upon terms stipulated in the Investment Law and regulations and the criteria set forth in the applicable certificate of approval. If Protalix Ltd. does not fulfill these conditions in whole or in part, the benefits can be canceled and Protalix Ltd. may be required to refund the received benefits, linked to the Israeli consumer price index with the addition of interest or alternatively with an additional penalty payment. We believe that Protalix Ltd. currently operates in compliance with all applicable conditions and criteria, but there can be no assurance that Protalix Ltd. will continue to do so. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any Approved Enterprise status granted to Protalix Ltd.’s facilities will entitle Protalix Ltd. to the same benefits to which it is currently entitled.
 
Under the Investment Law, the approval of the Authority is required only for Approved Enterprises that receive cash grants. Approved Enterprises that do not receive benefits in the form of governmental cash grants, but only tax benefits, are no longer required to obtain this approval. Instead, these Approved Enterprises are required to make certain investments as specified in the Investment Law.
 
The amended Investment Law specifies certain conditions for an Approved Enterprise to be entitled to benefits. These conditions include:
 

· | the Approved Enterprise’s revenues from any single country or a separate customs territory may not exceed 75% of the Approved Enterprise’s total revenues; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 22

 


· | at least 25% of the Approved Enterprise’s revenues during the benefits period must be derived from sales into a single country or a separate customs territory with a population of at least 14 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There can be no assurance that Protalix Ltd. will comply with the above conditions in the future or that Protalix Ltd. will be entitled to any additional benefits under the Investment Law. In addition, it is possible that Protalix Ltd. may not be able to operate in a manner that maximizes utilization of the potential benefits available under the Investment Law.
 
From time to time, the Israeli Government has considered reducing the benefits available to companies under the Investment Law. The termination or substantial reduction of any of the benefits available under the Investment Law could materially impact the cost of our future investments.
 
Encouragement of Industrial Research, Development and Technology Innovation Law, 1984
 
To date, Protalix Ltd. has received grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist, or the OCS, under the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Industrial Research, Development and Technology Innovation, 1984, and related regulations, or the Research Law. On January 1, 2016, the Israeli government established the National Authority for Technological Innovation, or NATI. NATI has replaced many of the functions of the OCS. For purposes of clarity, references to NATI will include the OCS. NATI grants are made available to finance of a portion of Protalix Ltd.’s research and development expenditures in Israel. As of December 31, 2016, NATI approved grants in respect of Protalix Ltd.’s continuing operations totaling approximately $46.6 million, measured from inception. Protalix Ltd. is required to repay up to 100% of grants actually received (plus interest at the LIBOR rate applied to the grants received on or after January 1, 1999) to NATI through payments of royalties at a rate of 3% to 6% of the revenues generated from NATI-funded project, depending on the period in which revenues were generated. As of December 31, 2016, Protalix Ltd. either paid or accrued royalties payable of $8.1◦million and Protalix Ltd.’s contingent liability to NATI with respect to grants received was approximately $38.5◦million.
 
Under the Research Law, recipients of grants from NATI are prohibited from manufacturing products developed using these grants outside of the State of Israel without special approvals, although the Research Law does enable companies to seek prior approval for conducting manufacturing activities outside of Israel without being subject to increased royalties. If Protalix Ltd. receives approval to manufacture the products developed with government grants outside of Israel, it will be required to pay an increased total amount of royalties (possibly up to 300% of the grant amounts plus interest), depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside of Israel, as well as at a possibly increased royalty rate.
 
Additionally, under the Research Law, Protalix Ltd. is prohibited from transferring NATI-financed technologies and related intellectual property rights outside of the State of Israel, except under limited circumstances and only with the approval of NATI Council or the Research Committee. Protalix Ltd. may not receive the required approvals for any proposed transfer and, if received, Protalix Ltd. may be required to pay NATI a portion of the consideration that it receives upon any sale of such technology by a non-Israeli entity. The scope of the support received, the royalties that Protalix Ltd. has already paid to NATI, the amount of time that has elapsed between the date on which the know-how was transferred and the date on which NATI grants were received and the sale price and the form of transaction will be taken into account in order to calculate the amount of the payment to NATI. Approval of the transfer of technology to residents of the State of Israel is required, and may be granted in specific circumstances only if the recipient abides by the provisions of applicable laws, including the restrictions on the transfer of know-how and the obligation to pay royalties. No assurance can be made that approval to any such transfer, if requested, will be granted.
 
Under the Research Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder, NATI Council may allow the transfer outside of Israel of know-how derived from an approved program and the related manufacturing rights in limited circumstances which are currently as follows:
 

· | in the event of a sale of know-how itself to a non-affiliated third party, provided that upon such sale the owner of the know-how pays to NATI an amount, in cash, as set forth in the Research Law (and the regulations promulgated thereunder). In addition, the amendment provides that if the purchaser of the know-how gives the selling Israeli company the right to exploit the know-how by way of an exclusive, irrevocable and unlimited license, the research committee may approve such transfer in special cases without requiring a cash payment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in the event of a sale of a company which is the owner of know-how, pursuant to which the company ceases to be an Israeli company, provided that upon such sale, the owner of the know-how makes a cash payment to NATI as set forth in the Research Law (and the regulations promulgated thereunder).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 23

 


· | in the event of an exchange of know-how such that in exchange for the transfer of know-how outside of Israel, the recipient of the know-how transfers other know-how to the company in Israel in a manner in which NATI is convinced that the Israeli economy realizes a greater, overall benefit from the exchange of know-how.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Research Committee may, in special cases, approve the transfer of manufacture or of manufacturing rights of a product developed within the framework of the approved program or which results therefrom, outside of Israel.
 
The State of Israel does not own intellectual property rights in technology developed with NATI funding and there is no restriction on the export of products manufactured using technology developed with NATI funding. The technology is, however, subject to transfer of technology and manufacturing rights restrictions as described above. For a description of such restrictions, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Operations in Israel. NATI approval is not required for the export of any products resulting from the research or development or for the licensing of any technology in the ordinary course of business.
 
Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969
 
We believe that Protalix Ltd. currently qualifies as an “Industrial Company” within the meaning of the Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969, or the Industry Encouragement Law. The Industry Encouragement Law defines “Industrial Company” as a company resident in Israel and incorporated in Israel, that derives 90% or more of its income in any tax year (other than specified kinds of passive income such as capital gains, interest and dividends) from an “Industrial Enterprise” operating in Israel (including Judea & Samara territories and the Gaza strip), that it owns. An “Industrial Enterprise” is defined as an enterprise whose major activity in a given tax year is industrial production.
 
The following corporate tax benefits, among others, are available to Industrial Companies:
 

· | amortization of the cost of purchased know-how and patents over an eight-year period for tax purposes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | accelerated depreciation rates on equipment and buildings;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | under specified conditions, an election to file consolidated tax returns with other related Israeli Industrial Companies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expenses related to a public offering are deductible in equal amounts over three years.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Eligibility for the benefits under the Industry Encouragement Law is not subject to receipt of prior approval from any governmental authority. It is possible that Protalix Ltd. may fail to qualify or may not continue to qualify as an “Industrial Company” or that the benefits described above will not be available in the future.
 
Tax Benefits for Research and Development
 
Under specified conditions, Israeli tax laws allow a tax deduction by a company for research and development expenditures, including capital expenditures, for the year in which such expenditures are incurred. These expenditures must relate to scientific research and development projects and must be approved by NATI. Furthermore, the research and development projects must be for the promotion of the company and carried out by or on behalf of the company seeking such tax deduction. However, the amount of such deductible expenditures is reduced by the sum of any funds received through government grants for the finance of such scientific research and development projects. Expenditures not so approved are deductible over a three-year period. 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 232 employees, of whom 29 have a Ph.D. or an M.D.in their respective scientific fields. We believe that our relations with these employees are good. We believe that our success will greatly depend on our ability to identify, attract and retain capable employees. The Israeli Ministry of Labor and Welfare is authorized to make certain industry-wide collective bargaining agreements, or Expansion Orders, that apply to types of industries or employees including ours. These agreements affect matters such as cost of living adjustments to salaries, length of working hours and week, recuperation, travel expenses, and pension rights. Otherwise, our employees are not represented by a labor union or represented under a collective bargaining agreement. See “Risk Factors—We depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products.”
