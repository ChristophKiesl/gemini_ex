 Industry Overview 
 Background.  We provide software and services solutions that help companies around the world monetize and digitally enable the customer experience.  While our heritage is born out of the communications industry, we count among our customers some of the world’s largest and most sophisticated communications, financial services, healthcare, and media and entertainment companies, as well as a long list of governmental entities, with an increasingly diversified revenue mix.  Our solutions allow service providers to:
  
• | Monetize new revenue streams through multiple services, across multiple locations and channels, quickly.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimize their business costs to enable the redeployment of capital to support business growth and transformation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Protect and maintain existing revenue streams by improving service delivery that drives higher customer satisfaction and increases retention.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage data and insights to better know and understand their customers and deliver exceptional experiences.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance their future-readiness so they can adapt quickly and efficiently to industry changes and innovations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Market Trends of Communications Industry. Our primary market, the global communications industry, continues to undergo rapid change and increasing competitiveness.  Some key trends are emerging as communications service providers (“CSPs”) try to evolve and compete in this highly complex ecosystem:

• | Consumer choice: Customers have an increasing number of choices for information, communications, and entertainment services. This shift in power to the consumer requires service providers to adopt and deliver new technologies and services which enable a more ubiquitous, flexible, and personalized customer experience. Service providers – whether more traditional or digital native – are developing offerings to cultivate a more recurring, loyal, and “branded” customer experience. Increasing importance is placed on “brand” and “experience” as they both now play a larger role in purchasing decisions. Customer experience will determine the winners and losers in this “always connected” digital world. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Competitive landscape: The proliferation of digital native service providers (e.g., Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, etc.) has changed the competitive landscape forever. This has forced traditional providers to evaluate the viability of their existing business models, including scale, breadth of offerings, speed to react, and customer experience, and to evolve their businesses to remain not only relevant, but competitive, innovative, and thriving. While consolidation continues between traditional Communications Service Providers (“CSPs”) and content providers (e.g., Charter and Time Warner Cable), companies are also scaling their offerings through acquisitions within their respective media (e.g., Comcast and Sky, Starz and Lionsgate) and communications industries (e.g., T-Mobile and Sprint). Direct-to-consumer offerings are becoming more prevalent, (e.g., Disney+, Comcast’s Peacock, and Discovery+) and cooperation not only with new partners, but even among competitors (e.g., Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are now available on certain traditional cable platforms) is accelerating. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology: Fueled by the intersection of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (“IoT”), cloud technologies, and analytics, service providers are fundamentally changing the way they get their products to market and engage with their customers. 5G technologies will continue to propel the expansion of IoT and sensor-enabled services and devices. IoT will underpin the “service-ification” of offerings — the transition of routine activities and purchases (e.g., checking gas meters, driving a car, buying groceries, etc.) to on demand services and pervasive consumer relationships (e.g., only servicing meters that show faults, optimizing parking spots, recommending dinner meals, etc.). To meet the requirements of this hyper-connected ecosystem, which requires increased speed-to-market, agility, and scalability cost structure, service providers are transitioning their legacy technology infrastructure to a combination of private and public cloud technologies to support billions of device connections. Further, traditional broadband service providers continue to push the boundaries of hybrid-fiber coax and fiber-to-the-home technologies in order to deliver increased bandwidth and customer experiences.

• | New Revenue Sources: CSPs are facing increased pressure to maintain their current as well as find new revenue sources, while managing their cost structure and quality of service delivery as they transform their business. They are navigating declining revenue and profits associated with their traditional services such as wireline voice and video as a result of new or increased competition. In order to offset these declines, CSPs are increasingly looking for ways to improve their cost structure, grow through acquisitions, and launch new revenue-generating services with minimal capital investment. The result is that many CSPs are cutting costs associated with their traditional systems, integrating disparate acquired business operations, and launching new digital services with more flexible, lower-cost solutions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Overall, these market trends drive the demand for scalable, flexible, and cost-efficient revenue management, customer experience, and payment solutions, which we believe will provide our customers opportunities to monetize and grow revenue from their customers in this age of digital transformation.  As a result, we have historically invested meaningfully in research and development (“R&D”) and have acquired companies that enable us to expand our solutions in a timely and efficient manner. We believe that our scalable, modular, and flexible platform-based offerings, combined with our rich domain expertise and ability to effectively migrate customers to our solutions, provide our customers with proven solutions to improve their profitability and their customers’ experiences.  We have specifically built our solutions to offer service providers a phased, incremental approach to transforming their businesses, thereby reducing the business interruption risk associated with this evolution.
 A summary of our revenue by industry for the indicated periods was as follows: 
  
 | 2020 | | | 2019 | | | 2018

Business Strategy 
 Our vision is to channel the power of all to make ordinary customer experiences extraordinary.  We do this by focusing on three goals:
 Energizing and developing our Employees.  Our diverse group of employees make us exceptional and separate us from our competition.  They are ambassadors of the CSG brand and values; they are the point of connection with our customers, for each other, and within our communities.
 Delivering for our Customers.  Our customers depend on us to help them achieve their business objectives.  We have established a reputation for doing what we say, being easy to do business with, and delivering highly scalable, robust solutions.  This reputation has resulted in our becoming a trusted enabler and partner to our customers.
 Enhancing stockholder value.  One of our key responsibilities is to deliver long-term value creation to shareholders by driving profitable growth.  We achieve this through thoughtfully investing in our business and returning an appropriate amount of capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.
 We believe the successful execution of our goals will allow us to grow revenue and earnings, and therefore, create long-term value for our customers, employees, and stockholders. 
 Our strategic focus to accomplish our goals is as follows:
 Drive Profitable Growth through Long-Term Relationships:  Our relentless focus on our customers is built upon providing market-leading solutions, world-class operations, delivery capabilities and services, and helping our customers solve their toughest challenges.  By building strong, long-term relationships based on trust and by delivering on our commitments (i.e., doing what we say), our customers stay and grow with us.  Further, we are focused on extending our brand and market presence outside our core global communications industry.
 Lead with Technology Innovation:  We believe our broad portfolio of on-premise, cloud and pre-integrated solutions give service providers a competitive advantage.  These solutions allow service providers to efficiently manage their traditional businesses while being able to quickly deliver new digital services and a more personalized and relevant experience to their consumers.  We continually add new relevant capabilities to what we do as a company, both in terms of our people and our solutions.  
 Deliver an Exceptional Customer Experience:  We believe we deliver more business value by having developed a long track record of doing what we say and being easy to do business with.  We do this by putting the customer at the heart of our decision-making which is always directed at improving our agility, delivery capabilities, operational excellence, efficiency, and reliability to enable our customers’ success.
 Attract and Retain Talent:  In order to maintain our competitiveness in the market, we foster a culture in which our diverse workforce can do their best work.  We do this by investing in our people and programs that foster a culture of diversity, innovation, collaboration, and professional fulfillment. 
 In short, we believe our strategy is a key enabler to help our customers compete more effectively, efficiently, and successfully in an evolving market.

 See the Significant Customer Relationships section of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) for additional information regarding our business relationships with these key customers. 
 Research and Development.  Our customers around the world are facing competition from new entrants and at the same time, are deploying new services at a rapid pace and dramatically increasing the complexity of their business operations. Therefore, we continue to make meaningful investments in R&D to ensure that we stay ahead of our customers’ needs and advance our customers’ businesses as well as our own. We believe our value proposition is to provide scalable solutions that help our customers ensure that each customer interaction is an opportunity to create value and deepen the business relationship. 
 Our total R&D expenses for 2020 and 2019 were $122.8 million and $128.0 million, respectively, or approximately 12% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenue.  We anticipate the level of R&D investment in the near-term to be relatively consistent with that of 2020.
 There are certain inherent risks associated with significant technological innovations.  Some of these risks are described in this report in our Risk Factors section below.

• | We leverage our 35+ year history in running highly scalable, complex business support solutions to improve operational efficiencies and effectiveness. For our managed services customers, we assume long-term responsibility for delivering our software solutions and related operations under a defined scope and specified service levels. Under managed services agreements, we may operate software products (primarily our software solutions) on behalf of our customers: (i) out of a customer’s data center; (ii) out of a data center we own and operate; or (iii) out of a third-party data center (including public cloud providers) we contract with for such services.

 Historically, a substantial percentage of our total revenue has been generated from our revenue management and customer engagement solutions.  These solutions are expected to provide a large percentage of our total revenue in the foreseeable future as well. 
 Business Acquisitions. Our strategy includes acquiring assets and businesses which provide the technology and personnel to expedite our solutions and services development efforts, provide complementary solutions and services, increase market share, and/or provide access to new markets and customers.

Professional Services. We employ professional services experts globally who bring a wide-ranging expertise – including solution architecture, project management, systems implementation, system integration, and business consultancy – to every project.  We apply a structured methodology to each of our engagements, leveraging consistent world-class processes, best-practice programs, and systemized templates in the development of our solutions. 
 Sales and Marketing. We organize our sales efforts to customers primarily within our geographically dispersed, dedicated account teams, with senior level account managers who are responsible for new revenue and renewal of existing contracts within a customer account.  The account teams are supported by sales support personnel who are experienced in the various solutions and services that we provide. 
 Competition. The market for revenue management solutions and services in the global communications industry, as well as in other industries we serve, is highly competitive.  We compete with both independent providers and in-house developers of customer management systems.  We believe that our most significant competitors in our primary markets are Amdocs Limited and NEC Corporation (specifically their Netcracker division); network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Huawei; and customer-developed internal solutions.  Some of our actual and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, and technological resources than us and in some instances, we may partner and collaborate with our competitors on large opportunities and projects. 
 We believe service providers in the multiple industry verticals that we serve use the following criteria when selecting a vendor for the mission critical management of their revenue, customer experience, and digital ecosystem: (i) functionality, scalability, flexibility, interoperability, and architecture of the software assets; (ii) the breadth and depth of pre-integrated product solutions; (iii) solution quality, customer service, and support; (iv) operational excellence and reliability; (v) quality of R&D efforts; and (vi) total cost of ownership.  We believe that our solutions allow us to compete effectively in these areas. 
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, and patent laws in the United States (“U.S.”) and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality, and other types of contractual arrangements to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our solutions.  Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or misappropriated.  Although we hold a select number of patents and patent applications on some of our newer solutions, we do not rely upon patents as a primary means of protecting our rights in our intellectual property.  In any event, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties.  Also, much of our business and many of our solutions rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms.  Our failure to adequately establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, and results of operations.  For a description of the risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors - Failure to Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights or Claims by Others That We Infringe Their Intellectual Property Rights Could Substantially Harm Our Business, Financial Position and Results of Operations,” and “Item 1A – Risk Factors - We Rely on A Limited Number of Third-Party Vendor Relationships to Execute Our Business Which Exposes Us to Supply Disruptions, Costs Increases, and Cyber-Attacks.” 
Regulatory Matters  
 We are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations govern matters that include environmental and occupational health and safety matters. Additionally, these laws and regulations also require us to obtain and comply with permits, registrations, and other authorizations issued by governmental authorities.  These authorities can modify or revoke our permits, registrations, or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions.  We expect to incur ongoing costs to comply with existing and future requirements.
 We are also subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which we operate.  Additionally, as a U.S. entity operating through subsidiaries in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing, and custom laws that regulated the flow of funds between CSG and its subsidiaries.  We are also required to be in compliance with transfer pricing, securities laws, and other statutes and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and other countries’ anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.

In addition, we are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, consumer credit, protection, and fraud.  An increasing number of government and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including financial information, social security numbers, and health information.  We are also subject to labor and employment laws, including regulations established by the U.S. Department of Labor and other local regulatory agencies, which sets laws governing working conditions, paid leave, workplace safety, wage and hour stands, and hiring and employment practices.
 We believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in all material respects, and that we hold all necessary permits to operate our business in each jurisdiction in which we operate. Laws and government regulations are subject to change and interpretation. In some cases, compliance with applicable laws and regulations may cause us to make additional capital and operational expenditures. While there are no current regulatory matters that we expect to be material to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows, there can be no assurances that existing or future environmental laws or other regulations applicable to our operations would not lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
 Human Capital  
 As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 4,807 employees, an increase of 468 employees when compared to the number of employees we had as of December 31, 2019.  Of our total employees, 2,332 are located in the U.S. and 2,475 are located in 22 foreign countries.  We are subject to various foreign employment laws and regulations based on the country in which our employees are located. Based on the results of a recent employee survey, we believe our relations with our employees are good.
 Our success is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain qualified employees.  We are dedicated to being an employer of choice by maintaining a work environment that is designed to recruit and motivate top talent.  We are committed to building a culture of diversity, professional growth, and high performance through offering our employees challenging and engaging growth opportunities that contribute to their overall career development.  
 We invest in creating and maintaining a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment for all employees.  Our work environment requires each and every employee be treated with dignity and respect and be free from discrimination and harassment. We expect all of our employees to observe the highest level of business ethics and live our core values – be customer obsessed, be authentic, be bold, be relentless, be agile, and be inclusive.  
 We believe our culture serves as a competitive differentiator in the marketplace and gives CSG a competitive edge.  
 Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, we have remained focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, while meeting the needs of our customers.  During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we formed a COVID-19 Steering Team that has been leading and coordinating our overall response.  These efforts included moving a large percentage of our workforce to a remote working environment and significantly reducing travel.  For those locations that remain open, such as our statement production centers, we require daily temperature checks and self-assessments.  Additionally, we have reconfigured our office spaces to ensure proper social distancing, distributed personal protective equipment, and secured additional cleaning services and supplies.  We also enhanced a number of our benefits to support our employees though the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, to include extended overtime pay and spot bonus awards to those employees at our statement production centers, and a one-time cash bonus given to all CSG employees. We continue to provide work from home options to those employees who are able to conduct business remotely through December 31, 2021, or such later date as conditions warrant.
