We market and sell cold weather accessories, fashion scarves, wraps and other trend accessories primarily under our Steve Madden®, BB Dakota®, Cejon®, Betsey Johnson® and Big Buddha® brand names and private labels to department stores and specialty stores.
Retail Segment
As of December 31, 2020, we owned and operated 218 retail stores, including 143 Steve Madden full-price stores, 66 Steve Madden outlet stores, one Steven store, one Superga store and seven e-commerce websites (Steve Madden, Superga, Betsey Johnson, Blondo, Dolce Vita, GREATS and BB Dakota; our Jocelyn website was terminated as of December 31, 2020). In 2020, we added three full-price stores and two outlet stores and closed nine full-price stores, four outlet stores and one e-commerce website. In addition, during 2020, we closed 14 concessions in South Africa and one concession in Taiwan and opened one concession in China, ending the year with 17 company-operated concessions in international markets. Steve Madden stores are located in major shopping malls and in urban street locations across the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Israel, China and Taiwan.
We believe that our direct to consumer business ("DTC") will continue to enhance overall sales and profitability as well as our ability to react quickly to changing consumer trends. Our DTC business also serves as a marketing tool that allows us to strengthen global brand recognition and to showcase selected items from our full line of branded and licensed products. Furthermore, it provides us with a channel to test and introduce new products, designs and merchandising strategies. We often test new designs of Steve Madden products in our retail business before scheduling them for mass production and wholesale distribution. In addition to these benefits, we have been able to leverage sales information gathered at Steve Madden retail to assist our wholesale customers in their order placement and inventory management. Our stores play an important role in our integrated retail strategy and also serve as fulfillment and return locations for our e-commerce business. We have also launched buy online, pickup in-store in all U.S. full-price locations. We expect to open three to five new retail stores in international markets and close two to five locations, globally in 2021.
First Cost Segment
The First Cost segment earns commissions for serving as a buying agent for footwear products under private labels for many of the large mass-market retailers, shoe chains and other mid-tier retailers. As a buying agent, we utilize our expertise and our relationships with shoe manufacturers to facilitate the production of private label shoes to customer specifications. We believe that operating in the private label market provides us additional non-branded sales opportunities and leverages our overall sourcing and design capabilities. Our First Cost segment earns commissions serving as a buying agent for the procurement of women's, men's and children's footwear for large retailers. In addition, by leveraging the strength of our Steve Madden brands and product designs, we are able to partially recover our design, product and development costs from our suppliers.
Licensing Segment
We license our Steve Madden®, Steven by Steve Madden® and Madden Girl® trademarks for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of apparel, outerwear, hosiery, jewelry, watches, eyeglasses, sunglasses, hair accessories, umbrellas, bedding and bath, and luggage. In addition, we license the Betsey Johnson® trademark for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of women's and children’s apparel, hosiery, fragrance and beauty, sleepwear, swimwear, activewear, jewelry, hair accessories, watches, slippers, bedding and bath, luggage, umbrellas and medical scrubs. We also license the Dolce Vita® trademark for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of swimwear and the FREEBIRD by Steven® trademark for operation of retail stores. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to pay us a royalty based on actual net sales, a minimum royalty in the event that specified net sales targets are not achieved and a percentage of sales for advertising the brand.
See Note Q to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information relating to our five operating segments.
Product Design and Development
We have established a reputation for our creative designs, marketing and trendy products at affordable price points. Our future success will substantially depend on our ability to continue to anticipate and react swiftly to changing consumer demands. To meet this objective, we have developed what we believe is an unparalleled design process that allows us to recognize and respond quickly to changing consumer demands. Our design team strives to create designs that fit our image, reflect current or anticipated trends and can be manufactured in a timely and cost-effective manner. Most new products are tested in select Steve Madden retail stores. Based on these tests, among other things, management selects our products that are then offered for wholesale and retail distribution nationwide. We believe that our design and testing processes and flexible sourcing models provide our brands with a significant competitive advantage allowing us to mitigate the risk of incurring costs associated with the production and distribution of less desirable designs.
Product Sourcing and Distribution
We source each of our product lines separately based on the individual design, style and quality specifications of the products in such product lines. We do not own or operate any foreign manufacturing facilities; rather, we use agents and our own sourcing office to source our products from independently owned manufacturers primarily in China and also in Cambodia, Mexico, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Italy and other European nations. We have established relationships with a number of manufacturers and agents in each of these countries. We have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or supply contracts. We believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist for the manufacture of our products.
We continually monitor the availability of the principal raw materials used in our footwear, which are currently available from a number of sources in various parts of the world. We track inventory flow on a regular basis, monitor sell-through data and incorporate input on product demand from wholesale customers.
The manufacturers of our products are required to meet quality, human rights, safety and other standard requirements. We are committed to the safety and well-being of the workers throughout our supply chain.
Our products are manufactured overseas and most of our products are shipped via ocean freight carriers to ports principally in California and to a lesser extent in New Jersey, and via truck from Mexico to our third-party distribution facility in Texas. We rely to a lesser extent on air carriers for the shipping of products. Once our products arrive in the U.S., we distribute them mainly from six third-party distribution centers, four located in California, one located in Texas, and one located in New Jersey. Our products are also distributed through a Company-operated distribution center located in Canada. Our products are also distributed through our third-party distribution facility in Mexico. By utilizing distribution facilities specializing in fulfillment for certain wholesale accounts, Steve Madden retail stores and Internet customers, we believe that our customers are served more promptly and efficiently. Suppliers of products for our businesses in Canada and Mexico and our joint ventures in Europe, South Africa, Israel, Taiwan and China ship to ports in the respective countries, and products for our overseas distributors are shipped to freight forwarders primarily in China and Mexico where the distributor arranges for subsequent shipment.
Customers
Our wholesale customers consist principally of better department stores, major department stores, mid-tier department stores, national chains, mass merchants, value priced retailers, specialty stores and online retailers. These customers, in no particular order, include:

Nordstrom, Inc. | The TJX Companies, Inc.
Dillard's, Inc. | Amazon.com, Inc. 
Macy's, Inc. | Ross Stores, Inc. 
Designer Brands, Inc. | Walmart Inc. 
Kohl's Corporation | Target Corporation 

For the year ended December 31, 2020, Walmart Inc. represented approximately 13.9% of total revenue. At December 31, 2020, Walmart Inc. represented 19.0% of total accounts receivable, Target Corporation represented 14.9% of total accounts receivable, Ross Stores, Inc. represented 11.8% of total accounts receivable, The TJX Companies, Inc. represented 11.7% of total accounts receivable and Nordstrom, Inc. represented 10.3% of total accounts receivable. The Company did not have any other customers who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue or any other customers who accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable.
Distribution Channels
United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, South Africa, Israel, Taiwan and China
We sell our products principally through department stores, specialty stores, online retailers, luxury retailers, national chains and mass merchants in the United States, Canada, Mexico and certain European nations. In addition, we sell our products in our Company-owned retail stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico, under our joint ventures in Europe, South Africa, Israel, Taiwan and China, and on our e-commerce websites. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our two Wholesale segments and our Retail segment generated net sales of approximately $949,554 and $239,389, or 79% and 20% of our total revenue, respectively. Each of these distribution channels is described below.
Department Stores. We currently sell our products to approximately 1,800 doors of 12 department store retailers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and certain European nations. Our major accounts include Nordstrom, Inc., Macy's, Inc., Dillard's, Inc., Belk, Inc. and Bloomingdale's, Inc.
We provide merchandising support to our department store customers, including in-store fixtures and signage, supervision of displays and merchandising of our various product lines. Our wholesale merchandising effort includes the creation of in-store concept shops in which we showcase a broader collection of our branded products. These in-store concept shops create an environment that is consistent with our image and are designed to enable the retailer to display and sell a greater volume of our products per square foot. In addition, these in-store concept shops encourage longer term commitment by the retailer to our products and enhance consumer brand awareness.
In addition to merchandising support, our key account executives maintain weekly communications with their respective accounts to guide them in placing orders and to assist them in managing inventory, assortment and retail sales. We also leverage our sell-through data gathered at our retail stores to assist department stores in allocating their open-to-buy dollars to the most popular styles in the product line and phasing out styles with weaker sell-through, which, in turn, reduces markdown exposure at the end of the season.
National Chains and Mass Merchants. We currently sell to national chains and mass merchants throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and certain European nations. Our major accounts include Walmart Inc., Target Corporation and Kohl's Corporation.
Shoe Chains/Specialty Stores. We currently sell to shoe chains and specialty store locations throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and certain European nations. Our major specialty store accounts include DSW Designer Brands, Famous Footwear and Gap, Inc. We offer our specialty store accounts similar merchandising, sell-through and inventory tracking support offered to our department store accounts.
Off-Price. We currently sell to off-price retailers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and certain European nations. Our major accounts include The TJX Companies, Inc., Ross Stores, Inc. and Burlington Stores, Inc.
Internet Sales. We operate seven Internet e-commerce website stores (Steve Madden, Superga, Betsey Johnson, Blondo, Dolce Vita, GREATS and BB Dakota; our Jocelyn website was terminated as of December 31, 2020) where customers can purchase numerous styles of our Steve Madden Women's, Steven, Madden Men's, Superga, Betsey Johnson, Blondo, Dolce Vita and GREATS footwear and BB Dakota and BB Dakota x Steve Madden apparel and accessory products, as well as selected styles of Madden Girl footwear and accessory products. We also sell to online retailers throughout the United States, Europe, and Canada. Our major accounts include Zappos, Amazon, Zolando, and ASOS.
Steve Madden, Steve Madden Outlet, Steven and Superga Retail Stores. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 143 Steve Madden full-price stores within the United States, Canada and Mexico and under our joint ventures in South Africa, China, Taiwan and Israel. We also operated 66 Steve Madden outlet stores, one Steven store and one Superga store within the United States. We also operated seven e-commerce websites (Steve Madden, Superga, Betsey Johnson, Blondo, Dolce Vita, GREATS and BB Dakota; our Jocelyn website was terminated as of December 31, 2020). We believe that our retail stores will continue to enhance overall sales and profitability, and our ability to react swiftly to changing consumer trends. Our stores play an important role in our integrated retail strategy and also serve as fulfillment and return locations for our e-commerce business. In 2020 we launched a program where customers can buy online and pick up in store at all of our Steve Madden full-price locations within the United States. We have also launched buy-online-return-in-store in select locations. Our stores also serve as a marketing tool that allows us to strengthen global brand recognition and to showcase selected items from our full line of branded and licensed products. Furthermore, our retail stores provide us with a channel to test and introduce new products, designs and merchandising strategies. We often test new designs at our Steve Madden retail stores before scheduling them for mass production and wholesale distribution. In addition to these test marketing benefits, we have also been able to leverage sales information gathered at Steve Madden retail stores to assist our wholesale customers in their order placement and inventory management.
A typical Steve Madden store is approximately 1,500 to 2,000 square feet and is located in a mall or street location that we expect will attract the highest concentration of our core demographic, style-conscious customer base. The Steven and Superga stores, which are generally the same size as our Steve Madden stores, have a more sophisticated design and format styled to appeal to a more mature target audience. The typical outlet store is approximately 2,000 to 2,500 square feet and is located within outlet malls throughout the United States. Our stores play an important role in our integrated retail strategy and serve as fulfillment and return locations for our e-commerce business. We have also launched buy online, pickup in-store in select locations. 
International Distributors
In addition to the countries and territories mentioned above, our products are available in many other countries and territories worldwide via retail selling and distribution agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, the distributors and retailers purchase product from us and are generally required to open a minimum number of stores each year and to pay a fee for each pair of footwear purchased and an additional sales royalty as a percentage of sales or a predetermined amount per unit of sale. Most of the distributors are required to purchase a minimum number of our products within specified periods. The agreements currently in place expire on various dates and include automatic renewals at the distributors' option provided certain conditions are met. These agreements are exclusive in their specific territories, which include certain European countries, the Middle East, South and Central America, Oceania and various countries in Asia.
Competition
The fashion industry is highly competitive. We compete with specialty shoe, apparel and accessory companies as well as companies with diversified footwear product lines, such as Aldo, Sam Edelman, Jessica Simpson, Lucky Brand and Vince Camuto. Our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do. We believe effective marketing and advertising, favorable brand image, fashionable styling, high quality, value and fast manufacturing turnaround are the most important competitive factors, and we intend to continue to employ these elements in our business. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Marketing and Sales
We have focused on creating an integrated-brand building program to establish our Company as a leading designer of fashion footwear for style-conscious women and men. Principal marketing activities include social media and digital marketing efforts, influencer marketing, public relations, including product and brand placements in lifestyle and fashion magazines and digital outlets, in-store promotions, and events, as well as public and media appearances by our founder and Creative and Design Chief, Steven Madden. We continue to promote our e-commerce websites where customers can purchase Steve Madden, Steven, Superga, Betsey Johnson, Blondo, Dolce Vita and GREATS footwear and BB Dakota and BB Dakota x Steve Madden apparel and accessory products, as well as select styles of Madden Girl footwear and accessory products. 
Management Information Systems (MIS) Operations
Sophisticated information systems are essential to our ability to maintain our competitive position and to support our growth. Our Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system is an integrated system that supports our wholesale business in the areas of finance and accounting, manufacturing-sourcing, purchase order management, customer order management and inventory control. All of our North American wholesale businesses (other than Canada, which has a separate ERP system) and our Asia first-cost and sourcing operations are operated through this ERP system. Our warehouse management system is utilized by the majority of our third-party logistics providers and is fully integrated with our ERP system. A point-of-sale system for our U.S. retail stores is integrated with a retail inventory management/store replenishment system. We have transitioned our e-commerce software to a major cloud-based provider. Complementing all of these systems are ancillary systems and third-party information processing services, including, among others, supply chain, business intelligence/data warehouse, Electronic Data Interchange, credit card processing and payroll. We undertake updates of all of these management information systems on a periodic basis in order to ensure that our functionality is continuously improved. In 2019, we invested $8,200 in a new data and recovery center, with substantially all of the project going into production in 2020.
Trademarks 
We consider our Company-owned trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and have registered many of our marks in the United States and 151 other countries and in numerous International Classes. From time to time, we adopt new trademarks and new logos and/or stylized versions of our trademarks in connection with the marketing of new product lines. We believe that these trademarks have significant value and are important for purposes of identifying our Company, the marketing of our products and the products of our licensees, distinguishing them from the products of others. What follows is a list of the trademarks we believe are most significant to our business:

Steve Madden® | Report® 
Steven by Steve Madden® | Report Signature® 
Steven® | Dolce Vita® 
Madden Girl® | DV8® 
Stevies® | DV® 
Stevies plus Design® | DV DOLCE VITA® 
Topline® | MadLove® 
Betseyville® | Blondo® 
Betsey Johnson® | Blondo Waterproof plus Heart Design®

LUV BETSEY by Betsey Johnson Design® | SM Pass® 
Blue by Betsey Johnson® | COOL PLANETTM 
Steve Madden plus Design® | BB Dakota® 
FREEBIRD By Steven® | GREATS® 

We act aggressively to register trademarks and we monitor their use in order to protect them against infringement. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to effectively obtain rights to our marks worldwide. Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, our marks and other proprietary rights or that we will be able to resolve any such conflicts successfully. Our failure to adequately protect our trademarks from unlawful and improper appropriation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations.
Trademark Licensing
Our strategy for the continued growth of our business includes expanding our presence beyond footwear, apparel and accessories through the selective licensing of our brands. As of December 31, 2020, we license our Steve Madden®, Steven by Steve Madden® and Madden Girl® trademarks for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of outerwear, hosiery, jewelry, watches, eyeglasses and sunglasses, umbrellas, bedding, luggage, fragrance and men’s leather accessories. In addition, we license the Betsey Johnson® trademark for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of women's and children’s apparel, hosiery, swimwear, slippers, fragrance and beauty, sleepwear, activewear, medical scrubs, jewelry, watches, eyeglasses and sunglasses bedding and bath, luggage, umbrellas and household goods. We also license the Dolce Vita® trademark for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of swimwear and the FREEBIRD by Steven® trademark for operation of retail stores. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to pay us a royalty based on actual net sales, a minimum royalty in the event that specified net sales targets are not achieved and a percentage of sales for advertising the brand.
In addition to the licensing of our trademarks, we in-license the trademarks of third parties for use in connection with certain of our product lines. Generally, these licensing arrangements require us to make advertising payments to the licensor as well as royalty payments equal to a percentage of our net sales and/or a minimum royalty and in some cases additional payments in the event that specified net sales targets are not achieved. 
See Notes C and P to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional disclosure regarding these licensing arrangements.
Human Capital Resources

Most of our part-time employees work in the Retail segment. Approximately 1,700 of our employees are located in the United States, approximately 600 employees are located in China and Hong Kong, approximately 180 employees are located in Canada, approximately 160 employees are located in Mexico, approximately 60 employees are located in Taiwan, approximately 60 employees are located in South Africa and approximately 40 employees are located in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a union. Our management considers relations with our employees to be good. We have never experienced a material interruption of our operations due to a labor dispute. 
Culture 
Steve Madden is for the bold, expressive, and ambitious. Our core values – authenticity, initiative, tenacity, humility and trust are key to our competitive edge and are embedded throughout all levels of our Company. They motivate our growth, inspire our innovation, define our culture, and set the standard for all of our actions. 
Authenticity: Show up to work as your true self 
Initiative: Act upon good ideas quickly and be ready to iterate 
Tenacity: Look at problems from all sides and be resourceful 
Humility: Think from the perspective of others and always be open to learning 
Trust: Build strong relationships with good will and integrity 
Career Development 
The fashion landscape is constantly shifting and evolving, which makes it especially important for us to invest in the ongoing career development of our employees. In service of this objective, we constantly seek out, promote, and improve upon internal programs and processes that make it possible for employees to reach their full potential. Some examples of this focus include our ongoing professional development relationship with the University of Arizona Global Campus, our tuition reimbursement program, our internal employee learning opportunities, and external conference and workshop offerings around specific industry content as well as leadership, coaching, and management training in general. Mentoring, timely performance evaluations and feedback are also key elements of our career development efforts at our Company. 
Diversity and Inclusion 
We believe that finding, employing and retaining people from all backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, lifestyles and belief systems have been the cornerstones of meeting the needs of our diverse consumer base and building a global business. By 
embracing a diverse and inclusive workplace, we create an environment that offers all our employees opportunities to succeed. We want all our employees to be as successful as they can be and to reach their full potential no matter who they are, where they are from or what they believe. In the spirit of this core belief, we strive to build an increasingly inclusive culture where all employees feel free to express themselves and have opportunities to grow. In 2020, we engaged in the following diversity initiatives, among others: 
•we established a Diversity and Inclusion Council made up of key leaders in our Company to oversee the implementation of our detailed Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan; 
•employees formed two employee resource groups - one for Black employees and allies called Black Sole and one for LGBTQ employees and allies called SM Pride; 
•we signed the Open to All pledge with other major brands and retailers; 
•we joined the Black in Fashion Council;
•we implemented Company-wide Diversity and Inclusion training;
•we joined Hive Diversity and are partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to establish diverse pipelines of talent and expand our recruiting; and 
•we launched Adaptive Kids footwear, soon to expand to adults.
Wellness 
We see personal health and fitness of our employees as key to long-term professional success, which is why we offer benefits and programs focused on physical, emotional, and financial well-being. These include mindfulness and meditation training, financial wellness seminars, health fairs, discounted gym memberships, free flu shots, and on-site discounted food. We also offer an Employee Assistance Program with a range of programs, resources and tools that can help with myriad issues. To help manage work-life balance, we offer a paid membership to Care.com so employees can find childcare, senior care, special needs care and other related services.
COVID-19 
The health and safety of our team members is of the highest importance. Our focus on the safety of our team members is evident in our response to COVID-19 starting back in March 2020. We initially closed down all stores to ensure the safety of our customers and retail associates, and then we added working from home flexibility for our corporate positions that can be accomplished remotely. We increased cleaning protocols, implemented onsite temperature screening, upgraded our HVAC systems, provided personal protective equipment and related supplies as needed, established new spacing and schedules to maximize social distancing while at work, and have also provided regular communications regarding impacts of COVID-19, including health and safety protocols and procedures. 
Seasonality and Other Factors
Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. For example, the highest percentage of our boot sales occur in the fall and winter months (our third and fourth fiscal quarters) and the highest percentage of our sandal sales occur in the spring and summer months (our first and second fiscal quarters). Historically, some of our businesses, including our Retail segment, have experienced holiday retail seasonality. Our diverse range of product offerings, however, provides some mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the weather, the timing of holidays and larger shipments of footwear, market acceptance of our products, pricing and presentation of the products offered and sold, the hiring and training of additional personnel, inventory write downs for obsolescence, the cost of materials, the product mix among our wholesale, retail and licensing businesses, the incurrence of other operating costs and factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions and actions of competitors. Revenue levels in any period are also impacted by customer decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us.
Backlog
We had unfilled wholesale customer orders of approximately $310,198 and $328,600, as of February 1, 2021 and February 3, 2020, respectively. Our backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, timing of market weeks and wholesale customer purchases of our core products through our open stock program. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period may not be indicative of eventual shipments.
