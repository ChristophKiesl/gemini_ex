ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.

Overview 
We are a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative biologics focused on saving and improving the lives of pets. Our mission is to bring to our pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that our human family members enjoy. Our core strategy is to identify targets that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and to develop therapeutics based on these validated targets for dogs and cats. We believe that this approach will lead to shorter development times and higher approval rates than pursuing new, non-validated targets. Our current portfolio includes two approved products and over 20 product candidates in development, predominantly biologics. We also have state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing capabilities and a broad intellectual property portfolio.
On March 16, 2020, we announced we will further prioritize biologics programs for dogs and cats and rely primarily on a partnership-focused commercialization model, which is expected to significantly reduce the amount of additional dilutive capital the company will require. We believe monoclonal antibodies are the future of veterinary medicine, and represent the greatest opportunity for value creation, given large potential markets for our programs and our competitive advantage in biologics. As part of the strategic realignment, we will substantially reduce our commercial footprint and discontinue development of canine and feline small molecule programs. This business model is expected to achieve a better return for our shareholders. 
We were incorporated in Delaware in September 2012. The address of our principal executive offices is 1555 Bayshore Highway, Suite 200, Burlingame, CA 94010. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “KindredBio,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (the “2019 Annual Report”) refer to Kindred Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries.
Product Highlights


On March 16, 2020, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell Mirataz® (mirtazapine transdermal ointment), our transdermal drug for the management of weight loss in cats, to Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC for a cash purchase price of $43 million, of which $38.7 million will be paid on the closing date and $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims, alongside an ongoing royalty on global net sales. The acquisition comprises worldwide marketing rights, intellectual property rights, marketing authorizations and associated regulatory documentation, third party supply contracts related to raw material and manufacture of the finished product, and certain product inventory. With commercial sales and marketing teams in 25 countries, and distributor relationships in an additional 68 countries, Dechra is strongly positioned to market Mirataz in the United States, Europe, and globally. Their focus on the sale of technical and value-added specialty pharmaceuticals has led to the development of market-leading brands in the specialty veterinarian sector, particularly within the field of chronic disease management. With a complementary feline product portfolio targeting diseases linked to feline weight loss, Mirataz will represent an important cross-promotional product for Dechra worldwide.

Mirataz is the first and only FDA approved transdermal medication specifically developed for the management of weight loss in cats. Unintended weight loss is a serious unmet medical need in cats, and may be caused by multiple factors, including chronic illness, like chronic kidney disease, or behavioral issues, such as stress. If untreated, it may lead to hepatic lipidosis, which can be a life-threatening condition.
Weight loss in cats represents a leading cause of visits to the veterinarian for cats, and a veterinarian will see on average 7 or more cats per week with this condition. Our research estimates that as many as 9,000,000 cats each year are diagnosed with unintended weight loss caused by varying underlying conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cancer or diabetes, and prior to Mirataz’s launch, approximately 3,000,000 cats being treated for unintended weight loss each year. Mirataz, which is formulated with our proprietary Accusorb™ technology, is applied topically to the cat’s inner ear (pinna) once a day, providing a more attractive application route compared to oral administration. 74% of veterinarians report that ease of administering medication is a primary factor in selecting medication for feline weight loss. The product is classified as a weight gain drug and can be used in cats with various underlying diseases associated with unintended weight loss.
Clinical Data
The pivotal field study, KB105, was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal field study that enrolled 230 cats to assess the effectiveness of Mirataz in managing weight loss in cats. The primary endpoint was percentage change in body weight from Day 1 to Week 2. At Week 2, the mean percent increase in body weight from Day 1 was 3.94% in the Mirataz group (n=83), versus 0.41% in the placebo group (n=94) (p<0.0001). In the target animal safety study, Mirataz was generally well-tolerated and no significant safety concerns were identified. At the label dose, topical administration of mirtazapine ointment was associated with mild, reversible skin changes at the site of dose application (ear).
Commercialization and Distribution
Prior to Mirataz’s sale to Dechra on March 16, 2020, the product was marketed through KindredBio’s commercial team in conjunction with third-party national and regional distributors, who in turn warehouse, ship, market, and sell Mirataz to veterinarians. Consistent with our adoption of a partnership-focused commercialization model, we intend to substantially reduce our companion animal commercial infrastructure, thereby reducing operating expenditures.
Combined sales to three large distributors, namely MWI, Covetrus, and Patterson, each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. In total, these distributors accounted for approximately 85% of our product sales in 2019, with regional, home delivery partners, and e-commerce partners making up the remainder. 
 As of December 31, 2019, we recorded $4.1 million in Mirataz net product revenues compared to $2.0 million in 2018, when the product was launched in July of that year. Approximately 55% of the around 25,000 veterinary clinics in the U.S. purchased Mirataz in 2019. Since launch, approximately 71% of veterinary clinics placed re-orders. 
On December 12, 2019, KindredBio announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization of Mirataz for bodyweight gain in cats experiencing poor appetite and weight loss resulting from chronic medical conditions. Mirataz is the first and only medication approved in the EU to induce bodyweight gain 
2


in cats experiencing poor appetite and weight loss resulting from chronic medical conditions. Europe represents the second largest market for veterinary therapeutics internationally. The authorization is valid in all 28-member states of the European Union, together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, and including the UK. Dechra, which is based in the United Kingdom, plans to launch Mirataz in the UK and the European Union, and intends to conduct the necessary regulatory activities to achieve approvals in other key international markets.
 

ZimetaTM (dipyrone injection) (Zimeta IV) 
On November 25, 2019 KindredBio announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Zimeta™ (dipyrone injection) for the control of pyrexia in horses. Pyrexia, or fever, is associated with a number of underlying diseases and can result in significant negative outcomes, including dehydration, laminitis, muscle wasting, weight loss, and in some cases death. Among performance horses, fever can also lead to loss of training and competition days. There are more than eight million horses in the United States, and over one million are seen by a veterinarian for fever annually. 
As part of the strategic restructuring announcement on March 16, 2020, the company’s equine assets will be segregated into the KindredBio Equine subsidiary, and a strategic review process will commence, which may result in a potential spin-out or divestiture of assets. The subsidiary’s assets will comprise of Zimeta, among several equine pipeline assets, as disclosed in the press release of the same date. Equine is an attractive market, with high willingness to spend and low commercialization costs
Zimeta is the first injectable dipyrone product to receive FDA approval for use in horses. Dipyrone, the active ingredient in Zimeta, is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class and has a centrally acting mechanism of action on the hypothalamus where fever originates and is regulated, and is widely used both for horses and humans as an antipyretic outside of the United States. Outside of the US, other dipyrone products may have label indications for other indications, including use as an anti-spasmodic that can be used in horses without masking the surgical signs of colic.
In humans, the active ingredient in Zimeta can, in very rare cases, cause bone marrow suppression. In some countries, it is still available as prescription or over the counter medication, while in other countries, it has been withdrawn from market. However, the side effects have not been seen in horses, and the product is widely used outside the U.S. by many equine veterinarians.
The active ingredient in Zimeta IV is available as GMP-grade material, and we believe our current manufacturer will be able to provide sufficient quantities for market demand. In addition, we executed a commercial manufacturing agreement with Corden Pharma SPA for the manufacture of Zimeta IV. The agreement provides for production to supply KindredBio’s initial launch and future commercial campaigns, with capabilities to meet excess demand.
We launched Zimeta IV in December 2019 and recorded $127,000 in net product revenues. Additionally, an application for Zimeta IV was made in Canada in November, with anticipated approval in the second quarter of 2020.
Clinical Data

The pivotal field study was a multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled pivotal study that enrolled 138 horses to assess the effectiveness of Zimeta. The primary endpoint was improvement (a 2°F or greater decrease in temperature from baseline) or resolution of fever (a return to normothermia (≤101.0°F)) at hour 6 following treatment. The success rate was approximately 75% in the Zimeta group vs. approximately 20% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001).
Biologic Product Candidates
On March 16, 2020, we announced we will further prioritize our biologics programs for dogs and cats, which we view as our highest potential assets. 
KIND-016
In October 2018, we announced positive topline results from our pilot laboratory effectiveness study of KIND-016, a fully caninized, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-31 (IL-31), for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In addition, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent (Patent No. 10,093,731) for KindredBio's anti-IL31 antibody.
The study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, pilot laboratory study that enrolled 32 dogs to assess the effectiveness of KIND-016 at three doses. A single dose of KIND-016 was administered on day 0 and itching was induced at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 with an injection of canine IL-31.
KindredBio's IL-31 antibody resulted in statistically significant reductions in pruritus (p<0.0001 to p<0.05) across all dose groups and was sustained for 6 to 8 weeks, with a clear dose response. The reduction in the itching score was as high as 86.1%. Based on a preliminary review of the safety data, the drug appears to be well tolerated.
In July 2019, we reported positive topline results from a pilot field effectiveness study for our IL-31 antibody that confirmed the results from our pilot laboratory study. As announced on March 16, 2020, the scale up process is proceeding as planned, and the pivotal effectiveness study is expected to commence in the second half of 2020. 
Canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin condition in dogs and is the leading reason owners take their dog to the veterinarian. Atopic dermatitis is a large market, with the leading two products on the market selling over $700 million per year. We are pursuing a multi-pronged approach toward atopic dermatitis, with a portfolio of promising biologics. Our market research tells us there is strong demand for new biological treatments for pruritic dogs, with 70% of veterinarians, and a higher percentage of dermatologists, expressing a need for alternatives to current therapies.

KIND-025
  As announced on March 16, 2020, the in-life portion of the pilot effectiveness study of KIND-025, a fully caninized, high-affinity fusion protein targeting interleukin-4/13, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs, is complete. We are completing development of our PK assays and expect to read out the study over the coming weeks. The interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathways are key drivers of the inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases.
KIND-032 
In December 2019 we announced the outcome of a positive pilot laboratory study of KIND-032, a fully caninized monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-4 receptor, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In the study, 14 laboratory dogs with clinical signs consistent with atopic dermatitis were dosed with placebo or with KIND-032 at two different doses. The CADESI scores were assessed by board-certified veterinary dermatologists who were blinded to treatment assignments. The study demonstrated that KindredBio's antibody was well-tolerated. Although the study was a single-dose study designed primarily to assess safety and pharmacokinetics, evidence of positive efficacy and dose response was observed at Week 1, as measured by CADESI-04. A second pilot study to further assess efficacy and dosing is planned for 2020.

The IL-4 pathway is a key driver of the inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and several other allergic diseases. Unlike KIND-025, which binds to IL-4 and IL-13 circulating in blood, KIND-032 binds to the IL-4 receptor on the surface of immune cells. 
KIND-510a
In January 2019, we announced positive topline results from our pilot field effectiveness study of KIND-510a, a long-acting feline recombinant erythropoietin that is being developed for the management of anemia in cats. We completed our cGMP fill & finish for feline recombinant erythropoietin at our Elwood, Kansas biologics manufacturing facility in the third quarter of 2019, and the pivotal efficacy study was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019, with enrollment ongoing.
Anemia is a common condition that is estimated to affect millions of older cats. It is often associated with chronic kidney disease, because kidneys produce erythropoietin and chronic kidney disease leads to decreased levels of endogenous erythropoietin. Chronic kidney disease affects approximately half of older cats, making it a leading cause of feline mortality. Human erythropoietins, which are multi-billion-dollar products in the human market, are immunogenic in cats.
KIND-510a is a recombinant feline erythropoietin that has been engineered by KindredBio to have a prolonged half-life. Erythropoietin is an endogenous protein that regulates and stimulates production of red blood cells.
In the study, which enrolled 23 cats with anemia, KIND-510a rapidly increased mean hematocrit (a measure of red blood cell count), with statistically significant improvement seen as early as Week 1 (p<0.0001). The effect was sustained, with continued statistically significant improvement at Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (p<0.0001 at each visit). Compared to baseline, the mean peak improvement in hematocrit was 55.4%.
In addition, 95.5% of the 22 evaluable patients achieved treatment success over the 6-week treatment period, defined prospectively as either a 30% increase in hematocrit value over baseline or the hematocrit value reaching normal range. Furthermore, cats treated with KIND-510a demonstrated statistically significant improvements over baseline (p<0.01 to p<0.05) across all three health-related quality of life (QoL) domains, Vitality, Comfort, and Emotional Wellbeing, as measured by a validated QoL instrument. Based on a preliminary review of the safety data, the drug appears to be well tolerated. 
KIND-030
In August 2019, we announced positive results from our pilot efficacy study of KIND-030, a chimeric, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting canine parvovirus (CPV). This was a 12-dog study, of which 4 dogs were treated prophylactically and 2 dogs were treated after establishment of the infection. All treated dogs survived, compared to none in the applicable placebo group. The effect was seen in both prophylaxis setting, as well as in a treatment setting after establishment of infection. Pivotal studies for this molecule are expected to be completed in 2020. Approval is anticipated by late 2020 or early 2021. 
CPV is the most significant cause of viral enteritis in dogs, especially puppies, with over 90% mortality rate if untreated. Banfield Medical records report that at least 250,000 dogs are infected with parvoviruses each year, excluding emergency rooms, specialty hospitals, shelters, or undiagnosed cases. This does not include puppies that have potentially been exposed to the virus where the prophylaxis product candidate could be used after lisensure if demonstrated effective. While there are vaccines available for CPV, they have to be administered multiple times and many puppies don't receive the vaccine at all, or don't get the complete series. This will not replace the need for vaccination; it may just change the timing of the vaccination post administration. There are currently no approved or unapproved treatments for CPV. Currently, owners spend up to thousands of dollars for supportive care for dogs infected with CPV.
KIND-509
5


The pilot field efficacy study for our anti-TNF antibody for canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been initiated with completion expected to be in the first half of 2020. IBD is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and can affect dogs at any age, but is more common in middle-aged and older dogs.
The majority of canine IBD cases involve chronic states of diarrhea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, inappetence, and other symptoms, certain of which are cited as among the most frequent disorders impacting dogs. For certain dog breeds, the prevalence of diarrhea exceeds 5%. Existing treatments can have significant drawbacks, including limited diets and excessive antibiotic use, which can lead to owner frustration, lapses in treatment adherence, or poor quality of life for the affected animal.
KIND-511
As disclosed in the press release dated March 16, 2020, KIND-511 will be included in KindredBio Equine, for which there is a strategic review process underway. KIND-511 is an anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (“anti-TNF”) treatment for newborn foals. Sick newborn foals, defined as sepsis score ≥ 11 or positive blood culture, are challenging, and difficult to treat and result in approximately 50% mortality. We have completed a pilot field study in sick or septic foals to assess safety and efficacy of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, with positive results. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the difference in survival between the control and placebo groups was statistically significant (p=0.0293). We intend to continue field studies during the 2021 foaling season following discussion with the FDA regarding the pivotal study design for KIND-511. There is currently no FDA-approved therapy.
We have promising new antibody candidates under development, which will be disclosed at a later stage of development and as lead programs further advance. 

Small Molecule Product Candidates
As disclosed in our press release dated March 16, 2020, KindredBio is discontinuing development of canine and feline small molecule candidates as we prioritize our pipeline of innovative biologic candidates. Equine small molecule candidates will be housed in KindredBio Equine, for which there is a strategic review process underway. Pending that review process, development of certain equine candidates may be put on hold.
KIND-012 (dipyrone oral gel) 
We have completed the pivotal field effectiveness study of KIND-012 (dipyrone oral gel) for the treatment of fever in horses and announced positive topline results in December 2017. This study was a multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled pivotal study that enrolled 139 horses to assess the effectiveness of dipyrone oral. The primary endpoint was improvement or resolution of fever 6 hours after treatment. The success rate was approximately 78% in the dipyrone oral group vs. approximately 18% in the placebo group (p = 0.0026). The target animal safety study is also complete, and dipyrone oral was found to be well-tolerated. The FDA has determined the study to be acceptable pending the outcome of additional bridging studies. We have transferred the product to the commercial manufacturer and have agreement with the FDA regarding the data required to show relative bioequivalence to the previously manufactured product. Scientific advice has also been received from the EMA on dossier requirements. Dipyrone oral, which is a proprietary oral gel, is expected to expand use of the drug and build upon the success of Zimeta IV. If approved, this would be the first oral dipyrone product approved in the US and EU. 
KIND-014
KIND-014 is a small molecule product candidate we are developing for treatment of equine gastric ulcers in horses. In May 2018, we announced positive results from our pilot field effectiveness study of KIND-014 for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses. This study was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study that enrolled 53 horses (40 horses in three KIND-014 groups with different doses and dosing schedules, 13 horses in the placebo group). The objective was to determine the effective dose of KIND-014 for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses. At Week 3, the gastric ulcer resolution (gastric ulcer score=0) rates in all three KIND-014 groups were statistically significantly higher than the placebo group (p-values < 0.05). The pivotal field efficacy study for KIND-014 for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses was initiated in December 2019.

Equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) is a common condition in horses which encompasses primary and secondary erosive and ulcerative diseases of both the squamous and glandular parts of the stomach. It affects approximately half of all recreational horses, more than 60% of sport horses, and approximately 90% of racing horses. A variety of clinical signs are associated with EGUS, including poor appetite, poor condition, colic, and behavioral issues.
Market Overview
We believe there are significant unmet medical needs for pets, and that the pet therapeutics segment of the animal health industry is likely to grow substantially as new therapeutics are identified, developed and marketed specifically for pets. We plan to commercialize our feline and canine biologics in the United States through commercial partnerships, and in the European Union (the “EU”) primarily through commercial partnerships, distributors and other third parties.
Relative to human drug development, the development of pet therapeutics is generally faster and less expensive, since it requires fewer clinical studies involving fewer subjects and can be conducted directly in the target species. For example, studies that are typically required for approval of human drugs such as QTC studies, which detect cardiac irregularities, elderly patient studies, renal impairment studies, hepatic impairment studies or costly, long-term genotoxicity studies are not required for pet therapeutics. Based on our progress since inception in September 2012, we believe we can develop biologics in around six years at an average cost of approximately $8 million. The lower cost associated with the development of pet therapeutics permits us to pursue multiple product candidates simultaneously and avoid the binary outcome associated with the development of a single lead therapy by some human biotechnology companies. Because our strategy is to identify targets that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and to develop therapeutics based on these validated targets, we can often advance our programs more rapidly than if we were pursuing unvalidated targets. Biologics could be submitted under USDA, FDA or EMA regulatory authorities for approval. 
We estimate that the total U.S. market for veterinary care was approximately $95.7 billion in 2019, of which veterinary care and product sales comprised $29.3 billion. In 2018, 67% of households owned a pet, which translates to an estimated 97.0 million dogs and 76.0 million cats currently living in the United States. We believe there are many unmet or underserved medical needs and that the pet therapeutics portion of the market can grow significantly as new, safe and effective therapeutics are identified, developed and marketed. We expect continued market growth as new pet therapeutics are developed and owners grow more familiar with the treatment of pets with such therapeutics.
The equine sector shares many similarities with the orphan human market. There are fewer horses than dogs or cats, but the willingness to pay is substantially higher. In addition, the cost of building a commercial infrastructure is much less for the equine market. We believe that as few as three to five representatives are sufficient to launch and support multiple equine products nationally, in conjunction with distribution.

Product Pipeline 
As of March 16, 2020, our product pipeline is focused on innovative biologics for dogs and cats.
The US Department of Agriculture’s (the “USDA”) Center for Veterinary Biologics and the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine have a memorandum of understanding under which animal products are to be regulated by the USDA as biologics, if they are intended for use to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease in animals and they work primarily through an immune process, or by the FDA as drugs, if they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of animal disease if the primary mechanism of action is not immunological or is undefined. Although we believe that most of our current animal biologics will be regulated by the USDA based on their mechanisms of action, certain of our animal biologics will be regulated by the FDA instead of the USDA.
We are currently pursuing over 20 indications with a focus on biologics product candidates. The following table illustrates some of the product candidates that we are developing.
Not all programs are listed. Some are not disclosed for competitive reasons.
Product Selection and Development
We utilize a rigorous screening and review process to identify targets that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and address unmet medical needs in veterinary medicine. In some cases, we identify a chemical or functional equivalent of a validated human drug that addresses the same biological target or pathway. We review these targets with a view to differentiating them from existing treatments, including human products used extra-label in animals, based on ease of administration, method of delivery, dosing regimen, and other similar factors. 
Biologic therapies are typically derived from living organisms. A biologic can be defined as a large complex molecule (nucleic acid and protein platforms) produced from or extracted from a biological or living system. They are made by genetically engineering living cells, and a high level of precision is required in the manufacturing process to produce a consistent biologic product each time. A biologic product can be a monoclonal antibody, a vaccine, a tissue, or various proteins such as cytokines, enzymes, fusion proteins, whole cells, and viral and non-viral gene therapies. Our biologic product candidates are usually based on therapies and targets for which products have been successfully commercialized for humans. Human antibody therapies are expensive and are often ineffective in other species since they are usually immunogenic or recognized as foreign bodies and rejected by the immune systems of dogs, cats, horses, and other animals. We identify or create biologics, including antibodies, that are fully or mostly canine, feline, or equine. We generally intend to seek composition-of-matter and other patents for these new biologics.
In January 2020 we announced that we developed a technology to extend canine antibody half-life by up to three-fold. A patent application for this technology has been filed. 
The study comprised 12 dogs, including four groups with various modifications incorporating KindredBio technology and one wild type canine antibody as control. Half-life extension was observed in all dogs across all 
8


groups other than the wild type, with the magnitude of extension over native antibody ranging from two to three-fold. Additional studies to further differentiate between lead molecules and expand sample size are planned for 2020.
Half-life extension technologies have the potential to improve therapeutic performance in numerous ways. Reduced dosing frequency and/or amount of dosing can lead to improved patient convenience and compliance. It can also substantially lower the cost of goods and enhance profitability and market positioning. In addition, higher drug concentration using the same dose and dosing interval as the parent antibody can result in extended drug exposure and potentially improved efficacy.
In addition, KIND-Bodies, a unique biologics scaffold with certain advantages over traditional monoclonal antibodies, including bi-specific binding, is under development. We have also developed Fc engineering technologies that can improve affinity of canine antibodies to protein A, which is important for manufacturing of antibodies, and other technologies to modify the immune function of antibodies, and we have filed for IP on those technologies.
We have an in-house laboratory capable of protein engineering, cell line development, analytics, and other activities necessary for advancing a world-class biologics pipeline. We believe that we have one of the best biologics teams in the pharmaceutical industry, drawn from some of the top biotechnology companies.
We have constructed a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Burlingame, California for our initial biologic product candidates, which we believe is one of the first GMP biologics plants for veterinary products. We started GMP manufacturing in January 2018 and believe that the plant will position us as a leader in the veterinary biologics field, and potentially afford us an advantage in cost of goods for our products. We acquired a second manufacturing plant in August 2017 in Elwood, Kansas and construction to support initial production lines on our biologics manufacturing is complete. The bioreactors and fill & finish equipment are installed and fully commissioned. The Elwood facility includes approximately 180,000 square feet with clean rooms, utility, equipment, and related quality documentation suitable for small molecule and biologics manufacturing.
Our biologic product candidates are not expected to face generic competition in the United States as there is no pathway for approval of a generic veterinary biologic regulated by the USDA.
Business Strategy 
Key elements of our business strategy are as follows: 
Continue to focus on the development of our pipeline
In addition to our focus on patient enrollment for our pivotal field study of KIND-510a and KIND-014, we expect to initiate pivotal field studies for KIND-030 and KIND-016 in 2020. We are currently developing KIND-509 for inflammatory bowel disease in dogs. Additionally, we are also developing multiple other products. In all, we have over 20 programs for various indications.
Continue to focus on cost-effective research and development execution
In order to execute our studies rapidly and efficiently, we have built an experienced team drawn from both the veterinary and human pharmaceutical industries. We rely primarily on our own personnel or independent contractors, rather than on contract research organizations (“CROs”), for many business-critical tasks, including protocol designs, regulatory interactions, statistics, data management and clinical operations. By doing so, we believe we can maintain higher quality, achieve lower costs and seek regulatory approval more quickly. Since our inception in September 2012, we have been able to quickly and efficiently build and advance our pipeline.
Leverage our antibody and biologics experience
9


Members of our team have extensive experience developing biologics such as antibodies. We are leveraging their expertise to identify and develop antibody-based therapies for pets based on approved human therapies, and to identify appropriate manufacturing technologies for these product candidates.
Leverage our current product pipeline in additional animal species
We intend to develop our product candidates primarily for approval in one or more indications in dogs, cats, and horses. We may consider the development of our current or future product candidates for additional species in the future, but our pipeline currently is focused on dogs, cats and horses only.
Expand our pipeline with additional product candidates
We actively seek to identify biologic therapeutics, or in some cases therapeutic targets, that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans, focusing on small molecules that are already marketed for humans or biologics for which there are no animal counterparts. These therapeutics typically have been tested in animals such as dogs as part of standard toxicology studies in human clinical development. We have identified a number of additional product candidates in the pre-INAD stage that we may potentially pursue. We will seek to protect our product candidates through a combination of patents, know-how and other customary means. Importantly, there is no biosimilar pathway for biologics. 
Commercialize our canine and feline products through commercial partners in the United States and other regions
As disclosed in our March 16, 2020 press release, KindredBio is transitioning to a partnership-focused commercialization model whereby pipeline assets are out-licensed to larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payment, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. Accordingly, the companion animal commercial infrastructure sill be substantially reduced.
Commercialize our equine products with a small direct sales force in the United States and with partners in other regions
We intend to utilize a small equine-specific direct sales force to commercialize Zimeta and future equine products. In addition, select distributor relationships will be used to market equine products directly to veterinarians in the United States. For our equine products, we believe we can accomplish this with a sales force of 3 to 5 sales representatives, once there are multiple products, and reach most of the prescribing equine veterinarians in the United States. We also intend to establish collaborations with distributors or licensing partners to commercialize any of our products that may be approved by the EMA. As noted in our press release dated March 16, 2020, a strategic review process is underway for KindredBio Equine, which may result in a spin-out or divestiture of assets. 
Pet Therapeutics Market
Overview 
U.S. consumers spent an estimated $95.7 billion on their pets in 2019, according to the American Pet Products Association (APPA). The veterinary care segment has been among the fastest growing segments of the overall U.S. pet market. This segment accounted for an estimated $29.3 billion spent on veterinary care in 2019.
We believe several factors will contribute to an increase in spending on pet therapeutics. Pets are generally living longer, with the average lifespan for dogs increasing by nearly a year to 12 years and 13.1 years for cats between 2012 and 2016 according to a study by Banfield Pet Hospitals. As a result, pets are increasingly exhibiting many of the same diseases associated with aging in humans such as cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and diabetes. For example, the incidence of diabetes in dogs has increased by 79.7% since 2006, while in felines, the prevalence of diabetes in cats has increased 18.1% over the same timeframe. The incidence of osteoarthritis in dogs has increased by 82% since 2006 according to the same study. As it is with human health, obesity is a growing concern for pets. The Association for Pet Obesity Prevention estimates that in 2017, 56% of dogs and 60% of cats are overweight or obese, which translates to 50.2 million dogs and 65.5 million cats. According to a 2016 study, in the 
10


past 10 years Banfield Pet Hospitals witnessed a 169 percent increase in overweight cats and a 158 percent increase in overweight dogs. Banfield further reports that obesity in cats and dogs has been linked to more than 20 ailments. Not surprisingly then, Banfield’s records indicate dog owners spend 17% more on healthcare costs and nearly 25% more on medications versus owners of healthy-weight dogs. In addition, pet ownership numbers may increase as more people become aware of the myriad health benefits of pet ownership. According to the Human Animal Bond Research Institute, studies show that some of the benefits of having a dog include helping to lower your blood pressure, decrease your risk of heart disease, and preventing allergies in children.
Among pet owners, there is growing familiarity in treating these pet diseases with medications. According to the APPA, approximately 77% of U.S. dog owners treated their dogs with medications in 2015, an increase of over 50% from the level reported in 2004. In a 2010 poll by the Associated Press, 35% of pet owners are willing to spend $2,000 to treat their pet for a serious medical condition. More recently, a 2017 Harris Poll by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants indicated that 76% of the U.S. adults (1,004, of which 526 identified as pet owners) surveyed would make financial sacrifices for their pets to pay for an emergency expense such as medical care. Additionally, 79% said they would stop eating at restaurants and 67% would give up a vacation to pay for pet-related expenses if they were in a difficult financial situation. Respondents also indicated that they would cancel cable and TV streaming services (61%), sacrifice contributions to their retirement account (37%), cancel a cell phone plan (35%), or forego paying a credit card bill (27%) to pay for their pet’s expenses. We expect pet owners to spend more on their pets’ health and welfare as new therapeutics are developed specifically for pets, particularly as 95% of pet owners considered their pet to be a member of their family, according to a 2015 survey by the Harris Poll of Harris Interactive.
Pet Therapeutics Market Dynamics
The respective businesses of developing and commercializing therapeutics for pets and for humans share a number of characteristics, including the need to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for marketing, manufacture the therapeutics in facilities compliant with GMP requirements and market the therapeutics only for their intended indication based on claims permitted in the product label, and not for other uses, which is referred to as extra-label use.
Despite their similarities, there are a number of important differences between the pet therapeutics and human therapeutics businesses, including:

• | Faster, less expensive and more predictable development. The development of pet therapeutics requires fewer clinical studies in fewer subject animals than the development of human therapeutics and, unlike human therapeutics, is conducted directly in the target animals. We believe our strategy of selecting compounds and targets with demonstrated efficacy and safety in humans enhances the predictability of results and probability of success of our pivotal trials relative to compounds and targets that have not been previously validated.


• | Role and incentives for veterinary practices. In the United States, veterinarians generally serve the dual role of doctor and pharmacist, and pet owners typically purchase medicines directly from their veterinarians. Therapeutics specifically developed for pets enable veterinarians to provide potentially superior treatment options, while also increasing revenue from the sale of these therapeutics.


• | Primarily private-pay nature of veterinary market. Pet owners in the United States generally pay for pet therapeutics out-of-pocket, and 10% of dog owners and 5% of cat owners have health insurance for their pets. As a result, pet owners must make decisions primarily on their veterinarians’ advice regarding available treatment options, rather than on the treatment options’ eligibility for reimbursement by insurance companies or government payers. We believe this results in less pricing pressure than in human healthcare, although the limited adoption of insurance may also reduce pet owners’ ability to pay for therapeutics recommended by their veterinarians.


• | Less generic competition and strong brand loyalty. There is less generic competition in the pet therapeutics industry than in the human healthcare industry. Approximately 14% of veterinary drugs face generic competition, and the percentage of generic prescriptions in the veterinary space is only 7% as compared to approximately 81% for human drugs. For example, Rimadyl, the leading U.S. pet NSAID,

11


lost regulatory exclusivity in 2001, but its sales continued to grow since generic competition was introduced in 2005. We believe that stronger brand loyalty and lack of mandatory generic drug substitution, as in human pharmaceuticals, partially explains the low penetration of generics in veterinary medicine. 
Unmet Medical Needs in the Pet Therapeutics Market
Despite the growing market for pet therapeutics, there are relatively few treatment options approved for use in pets as compared to human therapeutic treatments. As a result, veterinarians often must resort to prescribing products approved for use in humans but not approved, formulated or even formally studied in pets. Veterinarians must then rely upon trial and error or untested rules of thumb to assess the proper dosage needed to be effective in the particular species without undue risk of side effects. The veterinarian must also find a way to administer the human product in animals and determine the appropriate dose to treat the disease in the species, which are important and potentially overlooked practical considerations in the treatment of pets.
Even in disease categories with approved pet therapeutics, significant unmet medical needs remain. For example, the NSAID class of products, commonly prescribed for pain, have potentially serious side effects in dogs that limit their long-term use and may require ongoing monitoring by veterinarians. The treatment of pain in cats is further complicated as a result of their differing biology, which makes NSAIDs toxic.
Animal health companies have been relatively slow to develop new therapeutics for pets and have tended to focus primarily on the larger market for the treatment of livestock and other farm animals. In 2018 in the United States, for every 19 NDAs approved for human therapeutics, one NADA was approved for animal therapeutics. In 2019 Zimeta was the only approved FDA product for horses. Human pharmaceutical companies received FDA approval for 59 novel drugs (non-generic), while pet therapeutic companies received only three novel FDA drug approvals. In the EU, human pharmaceutical companies received EMA approval for 42 novel drugs in 2018, compared to only 3 novel drug approvals for pet therapeutic companies.
We believe that therapeutics specifically developed for pets can extend and improve pets’ quality of life, help veterinarians achieve improved medical outcomes and make the process of administering therapeutics to pets much more convenient. Advances in human medicines have created new therapeutics for managing chronic diseases associated with aging, such as osteoarthritis, cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Pets often suffer from the same disease as humans, including diabetes, arthritis, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease (canine cognitive dysfunction), lupus, Crohn’s disease, Lou Gehrig’s disease (degenerative myelopathy) and others. In most cases, the biologies of the diseases in pets are very similar to those in humans. Because of the similarity of the diseases, many human drugs, when formulated properly and administered in proper doses, are effective in pets. However, most human drugs are neither formulated nor approved for animals.
Commercialization
As stated in our press release dated March 16, 2020, we are substantially reducing our companion animal commercial infrastructure and relaying primarily on a partnership-focused commercialization model, whereby pipeline assets are out-licensed to larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payment, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. We believe this strategy will maximize the value of our pipeline, generate attractive commercial terms, and rely less on dilutive capital. 
According to industry sources, approximately one-third of pet veterinary practice revenue comes from prescription drug sales, vaccinations and non-prescription medicines. We believe veterinarians are self-motivated to prescribe innovative therapeutics that are safe, effective, and supported by reliable clinical data and regulatory approval in order to improve the health of pets, while also generating additional revenue.
Manufacturing
For biologics, we have established our own GMP manufacturing capabilities in Burlingame, California and proceeded to GMP manufacturing in January 2018. In August 2017, we acquired a manufacturing facility in Elwood, Kansas and have completed construction and commissioning. The Elwood facility includes approximately 
12


180,000 square feet with clean rooms, utility, equipment, and related quality documentation suitable for biologics and small molecule manufacturing. The USDA regulates the manufacture of pet biologics under standards that are less stringent than those for human biologics, which may reduce the cost of goods of our biologic product candidates relative to human biologics.
Competition
While there are fewer competitors in the pet therapeutics industry than in the human pharmaceutical industry, the development and commercialization of new animal health medicines is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty animal health medicines companies.
Our potential competitors include large animal health companies, which currently derive the majority of their revenue from livestock medications. For example, in 2019 livestock accounted for 48%, and pets 50%, of sales for Zoetis, a large company focused on animal health. Within the pet therapeutics market, vaccines and parasiticides are currently the greatest sources of revenue.
Large animal health companies include Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Elanco Animal Health Incorporated; and Zoetis, Inc. We will also compete against several animal health companies, such as the Virbac Group, Ceva Animal Health and Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC. We are also aware of smaller companies that are developing products for use in the pet therapeutics market, including Zomedica, Scout Bio, and Anivive Lifesciences. Zoetis and Elanco both recently announced collaborations with Colorado State University and Purdue University, respectively. 
At the product level, we will face competition for Zimeta from Flunixin and phenylbutazone, even though they are not approved for control of fever in horses. In addition, we may face competition from various products including additional products in development. Our products may also face competition from generic medicines and products approved for use in humans that are used extra-label for pets. Some of our other products also may face competition from their human generic equivalents in countries where such equivalents are available.
Many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially more financial, technical and human resources than we do. Many also have far more experience than we have in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal health medicines, including pet therapeutics. In addition, these and other potential competing products may benefit from greater brand recognition and brand loyalty than any that our product candidates may achieve. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we and our products can compete effectively.
Intellectual Property
We intend to rely primarily upon a combination of regulatory exclusivity, patents, trade secret protection, proprietary know-how, license agreements, and confidentiality agreements to protect our product formulations, biologics, processes, therapeutic methods and other technologies, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. We currently have numerous provisional, nonprovisional, and international patent applications pending, and two issued patents, for our IL-31 antibody compositions-of-matter and corresponding methods of use. Because our first approved product and our other small molecule product candidates are based on generic human drugs, there is little, if any, composition-of-matter patent protection available for the API in such product candidates. We have filed patent applications on many of our biologic products. However, even intellectual property protection, if available to us, may not afford us with complete protection against competitors. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our management personnel, as well as that of our other employees, advisors, consultants and contractors, none of which are patentable. To help protect our know-how, and any inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into customary confidentiality and inventions agreements that 
13


prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
Regulatory 
The development, approval and sale of animal health products are governed by the laws and regulations of each country in which we intend to sell our products. To comply with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes and resources to provide oversight of the development and launch of our products and their maintenance in the market. 
United States 
Three federal regulatory agencies regulate the health aspects of animal health products in the United States: the FDA; the USDA; and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). In addition, the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) regulates animal therapeutics that are classified as controlled substances. 
The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (the “CVM”), regulates animal pharmaceuticals under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (the “CVB”), regulates veterinary vaccines and certain biologics pursuant to the Virus, Serum, Toxin Act. The EPA Office of Pesticide Programs (the “OPP”) regulates veterinary pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Many topical products used for treatment of flea and tick infestations are regulated by the EPA.

All of our current product candidates are animal pharmaceuticals or biologics regulated by the CVM or the CVB, respectively. Manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals and biologics, including us, must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture. We are also required to conduct post-approval monitoring of products and to submit reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results, and are subject to regulatory inspection from time to time. In addition, for our controlled substance product candidates, we are required to comply with the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”) and related state laws regarding manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas, recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. 
Requirements for Approval of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals for Pets 
As a condition to regulatory approval for the sale of animal products, regulatory agencies worldwide generally require that a product to be used for pets be demonstrated to: 

• | be safe for the intended use in the intended species;


• | have substantial evidence of effectiveness for the intended use;


• | have a defined manufacturing process that ensures the product can be made with high quality consistency; and


• | be safe for humans handling the product and for the environment.

Safety. To determine that a new veterinary drug is safe for use, most regulatory authorities will require us to provide data from a safety study generated in laboratory cats, dogs, and horses tested at doses higher than the intended label dose, over a period of time determined by the intended length of dosing of the product. In the case of the FDA, the design and review of the safety study and the study protocol can be completed prior to initiation of the study to help assure that the data generated will meet FDA requirements. These studies are conducted under rigorous quality control, including GLP, to assure integrity of the data. They are designed to clearly define a safety margin, identify any potential safety concerns, and establish a safe dose for the product. In addition, safety data from pivotal field studies conducted under GCP standards are evaluated to assure that the product will be safe in the target population. Furthermore, because safety and effectiveness studies must conform to VICH guidelines, which are established under an international program aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration, they can be utilized by regulatory bodies in the European Union, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.
14



Effectiveness. Early pilot studies may be conducted in laboratory cats, dogs, or horses to establish effectiveness and the dose range for each product. Data on how well the drug is absorbed when dosed by different routes of administration and the relationship of the dose to the effectiveness are studied. When an effective dose is established, a study protocol to test the product in real world conditions is developed prior to beginning the study. In the case of the FDA, the pivotal effectiveness field study protocol can be submitted for review and concurrence prior to study initiation, to help assure that the data generated will meet requirements. 
The pivotal field effectiveness study must be conducted with the formulation of the product that is intended to be commercialized, and is a multi-site, randomized, controlled study, generally with a placebo control. To reduce bias in the study, individuals doing the assessment are not told whether the subject is in the group receiving the treatment being tested or the placebo group. In both the United States and the European Union, the number of subjects enrolled in pivotal field effectiveness studies is required to be approximately 100 to 150 animal subjects treated with the test product and a comparable number of subjects in the control group that receive the placebo. In many cases, a pivotal field study may be designed with clinical sites in both the European Union and the United States, and this single study may satisfy regulatory requirements in both jurisdictions. 
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC"). To assure that the product can be manufactured consistently, regulatory agencies will require us to provide documentation of the process by which the API is made and the controls applicable to that process that assure the API and the formulation of the final commercial product meet certain criteria, including quality, purity and stability. After a product is approved, we will be required to communicate with the regulatory bodies any changes in the procedures or manufacturing site. Both API and commercial formulations are required to be manufactured at facilities that practice pharmaceutical GMP.
Environmental and Human Safety. We will not be required under United States law to provide an environmental impact statement for products currently in development if the products are given at the home of the pet’s owner or in a veterinary hospital. If products might result in some type of environmental exposure or release, the environmental impact must be assessed. For approval in the EU, a risk assessment for potential human exposure will be required.
Labeling, All Other Information, and Freedom of Information Summary. We also will be required to submit the intended label for the product, and also any information regarding additional research that has been conducted with the drug, to the CVM and other regulatory bodies for review. We will draft, and submit for regulatory review, the Freedom of Information Summary for use in the United States. This summary outlines the studies and provides substantial information that the FDA uses to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness and then publishes on its website.
Regulatory Process at the FDA 
To begin the development process for products in the United States, we must file an Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) submission with the FDA. We will then usually hold a pre-development meeting with the FDA to reach a general agreement on the plans for providing the data necessary to fulfill requirements for an NADA. We evaluate if drug candidates can benefit from approval under the minor use minor species (MUMS) or expanded conditional approval programs. During development, we will usually submit pivotal protocols to the FDA for review and concurrence prior to conducting the required studies. We will gather and submit data on manufacturing, safety and effectiveness to the FDA for review, and this review will be conducted according to timelines specified in the Animal Drug User Fee Act. These are called technical sections, which collectively form the basis of the NADA. Once all data have been submitted and reviewed for each technical section - safety, effectiveness and CMC - the FDA will issue us a technical section complete letter as each section review is completed, and when the three letters have been issued, we will compile a draft of the Freedom of Information Summary, the proposed labeling, and all other relevant information, and submit these for FDA review. An administrative NADA is a NADA that is submitted after all of the technical sections that fulfill the requirements for the approval of the new animal drug have been reviewed by the CVM and the CVM has issued a technical section complete letter for each of those technical sections. Although this process is not required and submission of a non-administrative NADA is also acceptable, we plan to take advantage of the administrative NADA process to obtain a more timely, phased review. Because the CVM has already reviewed the individual technical sections before the 
15


administrative NADA is filed, the CVM is committed under its user fee agreements to reviewing and acting on 90% of administrative NADAs within 60 days after submission. The CVM user fee goal is to review and act on 90% of non-administrative NADAs within 180 days after submission. After approval, we will be required to collect reports of adverse events and submit them on a regular basis to the FDA.

Regulatory Process at the USDA 
To begin the development process for veterinary biologics products in the United States, we typically file an Application for United States Veterinary Biological Product License with the USDA. For the biologics products that we develop, we may then meet with the USDA to reach a general agreement on the plans for providing the data necessary to fulfill requirements for an approval. During development, we gather and submit data on manufacturing, purity and potency to the USDA for review. Once all data have been submitted and reviewed, the USDA will issue its decision. Unlike the FDA, there are no timelines specified by law for the USDA’s review. 
In some cases, it may be unclear whether our product candidates meet the definition of a biological product subject to regulation by the USDA or a drug subject to regulation by the FDA. The USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics and the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine have a memorandum of understanding concerning their joint responsibilities for resolving jurisdictional issues over products of this nature. Under the memorandum of understanding, animal products are to be regulated by the USDA as biologics if they are intended for use to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease in animals and they work primarily through an immune process, or by the FDA as drugs, if they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of animal disease if the primary mechanism of action is not immunological or is undefined. There is a process to gain a jurisdiction decision. 
Regulatory Process at the EMA 
The EMA is responsible for coordinating scientific evaluation of applications for marketing approval for pet therapeutics in the EU. Its veterinary review section is distinct from the review section for human drugs. To perform these evaluations the EMA established a specific scientific committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ("CVMP"). The CVMP considers applications submitted by companies for the marketing approval of individual pet therapeutics and evaluates whether or not the medicines meet the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements. Assessments conducted by the CVMP are based on scientific criteria and are intended to ensure that pet therapeutics reaching the marketplace have a positive benefit-risk balance in the pet population for which they are intended. Based on the CVMP’s recommendation, a centralized marketing authorization is granted by the EMA, which allows the product to be marketed in any of the EU states, Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland. The CVMP is also responsible for various post-authorization and maintenance activities, including the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. 
To obtain authorization from the EMA, we must submit a marketing authorization application called a dossier. The dossier is the EMA’s equivalent of the FDA’s NADA and includes data from studies showing the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. The CVMP reviews and evaluates the dossier. For any dossier, a rapporteur and co-rapporteur are appointed from the members of the CVMP. Their role is to lead the scientific evaluation and prepare the assessment report. The rapporteur can utilize experts to assist it in performing its assessment. The report is critiqued by the co-rapporteur and other members of the CVMP before the CVMP makes its determination. The final opinion of the CVMP is generally given within 210 days of the submission of a dossier, but the EMA makes the final decision on the approval of products. In general, the requirements for regulatory approval of an animal health product in the EU are similar to those in the United States, requiring demonstrated evidence of purity, safety, efficacy and consistency of manufacturing processes. 
Alternatively, product approval applications may be submitted directly to the regulatory authority in each country rather than by centralized approval by the EMA. 
Regulatory Processes at the DEA 
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. An animal 
16


drug may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Certain of our product candidates are likely to be scheduled as controlled substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use will be subject to a high degree of regulation. 
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. 
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports must be made to the DEA, for example, distribution reports for Schedule II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports. 
In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. 
Other Regulatory Considerations 
Regulatory rules relating to human food safety, food additives, or drug residues in food will not apply to the products we currently are developing because our products are not intended for use in food animals or food production animals, with the exception of horses, which qualify as food animals in Europe and Canada. 
Advertising and promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in the United States and other countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and authorized by the applicable agency. We will conduct a review of advertising and promotional material for compliance with local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell pet therapeutics.

While small molecule product drugs may eventually face generic competition in the United States, there is no pathway for approval of a generic veterinary biologic regulated by the USDA.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2019, we had 156 employees, including 29 employees with D.V.M., M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of our employees, 73, including Dr. Chin and Ms. Bevers, are engaged in one or more aspects of our research and development activities. Dr. Chin and Ms. Bevers also are engaged in corporate and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
On March 16, 2020, KindredBio announced a reduction in our workforce of approximately 53 people as we further prioritizes biologics programs for dogs and cats, and substantially reduces its commercial footprint to rely primarily on a partnership focused commercialization model. The eliminated positions primarily relate to the companion animal sales force and research and development for small molecule programs.
