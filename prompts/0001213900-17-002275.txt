ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
  We are a technology company focused on providing sustainable and cost-effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector. As an American manufacturer we design and build high performance battery-electric electric vehicles and aircraft that make movement of people and goods more efficient and less harmful to the environment. As part of our solution, we also develop cloud-based, real-time telematics performance monitoring systems that enable fleet operators to optimize energy and route efficiency. Although we operate as a single unit through our subsidiaries, we approach our development through two divisions, Automotive and Aviation. 
Automotive
 
Medium-Duty Delivery Vehicles 
 
Medium-duty electric delivery vans are currently in production and are in use by our customers on U.S. roads. Our delivery customers include companies such as UPS, FedEx Express and Alpha Baking. Data from our in-house developed telematics system demonstrates our vehicles on the road are averaging approximately a 500% increase in fuel economy as compared to conventional gasoline-based trucks of the same size and duty cycle.
 
In addition to improved fuel economy, we are anticipating that the performance of our vehicles on-route will reduce long-term vehicle maintenance expense by approximately 50% as compared to fossil-fueled trucks.
 
We estimate that our E-GEN Range-Extended Electric delivery vans will save over $150,000 in fuel and maintenance savings over the 20-year life of the vehicle. Due to the positive return-on-investment we are able to command a premium price for our vehicles from major fleet buyers. Fleet buyers are able to achieve a four-year or better return-on-investment (without government incentives), which justifies the higher acquisition cost of our vehicles.
 
We believe that we are the only medium-duty battery-electric OEM in the U.S. Our goal is to continue to increase sales and production to a point that will allow us to achieve gross margin profitability of the delivery van platform.
 
Our battery-electric delivery vans provide customers with additional benefits, including:
 

● | Low Total Cost-of-Ownership

In March of 2013, we purchased the former Workhorse Custom Chassis assembly plant in Union City, Indiana from Navistar International (NAV: NYSE). With this acquisition, we acquired the capability to be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of Class 3-6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck chassis, to be marketed under the Workhorse® brand.

The Workhorse Custom Chassis acquisition includes other important assets including the Workhorse brand and logo, intellectual property, schematics, logistical support from Up-Time Parts (a Navistar subsidiary) and access to a network of 400-plus sales and service outlets across North America. We believe the combination of our assembly capability, coupled with our battery-electric product development expertise gives Workhorse a unique opportunity to manufacture at scale in the U.S.
 
W-15 Pickup Truck
 
The success of our value selling equation to fleet buyers of medium-duty vehicles encouraged us to bring this same philosophy to the much higher volume segment of light-duty trucks. Our first product offering in the light-duty truck environment is our W-15 Range-Extended Electric Pickup Truck, which is presently under development.
 
To date, we have received letters of intent for 2,150 W-15 pickup trucks from fleets. We plan on unveiling a working concept version of the W-15 at the Advanced Clean Transportation conference in Long Beach, CA on May 1, 2017.
 
To capture further efficiencies and economies-of-scale we are designing our light-duty vehicles to take advantage of our existing supply chain repurposing the use of the critical components such as Panasonic Li-ion cells, the BMW engines as our range extender, our in-house developed vehicle control system software and our Metron Telematics performance monitoring system. In addition, we are also using composite carbon fiber body panels on the W-15 which dramatically reduce our tooling costs, reduce vehicle weight and are completely rustproof.
 
To realize further efficiencies, we intend to assemble the W-15 at our existing 250,000 square foot facility in Union City, Indiana. This plant has the capability to produce 60,000 vehicles per year. The battery packs will be built in our Loveland, Ohio battery pack plant which also serves as our corporate headquarters.
 
Post Office Replenishment Program
 
Workhorse, with our partner VT Hackney, is one of five awardees that the United States Postal Service selected to build prototype vehicles for USPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicle project. The Post Office has stated that the number of vehicles to be replaced in the project is approximately 180,000. We are on track to deliver our prototypes to the USPS by the September 2017 deadline. The Post Office has stated that they intend to test the prototypes for six months and select a winning bid(s) following the testing process. We have designed our Post Office truck such that it can be built on the same line as the W-15 in Union City, Indiana.
Aviation
 
Delivery Drones
 
Our HorseFly Delivery Drone is a custom designed, purpose-built drone that is fully integrated in our electric trucks. We have a patent pending on this architecture and we believe we are the only company in the world with a working drone/truck system. The HorseFly delivery drone and truck system is designed to work within the FAA Rule 107 that permits the use of commercial drones in U.S. airspace under certain conditions.
 
UPS conducted a successful real world test with us in February 2017 and it received worldwide news coverage. The knowledge we have gained in building electric delivery trucks for last-mile delivery has led us to believe that a drone/truck delivery system can have significant cost savings in the parcel delivery ecosphere.
 
As stated in UPS’s press release issued on February 21, 2017, a reduction of just one mile per driver per day over one year can save UPS up to $50 million. Rural delivery routes are the most expensive to serve due to the time and vehicle expenses required to complete each delivery. In this test, the drone made one delivery while the driver continued down the road to make another. This is a possible role UPS envisions for drones in the future.

Manned Multicopter
 
We are leveraging our knowledge of high-voltage battery packs, electric motor controls and range extending generators to design a multi-copter that can carry a pilot and passenger.  Several companies are now developing similar aircraft; however, we believe that our range-extended truck experience combined with our technical aviation development experience will give us competitive advantages and speed-to-market with such an aircraft.
Technology
 
Batteries Are Key
 The battery pack is key to the design, development, and manufacture of advanced electric-vehicle power trains. Where some other EV manufacturers purchase their batteries in a plug-and-play pack, we build our own battery packs. This keeps the intellectual property related to the design and production of the pack in-house and avoids the issues that occur when a battery supplier fails. And it also enables us to pay less for our batteries and pack than do our competitors thus our all-electric truck is less expensive than competitive vehicles. We use the Panasonic or LG Chem 18650 cells and design the pack around these commodity cells.
 
In-House Software Development is Essential
 Our power trains encompass the complete motor assemblies, computers, and software required for vehicle electrification. We use off-the-shelf, proven components and combine them with our proprietary software.
 
Innovation is the Future 
 Additionally, we have developed a cloud-based, remote management system to manage and track the performance of all of the vehicles that we deploy in order to provide a 21st Century solution for fleet managers.

The telematics system and associated hardware installed the Workhorse vehicles is designed to monitor the CAN network traffic for specific signals. These signals are uploaded along with GPS data to a Workhorse server facility where the data signals are tracked at ten (10) second intervals while driving and during the E-GEN electricity generating process and at sixty (60) seconds during a plug-in charge. The real-time data is stored in a database as it arrives and delivers updates to clients connected through the web interface.

Clients are given login credentials (username and password) to the telematics website where they can monitor the performance and location of the vehicles. Group privileges can be configured to limit access to client-specific vehicles securing the vehicle data so clients can only view their vehicle data. Administrator privileges allow all data for all clients to be monitored and viewed.
 
As a parameter-based system, we can set route-specific parameters to better manage the battery-provided power with the additional power generated through the E-GEN process (not applicable to E-100). In an upcoming release, we will add the ability to integrate Metron Telematics with the client’s internal telematics system and automatically update the parameters each day with information about the route. This enhancement will result in a “SMART-GEN” vehicle that will maximize efficiency by automating the process to determine the ideal times and locations to use the E-GEN to add electricity to the batteries.
 
Locations and Facilities
 
Our company headquarters and R & D facility is located at 100 Commerce Drive, Loveland, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb. We occupy a 45,500 sq. ft. facility that allows for the manufacture of 1,000 electric power train kits per year. Power trains will be delivered to the Workhorse facility in Indiana or shipped to our dealer network for onsite installation in conversion vehicles. On October 28, 2016 the Company purchased its operating facilities in Loveland, Ohio. The total purchase price was $2.5 million with $1.7 million financed with a financial institution. The note carries an interest rate of 6.5% accruing monthly with a maturity date of January 1, 2027.
Workhorse Group Inc. Location 
 
Our truck assembly facility is located in Union City, Indiana. This facility consists of three buildings with 270,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space on 46 acres.
Workhorse Facility
 
In March of 2013, we purchased the former Workhorse Custom Chassis assembly plant in Union City, Indiana. With this acquisition, we became an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of Class 3-6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck chassis to be marketed under the Workhorse® brand.

Ownership and operation of this plant enables us to build new chassis with gross vehicle weight capacity of between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds and to offer them in four different fuel variants—electric, gas, propane, and CNG. We plan to offer well- known Workhorse chassis as well as a new, 88” track W88 truck chassis that will be offered to fleet purchasing managers at price points that are both attractive and cost competitive.
 
At the same time, the Company intends to partner with engine suppliers and body fabricators to offer fleet-specific, custom, purpose-built chassis that provide total cost of ownership solutions that are superior to the competition.
 
In addition to building our own chassis, we design and produce battery-electric power trains that can be installed in new Workhorse chassis or installed as repower packages to convert used Class 3-6 medium-duty vehicles from diesel or gasoline power to electric power. Our approach is to provide battery-electric power trains utilizes proven, automotive-grade, mass-produced parts in its architecture coupled with in-house control software that it has developed over the last five years.
 
The Workhorse Custom Chassis acquisition includes other important assets including the Workhorse brand and logo, intellectual property, schematics, logistical support from UpTime Parts (a Navistar subsidiary) and, perhaps most importantly, a network of 400 plus sales and service outlets across North America. We believe the combination of Workhorse’s chassis assembly capability, coupled with its ability to offer an array of fuel choices, gives Workhorse a unique opportunity in the marketplace.
 
Marketing
 
Our sales team is focused on a targeted list of high profile, former purchasers, and current buyers of the Workhorse chassis with the goal of securing purchase orders from these companies. These purchase orders will give us the first look at next year’s chassis demand related to electric and extended range electric vehicles.
 
Our priority is to establish the commercial step van as our core business. We intend to be the best choice for a vehicle in this segment regardless of the fuel type that the customer chooses. Our sales plan is to meet with the top potential customers and obtain purchase orders for new electric and extended range electric vehicles for their production vehicle requirements.
 
Finally, since our competitive advantage in the marketplace is our ability to provide purpose-built solutions to customers that have unique requirements at relatively low-volume, we have submitted proposals to companies for purpose-built vehicle applications.

Strategic Relationships
 
Panasonic: Workhorse Group has signed an agreement with the rechargeable battery division of Panasonic Industrial Devices Sales Co. of America for the supply of “18650” cylindrical Panasonic lithium-ion batteries for Workhorse’s battery-electric, medium-duty trucks.
 
Morgan Olsen, Utilimaster, ECO, and other up-fitters or body fabricators: All of these companies build bodies customized for the needs of their customers and mated to chassis that are available to them from the short list of chassis suppliers. The functionality and configuration the end-user receives in the finished product is limited by the available chassis/powertrain. Workhorse will work with these organizations to provide chassis that not only best fit the needs of the end user customer but also provide the customer with a competitive advantage in their specific industry or application.
 
Research and Development
 
The majority of our research and development is conducted in-house at our facilities near Cincinnati, Ohio. Additionally, we contract with engineering firms to assist with validation and certification requirements as well as specific vehicle integration tasks.
Competitive Companies
 
The medium-duty commercial vehicle market is highly competitive and we expect it to become even more so in the future as additional companies launch competing vehicle offerings. The medium-duty commercial alternatively fueled vehicle market, however, is less developed and competitive. There are two primary competitors in the medium-duty vehicle segment in the US market:  Ford and Freightliner.  Neither has disclosed any plans to offer 100% EV or EREV vehicles in this segment. Ford is vertically integrated building a complete vehicle or chassis including Ford engine and transmission.  They provide a chassis as a strip-chassis (which is similar to the Workhorse product) or they provide it with a cab. Freightliner provides a chassis as a strip-chassis, which is similar to the Workhorse Truck chassis.
 
We believe the most dramatic difference between Workhorse and the other competitors in the medium duty truck market is our ability to offer customers purpose-built solutions that meet the needs of their unique requirements at a competitive price. While there are many electric car companies from abroad, there are only a few foreign companies that have vehicles in the category of medium-duty trucks.
 
We believe that the primary competitive factors within the medium-duty commercial vehicle market are:
 

● | the difference in the initial purchase prices of electric vehicles and comparable vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, both including and excluding the impact of government and other subsidies and incentives designed to promote the purchase of electric vehicles; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the total cost of vehicle ownership over the vehicle's expected life, which includes the initial purchase price and ongoing operational and maintenance costs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | vehicle quality, performance and safety; 
--+---------------------------------------------


● | government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the quality and availability of service for the vehicle, including the availability of replacement parts.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Our electric vehicles are designed to comply with a significant number of governmental regulations and industry standards, some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to our electric vehicles are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have upon our business. We believe that our vehicles are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions. 
 
Emission and fuel economy standards
 
Government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the U.S. federal and state levels. The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, issued a final rule for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy requirements for trucks and heavy-duty engines on August 9, 2011, which will have an initial phase in starting with model year 2014 and a final phase in occurring in model year 2017. NHTSA standards for model year 2014 and 2015 will be voluntary, while mandatory standards will first come into effect in 2016.
 
The rule provides emission standards for CO2 and fuel consumption standards for three main categories of vehicles: (i) combination tractors, (ii) heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans and (iii) vocational vehicles. We believe that the Workhorse chassis would be considered “vocational vehicles" under the rule. According to the EPA and NHTSA, vocational vehicles consist of a wide variety of truck and bus types, including delivery, refuse, utility, dump, cement, transit bus, shuttle bus, school bus, emergency vehicles, motor homes and tow trucks, and are characterized by a complex build process, with an incomplete chassis often built with an engine and transmission purchased from other manufacturers, then sold to a body manufacturer.
 
The EPA and NHTSA rule also establishes multiple flexibility and incentive programs for manufacturers of alternatively fueled vehicles, such as the Workhorse E-100 full electric and the E-Gen Electric, including an engine averaging, banking and trading, or ABT, program, a vehicle ABT program and additional credit programs for early adoption of standards or deployment of advanced or innovative technologies. The ABT programs will allow for emission and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged, banked or traded within defined groupings of the regulatory subcategories. The additional credit programs will allow manufacturers of engines and vehicles to be eligible to generate credits if they demonstrate improvements in excess of the standards established in the rule prior to the model year the standards become effective or if they introduce advanced or innovative technology engines or vehicles.
 
The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by CARB with respect to emissions for our vehicles. The Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act's standards and the Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles.
 
Manufacturers who sell vehicles in states covered by federal requirements under the Clean Air Act without a Certificate of Conformity may be subject to penalties of up to $37,500 per violation and be required to recall and remedy any vehicles sold with emissions in excess of Clean Air Act standards. In 2013, we received approval from CARB to sell the E-100 in California based on our own emissions tests.
 
Vehicle safety and testing
 
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, or the Safety Act, regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in the United States in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.

Battery safety and testing
 
Our battery packs conform to mandatory regulations that govern transport of "dangerous goods," which includes lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, which are issued by PHMSA, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations, and related UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. The requirements for shipments of these goods vary by mode of transportation, such as ocean vessel, rail, truck and air.
 
Our battery module suppliers have completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs demonstrating our compliance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, including:
 

● | altitude simulation, which involves simulating air transport; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | thermal cycling, which involves assessing cell and battery seal integrity; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | vibration, which involves simulating vibration during transport; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | shock, which involves simulating possible impacts during transport; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | external short circuit, which involves simulating an external short circuit; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | overcharge, which involves evaluating the ability of a rechargeable battery to withstand overcharging. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Vehicle dealer and distribution regulation
 
Certain states' laws require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in such states in order to conduct manufacturing and sales activities. To date, we are registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in Indiana and Ohio as well as a dealer in California and Chicago. We have not yet sought formal clarification of our ability to manufacture or sell our vehicles in any other states.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have five pending trademark applications and nine issued trademark registrations (US and foreign). We also intend to pursue additional foreign trademark registrations. We have two pending non-provisional U.S. patent application, one pending provisional patent application, and six existing patents, two of which are design patents. We also plan to pursue appropriate foreign patent protection on those inventions, if available. The following is a summary of our patents:
