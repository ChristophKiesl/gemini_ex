     Holdings was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on February 4, 2004 and was converted to a Delaware corporation on May 14, 2004. Our principal executive offices are located at 7250 South Tenaya Way, Suite 100, Las Vegas, Nevada 89113. Our telephone number is (800) 833-7110. Our website address is www.everi.com. The information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC.
     Impact of Merger with Everi Games Holding
     In December 2014, Holdings acquired Everi Games Holding pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 8, 2014, for total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion in cash (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, we incurred additional indebtedness and completed a series of refinancing transactions, which are described in “Note 12. Long-Term Debt” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information regarding the Merger, see “Note 3. Business Combinations” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
     The results contributed by the Everi Games business from the date of consummation of the Merger are reflected in our Games segment and Consolidated Financial Statements. Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were significantly impacted by the inclusion of the results of operations of Everi Games in our Games segment results of operations and by higher interest expense associated with the additional indebtedness incurred to finance the Merger. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 include Everi Games revenue only from the December 19, 2014 acquisition date, and, therefore, were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
     Our Business Segments
     We report our financial performance, and organize and manage our operations, across the following two business segments: (a) Games, and (b) Payments. For additional information on our segments see, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Operating Segments” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Segment Reporting” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
     A summary of our segment financial information is contained in “Note 18. Segment Information” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Our Games products and services include commercial products, such as Class III products, Native American Class II

products, and other bingo products, lottery systems, and back office systems. In our Games business, we generally retain ownership of the leased gaming equipment installed at customer facilities and receive recurring revenue based on a percentage of the net win per day generated by the leased gaming equipment or a fixed daily fee based on the number of player terminals installed at the facility. We also make direct sales of player terminals, licenses, back office systems and other related equipment to customers. The majority of these direct sales contracts are for some combination of gaming equipment, player terminals, content, system software, license fees, ancillary equipment and maintenance.
     With respect to our Games business, we have expanded our licensing into new jurisdictions, increased investment in research and development, and introduced premium game products (which typically include high definition (“HD”) dual-screens, liquid crystal display (“LCD”) panels, and red green blue (“RGB”) top box lighting). From its historical focus on placement of games into the Oklahoma and Washington tribal markets, Everi Games has diversified its installed base in recent years with entry into new commercial and tribal markets as well as the development and placement of premium products. Everi Games has grown premium game installations with approximately 1,850 units installed (representing approximately 14% of our installed base) since entering the category four years ago. Development of generally higher-earning premium games has supported Everi Games’ ability to enter new markets, expand its footprint, and provide broad and new content across its installed base.
     Everi Games provides the New York Lottery with an accounting and central determinant system for the VLTs in operation at licensed State of New York gaming facilities. As of December 31, 2016, this central determinant system connected to approximately 17,600 VLTs and has the ability to interface with, provide outcomes to, and manage the VLTs. Pursuant to its agreement with the New York Lottery, Everi Games receives a portion of the network-wide net win (generally, cash-in less prizes paid) per day in exchange for provision and maintenance of the central determinant system. In February 2009, the New York Lottery awarded Everi Games a contract extension through December 2017 and provided Everi Games an opportunity to expand its network as the New York Lottery licenses additional gaming facilities or expands existing facilities in the state. Everi Games also provides central determinant system technology to Native American tribes in the State of Washington for which it receives a portion of the revenue generated from the VLTs connected to the system.

     Payments Products and Services
     Our Payments products and services include solutions that we provide directly to gaming establishments to offer their patrons cash access related services and products including: access to cash at gaming facilities via ATM cash withdrawals, credit card cash access transactions and POS debit card cash access transactions; check-related services; fully integrated kiosks and maintenance services; compliance, audit and data software; casino credit data and reporting services and other ancillary offerings.

 The markets we address with our principal Payments products and services are:
     ATM Cash Withdrawals. ATM cash withdrawal transactions represent the largest category of electronic payment transactions that we process, as measured by dollar and transaction volume. In an ATM cash withdrawal transaction, a patron directly accesses funds from a device enabled with our ATM service by either using an ATM or debit card to withdraw funds from the patron’s demand deposit account, or using a credit card to access the patron’s line of credit. In either event, the patron must use the personal identification number (“PIN”) associated with such card. Our processor then routes the transaction request through an electronic funds transfer (“EFT”) network to the patron’s bank or issuer, as applicable. Depending upon a number of factors, including the patron’s account balance or credit limit and daily withdrawal limit (which limits are set by the bank or issuer, as applicable), the bank or issuer will either authorize or decline the transaction. If the transaction is authorized, then the ATM-enabled device dispenses the cash to the patron. For a transaction using an ATM or debit card, the patron’s demand deposit account is debited by the amount of cash disbursed plus a service fee that we assess the patron for the use of the ATM service. For a transaction using a credit card with a PIN, the patron’s credit card account is charged by the amount of the cash disbursed plus a service fee that we assess the patron for the use of the ATM service. In both cases, the service fee is currently a fixed dollar amount and not a percentage of the transaction size. We also receive a fee, which we refer to as a reverse interchange fee, from the patron’s card-issuing bank for accommodating the card issuer’s customer. In most circumstances, we pay a percentage of the service fee that we receive from the patron and, in some circumstances, a portion of the reverse interchange fees we receive, as a commission to our gaming establishment customers for the right to operate on their premises.
     Credit Card Cash Access Transactions and POS Debit Card Cash Access Transactions. Patrons can perform credit card cash access transactions and POS debit card cash access transactions using many of our enabled devices. A patron’s credit card cash access limit is usually a sub-limit of the total credit line and is set by the card-issuing bank, not Everi. These limits vary significantly and can be larger or smaller than the POS debit cash access limit. A credit card cash access transaction obligates the patron to repay the issuing bank over time on terms that are preset by the cardholder agreement. A patron’s POS debit card allows the patron to make cash withdrawals at the POS in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of funds in the account, or a daily limit that is generally five to ten times as large as the patron’s daily ATM limit. 
     When a patron requests a credit card cash access or POS debit card transaction, our processor routes the transaction request through one of the card associations, or EFT networks to the issuing bank. Depending upon several factors, such as the available credit or bank account balance, the transaction is either authorized or declined by the issuing bank. If authorized, the patron’s bank account is debited or the patron’s credit card balance is increased, in both cases, by an amount equal to the funds requested plus our service fee. The service fee is a fixed dollar amount, a percentage of the transaction size or a combination of a fixed dollar amount and percentage of the transaction size. If the transaction is authorized, the device informs the patron that the transaction has been approved. The device then further instructs the patron to proceed to the gaming establishment’s cashier, or Company-operated satellite cage (“financial services center”), to complete the transaction because credit card cash access and POS debit card cash access transactions must, in most circumstances, be completed in face-to-face environments and a unique signature must be received in order to comply with rules of the card associations. Once at the gaming establishment’s cashier or at our financial services center, the patron acknowledges acceptance of the fee. We reimburse the gaming establishment for the amount of cash that it provided to the patron by paying the gaming establishment via wire transfer or other similar form of electronic payment. In addition, we generally pay the gaming establishment a portion of the service fee as a commission for the right to operate on its premises, although this payment as a percentage of the fee is generally smaller for credit card cash access and POS debit card cash access transactions than for ATM withdrawals. In addition, we are obligated to pay interchange fees to the issuing bank and processing costs related to the electronic payment transaction to card associations.
     Check-Related Services. Patrons are able to cash checks at certain gaming establishments. When a patron presents a check to the cashier, the gaming establishment can accept or deny the transaction based on its own customer information and at its own risk, obtain third-party verification information about the check writer, the bank account number and other information relating to the check to manage its risk, or obtain a warranty on payment of the check, which entitles the gaming establishment to reimbursement of the full face amount of the check if it is dishonored.
     If a gaming establishment chooses to have a check warranted, it sends a request to a check warranty service provider, inquiring whether it would be willing to accept the risk of cashing the check. If the check warranty provider accepts the risk and warrants the check, the gaming establishment negotiates the patron’s check by providing cash for the face amount 

 
  8

 
of the check. If the check is dishonored by the patron’s bank upon presentment, the gaming establishment invokes the warranty, and the check warranty service provider purchases the check from the gaming establishment for the full check amount and then pursues collection activities on its own.
     For those gaming establishments that seek to manage their own risk, we provide a subscription check verification service via a database operated by our subsidiary, Central Credit, LLC (“Central Credit”), which is used by gaming establishments to make credit issuing decisions. Central Credit maintains information on the check cashing and credit history of many gaming establishment patrons. For those gaming establishments that prefer to obtain a warranty, we currently provide check warranty services through a third-party check warranty service provider. We pay this third-party provider to assist with the warranty decision, check processing, billing and collection activities. On our behalf, this third-party provider charges our gaming establishment customers a fee for the check warranty services, which is typically a percentage of the face amount of the check being warranted. In such circumstances, we receive all of the check warranty revenue. We are exposed to risk for the losses associated with any warranted items that cannot be collected from patrons issuing the items. Warranty expenses are defined as any amounts paid by the third-party provider to gaming establishments to purchase dishonored checks that will not be collectible from patrons and any expenses related to the collection on these amounts. We also pay certain fees and operating expenses to our third-party provider related to the provision of these services.
     Our principal Payments products and services consist of the following:
     Casino Cash Plus 3-in-1 ATMs are unmanned, cash-dispensing machines that enable ATM cash withdrawals, POS debit card cash access transactions, and credit card cash access transactions directly, or using our patented 3-in-1 Rollover functionality. Most financial institutions that issue debit cards impose daily ATM withdrawal limits, and, in some instances, aggregate and count Friday, Saturday and Sunday as a single day in calculating such limits. If a patron has reached his or her daily ATM limit, our patented 3-in-1 Rollover functionality automatically enables the patron to obtain funds via a POS debit card transaction or a credit card cash access transaction instead.
     Check verification and warranty services allow gaming establishments to manage and reduce risk on patron checks that they cash. A gaming establishment can query our Central Credit database to review the check cashing history of a gaming establishment patron before deciding whether to cash the patron’s check. If the gaming establishment desires additional protection against loss, it can seek a warranty on payment of the check. We have a relationship with a third-party check warranty service provider to market check warranty services to gaming establishments.
     CashClub® provides gaming establishments with a single dashboard interface that streamlines credit and debit card cash access transaction processing and check warranty transactions. It allows for electronic signature capture and dynamic currency conversion. It also interfaces with Everi Compliance to meet Title 31 regulatory requirements.
     Fully Integrated Kiosks are a complete line of products that provide multiple functions to the casino floor. This includes cash access functionality, such as our 3-in-1 Rollover, which provides casino patrons access to perform cash advance, POS debit and ATM transactions. The kiosks also provide functionality to perform check cashing transactions, slot machine ticket redemption, bill breaking and loyalty program access as well as integration with mobile and wallet technology. The availability of our cash access platform on these slot ticket redemption devices provides us with additional points of contact with gaming patrons at locations that are usually closer to gaming devices than traditional cash access devices that are typically located on the periphery of the gaming area within the casino floor and also provides gaming patrons with more opportunities to access their cash with less cashier involvement.
     Other Integrated Kiosk Solutions provide casinos with more efficient and streamlined methods for cash handling and transaction processing. They allow casino personnel to immediately process and dispense taxable jackpots in the form of cash, tickets or a combination of both. They also help to improve cage security and accuracy while reducing count and balancing times. These products are designed to be integrated with our suite of cage compliance software to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and provide an automated way to process common tax forms such as the Internal Revenue Service Form W-2G or Form 1042-S.
     Central Credit is our gaming patron credit bureau service which, on a subscription basis, allows gaming establishments to improve their credit-granting decisions by obtaining access to a database containing credit information and transaction data on millions of gaming patrons. Our gaming credit reports are comprised of information recorded from patron credit histories at hundreds of gaming establishments. We provide such information to gaming establishments that subscribe to 

 
  9

 
the service. These establishments then use that data, among other things, to determine how much credit, if any, they will grant to a gaming patron. We typically charge our customers for access to gaming patron credit reports on a monthly basis and our fees are generally comprised of a fixed minimum fee plus per-transaction charges for certain requests.
     Everi Compliance is our suite of compliance software offerings for gaming operators. These compliance solutions help our gaming establishment customers comply with financial services and gaming regulations. These compliance solutions include software to assist with anti-money laundering regulations, such as filing currency transaction reports by casinos (“CTRCs”) and suspicious activity reports (“SARs”). Additionally, these compliance solutions also assist casinos in filing required tax forms in connection with the payout of jackpot winnings to patrons and assist casinos with auditing cash on the floor and in casino cages.
     We also offer:
    
· | Stand alone, non-ATM terminals that perform authorizations for credit card cash access and POS debit card cash access transactions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Database services that allow gaming establishments access to information from our proprietary patron transaction database for purposes of player acquisition, direct marketing, market share analysis, and a variety of other patron promotional uses. Our proprietary patron transaction database includes information that is captured from transactions we process. Patrons may “opt out” of having their names included in marketing mailing lists.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An online payment processing solution for gaming operators in states that offer intra-state, Internet-based gaming and lottery activities.

      Manufacturing
     We utilize contract manufacturers to produce the cabinets that make up our EGMs and our kiosk products, as well as other sub-assemblies. We have assembly facilities in Austin, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada, where we assemble the EGMs and our kiosk products, which include the cabinets, computer assemblies, LCD screens, printers, bill validators and acceptors, and other wiring and harnesses. We believe that our sources of supply of component parts and raw materials for our products are generally adequate and we have few sole-sourced parts.     Research and Development
     We conduct research and development activities primarily to develop gaming systems, gaming engines, casino data management systems, casino central monitoring systems, video lottery outcome determination systems, gaming platforms and gaming content, as well as to add enhancements to our existing product lines. We believe our ability to deliver differentiated, appealing products and services to the marketplace is based on our research and development investments, and we expect to continue to make such investments in the future. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits, consulting fees and game lab testing fees. Once the technological feasibility of a project has been established, it is transferred from research to development and capitalization of development costs begins until the product is available for general release.     Customers
     As of December 31, 2016, we served over 1,000 casinos and other gaming properties in the United States, Europe, Canada, the Caribbean, Central America and Asia. In certain limited circumstances, we provide our products and services to non-gaming establishments, such as gas stations and other retail businesses associated with gaming establishment customers. However, the revenue generated from these operations is not material to our operations and we do not actively market or target non-gaming establishment customers.     Sales and Marketing
     We sell and market our products and services to gaming establishments primarily through the use of a direct sales force, which targets gaming establishments in the United States and in international markets. With respect to our gaming 

 
  10

 
products, we participate in the Class III and Class II gaming machine markets, as well as the central determinant system market in North America, through participation, or revenue share, and fixed fee arrangements and the sale of proprietary EGMs and systems. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our revenues from our operations outside the United States were 3.7%, 2.9%, and 2.7% of our total revenue, respectively. All of our long-lived assets outside of the United States were immaterial for each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014.
     In our Payments business, we sell and market Cash Access (Cash Advance, ATM and Check Services), fully integrated Kiosks, Everi Compliance and Central Credit services. Approximately 96% of our revenues are earned from North American sources while the remaining 4% is derived internationally.
     Our sales and marketing efforts are directed by a team of customer service executives, each of whom has business development responsibility for gaming establishments in specified geographic regions. These customer service executives direct their efforts at all levels of gaming establishment personnel, including senior executives, finance professionals, marketing staff, slot directors, and cashiers, and seek to educate them on the benefits of our products and services. In some cases, our customer service executives are supported by field service and account managers, who provide on-site customer service to most of our customers. In other cases, our sales executives directly maintain the customer relationships. These customer service executives and field service and account managers generally reside in the vicinity of the specific gaming establishments that they support to ensure that they respond to the customer service needs of those gaming establishments. We also have joint sales efforts with a number of strategic partners, including independent sales organizations, which allow us to market our products and services to gaming establishments through channels other than our direct sales force.
     Competition
     In our Games business, we compete across different gaming markets with a variety of gaming equipment suppliers. Competition is generally based upon the (a) amount of revenue our products generate for our customers relative to the amount of revenue generated by our competitors’ products, (b) prices and/or fees we and our competitors charge for products and services offered, and (c) appeal of our competitors’ products to gaming patrons, which has a direct effect on the volume of play generated by a product and, accordingly, the revenues generated for our customers. To drive customer demand and improve product attractiveness to end users, we continually work to develop new game themes, gaming engines, hardware platforms and systems that appeal to gaming patrons, all while working to release these new products to the marketplace in a timely manner.
     In our Payments business, we compete with other providers of cash access services to the gaming industry, as well as with financial institutions and other regional and local banks that operate ATMs on the premises of gaming establishments. Some of these other providers and financial institutions have established cooperative relationships with each other to expand their service offerings. We also face increased competition from (a) independent sales organizations, which provide basic services and aggressive pricing, (b) other manufacturers that provide similar good and services, and (c) traditional transaction processors that have entered the gaming patron cash access services market. This increased competition amongst these various providers of cash access services has resulted in pricing pressure and margin erosion with respect to our core cash access products and services.
     Proprietary Rights
     We believe the ability to introduce and respond to technological innovation in the gaming industry will be an increasingly important qualification for the future success of any provider of cash access and gaming-related products and services. Our continued competitiveness will depend on (a) the pace of our new product development, (b) our patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection, and (c) our relationships with customers. Our business development personnel work with gaming establishments, our technology and other strategic partners, and the suppliers of the financial services upon which our cash access services rely, to design and develop innovative products and services that appeal to gaming patrons.
     We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. In our business, we have over 250 patents issued related to games and systems and processes, and have more than 50 patent applications pending world-wide. The expiration dates of these patents vary and are based on their filing and issuances dates. We intend to continue to actively file for patent protection, when such filings are 

 
  11

 
commercially reasonable, within and outside the United States. We also seek trademark protection for our names and products and have registered hundreds of trademarks in the United States and various foreign countries. Under permission or license agreements with third parties, we also sell gaming products covered by independently filed copyrights, trademarks and/or patents. Typically, these contracts require us to pay royalties to the licensing party. Royalty expenses are included in the cost of gaming and systems in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our patents, trademarks, and copyrights, we also rely on a broader scope of intellectual property including trade secrets, in-house know-how and innovation.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 900 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We have never experienced a work stoppage and none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.     Available Information

We make available free of charge on our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition, our earnings conference calls are web cast live via our website.

 REGULATION
 Gaming Regulation
     The gaming industry is highly regulated under legal systems that frequently evolve and change based on governmental public policies. Various aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive laws, regulations and ordinances applicable to the ownership, management and operation of gambling establishments as well as certain financial services conducted at such establishments. These gaming laws, regulations and ordinances require us to be licensed, registered, found suitable, qualified or otherwise approved by various city, county, state, provincial, federal, tribal and foreign government agencies (collectively, “Gaming Authorities”) in the jurisdictions where we conduct business.  We must maintain those licenses, registrations, or other approvals in good standing to continue our business, which generally imposes certain (i) financial and operational reporting, and oversight requirements, and (ii) character and fitness suitability requirements, in each case administered by the Gaming Authorities, upon us and our affiliated or subsidiary organizations, as well as the officers, directors, key personnel and, in certain instances, holders of our debt and/or equity securities in each of those organizations, and our material business associates. Gaming Authorities have broad discretion in determining whether to grant a license, registration or other approval.  Subject to complying with certain procedural requirements, Gaming Authorities may deny any application, or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability, qualification or other approval for any cause deemed reasonable to them.  
     In general, the licensure, qualification and approval requirements and the regulations imposed on non-gaming suppliers and vendors are less stringent than those requirements and regulations imposed on gaming operators, gaming-related manufacturers and suppliers.  However, some jurisdictions do not distinguish between non-gaming and gaming suppliers and vendors while other jurisdictions classify all of our products and services as gaming-related.  In those jurisdictions which classify our products and services as gaming-related, we are subject to the more stringent licensing and regulatory framework. The stated policies and other purposes behind such laws, regulations, and ordinances are generally to: (i) ensure the public’s trust and confidence in legalized gambling through a system of mandated regulation, internal controls, accounting practices, and operating procedures, and (ii) promote economic activity for the state, county and local governments through revenue opportunities emanating from taxes, licensing fees, and other economic benefits arising out of gambling and related activities. 
     Moreover, our gaming devices and certain other products and technologies must be certified or approved by Gaming Authorities in many jurisdictions where we conduct business.  These Gaming Authorities test the gaming devices, systems, and related equipment directly or through an independent testing laboratory and may also require a field trial under the regulator’s technical standards before allowing us to sell the product. Although we collaborate closely with the Gaming Authorities and independent testing laboratories, we cannot control whether our products will be approved or the length of time taken to review our products for sale to third parties.
     We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material gaming and financial institution laws applicable to our business.  We can give no assurance, however, that our business activities or the activities of our customers in the gaming industry will not be subject to any regulatory or legal enforcement proceedings in the future and a violation of applicable gaming laws by us or any of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Depending on the nature of any noncompliance, our failure to comply with such laws, regulations, and ordinances may result in the suspension or revocation of any license, registration, or other approval, a partial or complete cessation of our business, seizure of our assets, as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.

 A description of the material regulations to which we are subject is set forth below.
     Federal Regulation. At the federal level, we are subject to two key pieces of legislation. Our Native American customers are regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission (“NIGC”), which was established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (the “IGRA”). The NIGC has regulatory authority over certain aspects of Native American gaming and defines the boundaries of our dealings with the Native American marketplace and the level of regulatory authority to which these games are subject. IGRA establishes three classes of gaming, each with a different regulatory framework:
    
Class | Type of Games | Regulatory Oversight 
I | Social gaming for minimal prizes and traditional Indian gaming. | Exclusive regulation and oversight by tribal governments. 
II | Bingo (both in traditional and electronic form). | Regulation by tribal governments with NIGC oversight. 
III | Casino style games (including slot machines, blackjack, craps and roulette). | Must be permitted by the state in which the tribe is located. The state and the tribe must have negotiated a compact approved by NIGC, and the tribe must have adopted a gaming ordinance approved by the NIGC.

      We sell our gaming devices and systems in both Class II and Class III markets.
     The Johnson Act, as amended by the Federal Gambling Devices Act of 1962 (the “Johnson Act”), requires that we register annually with the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice and requires a wide variety of record keeping and equipment identification efforts on our part. Registration is required in order for us to sell, distribute, manufacture, transport, and/or receive gaming equipment, machines or components across state lines. If we fail to comply with the requirements set forth under the Johnson Act, we could become subject to a variety of penalties, including, but not limited to, the seizure and forfeiture of equipment.
     State and Tribal Gaming Commissions. We are regulated by gaming commissions or similar authorities at the state or tribal level as either a (i) manufacturer of gaming devices, in those jurisdictions where we manufacture gaming devices and systems, (ii) supplier of “associated equipment,” in those jurisdictions where we sell and service fully integrated kiosks and other integrated kiosk solutions, and/or (ii) non-gaming supplier or vendor, in those jurisdictions where we provide cash access and Central Credit services only.
     The process of obtaining necessary licenses, registrations, or other approvals often involves substantial disclosure of confidential or proprietary information about us and our officers, directors, key personnel and, in certain instances, beneficial owners of our debt and/or equity securities, and requires a determination by the regulators as to our suitability as a manufacturer, supplier, or vendor to gaming establishments. Such suitability examinations may also generally include the following:
    
· | requiring the licensure or finding of suitability of any of our officers, directors, key employees, or beneficial owners of our debt and/or equity securities as well as our key third-party vendors, suppliers, customers, and other companies with whom we conduct business;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the termination or disassociation with such officer, director, key employee, or beneficial owner of our securities that fails to file an application or to obtain a license or finding of suitability and prohibiting unapproved payments and distributions to such persons;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission of detailed financial and operating reports;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission of reports of material loans, leases, sales of securities, and financings; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the regulatory approval of certain material transactions, such as the merger with or acquisition of other companies, the transfer or pledge of our stock or other equity interests or restrictions on transfer of such interests, or similar financing transactions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     These regulatory obligations are imposed upon gaming-related manufacturers, suppliers, or vendors on an ongoing basis, and there are no guaranties that we will be successful in obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals and to continue to hold other necessary gaming licenses, permits, and approvals to conduct our businesses as currently being conducted by us. The expansion of our businesses, the introduction of new games, systems, products or services, or changes to applicable rules and regulations may result in additional regulatory or licensing requirements being imposed upon us. Many Gaming Authorities will require us to submit software and other key technology components of our gaming devices and systems, as well as our fully integrated kiosks and other integrated kiosk solutions, to government or third-party gaming laboratories for testing and certification prior to deploying such games, systems, and devices in a particular gaming jurisdiction.
     Gaming regulatory authorities have broad discretion and may require any beneficial holder of our securities, regardless of the number of shares of common stock and/or amount of debt securities owned, to file an application, make personal or confidential disclosures, be investigated, and be subject to a determination of suitability. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and, in some jurisdictions, non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to Gaming Authorities, and Gaming Authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability, subject to limited exceptions for “institutional investors” that hold a company’s voting securities for investment purposes only. If a beneficial holder of our securities is a corporation, partnership, or trust, such entity must submit detailed business and financial information, which may include information regarding its officers, directors, partners, key personnel, and beneficial owners. Further disclosure by those officers, directors, partners, key personnel, and beneficial owners may also be required. Under some circumstances and in some jurisdictions, an institutional investor, as defined in the applicable gaming regulations, that acquires and holds a specified amount of our securities in the ordinary course of its business may apply to the regulatory authority for a waiver of these licensure, qualification, or finding of suitability requirements, provided that the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only, meets certain thresholds relating to the number of securities held, and certifies as to its intentions not to directly or indirectly exert control or influence over the management, policies, and operations of the licensed entity or to change its corporate governance documents. 
     Tribal-State Compacts and Tribal Regulation. Native American gaming is subject to the review of the NIGC and other applicable laws. Native American tribes must adopt and submit for NIGC approval the ordinances that regulate their gaming activities. Pursuant to the requirements of IGRA, our tribal customers require the tribe to have the sole proprietary interest in their gaming activities. Because federally recognized Native American tribes are independent governments with sovereign rights, Native American tribes can enact their own laws and regulate gaming operations and contracts, and, with some exceptions, generally enjoy sovereign immunity from lawsuits similar to that of the individual states and the United States.
     Class III gaming on Native American tribal lands is subject to the negotiation of a compact between the tribe and the state in which they plan to operate a gaming facility. These tribal-state compacts typically include provisions entitling the state to receive a portion of the tribe’s gaming revenues. While tribal-state compacts are intended to document the agreement between the state and a tribe, these tribal-state compacts can be subject to disputes relative to permitted Class III gaming operations. 
     Charity Regulation. We have historically supplied bingo games and systems to nonprofit organizations that operate these games for charitable, educational and other lawful purposes. Bingo for charity is not subject to a nationwide regulatory system, such as the system created by IGRA to regulate Native American gaming, and, as a result, regulation for this market is generally on a state-by-state basis, although in some cases it is regulated by county commissions or other local government authorities.

 Lottery Commissions. Most states and the District of Columbia have lotteries. The operation of lotteries is subject to extensive regulation. Many aspects of lottery operations are determined by state or local legislation, but lottery regulatory authorities exercise significant discretion to ensure the integrity of contract awards and lottery operations, including in the process of selecting suppliers of equipment, technology and services and retailers of lottery products.  Lottery regulatory commissions typically require detailed background disclosure by and investigations of vendors and their subsidiaries, affiliates, principal stockholders, officers, directors, and employees who will be directly responsible for the operation of lottery systems.  These regulators may have authority to order removal of employees who they deem to be unsuitable or whose presence they believe may adversely affect the operational security or integrity of the lottery. Some lottery commissions mandate extensive personal and financial disclosure and background checks from persons and entities beneficially owning a specified percentage (typically 5% or more) of a vendor's securities. The failure of such beneficial owners of our securities to cooperate with the regulators could result in penalties, jeopardize the award of a lottery contract to us, or provide grounds for termination of an existing lottery contract.
     Internet and Online Gaming Regulation. Several states have passed implementing legislation and/or regulations to allow certain intra-state, wager-based, online casino and/or lottery games, such as online poker, lottery ticket purchases, or lottery ticket subscriptions. This is due, in part, to (a) a rule of construction contained within the Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act (“UIGEA”) that limits and prevents UIGEA application from altering, limiting or extending any federal, state or tribal laws regulating gambling, (b) a definition within UIGEA that excludes certain intra-state, intra-tribal and interstate horseracing transactions from the phrase “unlawful Internet gambling,” provided certain threshold requirements are met, and (c) a memorandum dated September 20, 2011 and published by the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, in which the Department concludes, among other things, that the Federal Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”) does not apply to interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a sporting event or contest. To date, states such as Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina and North Dakota have some form of internet or online gaming or lottery activities.
     However, the legislative and regulatory environment surrounding online, wager-based games in the United States remains uncertain and complex, and it is unclear how the legislative and regulatory framework governing these activities will evolve in the future. Many states have yet to introduce or finalize regulations regarding the licensing and operational requirements regarding online, wager-based activity, including the licensing and technological requirements relating to the funding and processing of payments relating to online, wager-based casino and lottery games. In addition, the funding of online casino gaming activity is subject to the requirement of the UIGEA, which may prohibit or significantly impede the funding of online, wager-based gaming activity. There is also a possibility that the Wire Act may be amended in the future to prevent or prohibit the use of Internet or mobile-based platforms regardless of the involvement of a sporting event or contest. 
     Financial Services Regulation
     Our Payments business is also subject to a number of financial services regulations:
     Durbin Amendment. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees, among other things, which took effect on October 1, 2011. This rule, Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing) was promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) as modified by the Durbin Amendment (the “Durbin Amendment”), and establishes, among other things, standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by certain debit card issuers are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions. Debit card interchange fees are established by payment card networks and ultimately paid by merchants to debit card issuers for each debit transaction. 
     Anti-Money Laundering. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and its implementing federal regulations require us to establish and maintain an anti-money laundering program. Our anti-money laundering program includes: internal policies, procedures and controls designed to identify and report money laundering, a designated compliance officer, an ongoing employee training program, and an independent audit function to test the program. In addition, the cash access services that we provide are subject to record keeping and reporting obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Our gaming establishment customers are required to file a SAR with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to report any suspicious transactions relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation. We are also required to 

 
  16

 
file a SAR where we provide our cash access services directly to patrons through financial services centers that we staff and operate. To be reportable, such a transaction must meet criteria that are designed to identify the hiding or disguising of funds derived from illegal activities. Our gaming establishment customers, in situations where our cash access services are provided through gaming establishment cashier personnel, and we, in situations where we provide our cash access services through a financial services center, are required to file a CTRC of each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency or other payment or transfer by, through or to us which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000 in a single day. Our CashClub® product can assist in identifying transactions that give rise to reporting obligations. When we issue or sell drafts for currency in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000, we maintain a record of information about the purchaser, such as the purchaser’s address and date of birth.
     Fund Transfers. Our POS debit card cash access transactions, credit card cash access transactions and ATM services are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which provides cardholders with rights with respect to electronic fund transfers, including the right to dispute unauthorized charges, charges that list the wrong date or amount, charges for goods and services that are not accepted or delivered as agreed, math errors and charges for which a cardholder asks for an explanation or written proof of transaction along with a claimed error or request for clarification. We believe the necessary policies and procedures have been implemented throughout our organization in order to comply with the regulatory requirements for fund transfers.
     State Money Transmission Laws. Many states where we complete credit card cash access and POS debit card cash access transactions or offer our online payment processing solution require us to have a money transmitter license.
     Credit Reporting. Our Central Credit gaming patron credit bureau services and check verification and warranty services are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 and their implementing rules, which require consumer credit bureaus, such as Central Credit, to provide credit report information to businesses only for certain purposes and to otherwise safeguard credit report information, to disclose to consumers their credit report on request, and to permit consumers to dispute and correct inaccurate or incomplete information in their credit report. These laws and rules also govern the information that may be contained in a consumer credit report. We continue to implement policies and procedures as well as adapt our business practices in order to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition to federal regulations, our Central Credit gaming patron credit bureau services are subject to the state credit reporting regulations that impose similar requirements to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003.
     Debt Collection. We currently outsource most of our debt collection efforts to third parties. However, we do engage in debt collection to collect on chargebacks on our cash access products and unpaid balances for services performed for our check services, Central Credit services, compliance services, receivables relating to the sale and service of our fully integrated kiosks and other integrated kiosk solutions, and other amounts owing to us in connection with performing various services for our customers. All such collection practices may be subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive debt collection practices, as well as consumer-debt-collection laws and regulations adopted by the various states.
     Privacy Regulations. Our collection of information from patrons who use our financial products and services, such as our cash access services, are subject to the financial information privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing federal regulations. We gather, as permitted by law, non-public, personally-identifiable financial information from patrons who use our cash access services, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, bank and credit card account numbers and transaction information. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires us to safeguard and protect the privacy of such non-public personal information and also requires us to make disclosures to patrons regarding our privacy and information sharing policies and give patrons the opportunity to direct us not to disclose information about them to unaffiliated third parties in certain situations. We are also subject to state privacy regulations which, in some cases, may be even stricter than federal law. We continue to implement policies and programs as well as adapt our business practices in order to comply with federal and state privacy laws and regulations.
     ATM Operations. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act requires us to disclose certain notices regarding the fees that we charge for performing an ATM transaction as well as to incorporate such notices on the ATM screens to notify patrons of such fees prior to completing an ATM transaction. Our ATM services are also subject to applicable state banking 

 
  17

 
regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate ATMs which require, among other things, that we register with the state banking regulators as an operator of ATMs, that we provide gaming patrons with notices of the transaction fees assessed upon use of our ATMs, that our transaction fees do not exceed designated maximums, that we offer gaming patrons a means of resolving disputes with us, and that we comply with prescribed safety and security requirements. In addition, the ATMs that we operate are subject to requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which in general require that ATMs be accessible to individuals with disabilities, such as visually-impaired persons.
     Check Cashing. In jurisdictions in which we serve as a check casher, we are required to be licensed by the applicable state banking regulator to operate as a check casher. Some states also impose restrictions on this activity, such as limits on the amounts of service fees that may be imposed on the cashing of certain types of checks, requirements as to records that must be kept with respect to dishonored checks and requirements as to the contents of receipts that must be delivered to gaming patrons at the time a check is cashed.
     Network and Card Association Regulations. In addition to the governmental regulation described above, some of our services are also subject to rules promulgated by various payment networks, EFT networks and card associations. For example, we must comply with the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standard. We have been designated as a compliant service provider under the PCI Data Security Standard. We must be certified to maintain our status as a compliant service provider on an annual basis.
     Europay, MasterCard and Visa jointly developed new card security features (“EMV”), designed to deter fraudulent card transactions related to identity theft, counterfeit cards and the misuse of lost or stolen cards via enhanced card authentication, transaction authorization and cardholder verification using chip-based smart-cards. EMV has been adopted in many regions of the world as the global standard for fraud deterrence in chip-based smart-card payments. In October 2015, the network and card associations began shifting liability for fraudulent POS and ATM transactions generated through EMV-capable cards onto merchants whose devices are not capable of processing chip-based smart-card EMV transactions. This shifts the responsibility for chargebacks due to fraudulent transactions on such cards from the card issuer onto the merchant. 
     As a merchant of cash access transactions processed through MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express, all who have adopted the EMV standard, and as an operator of ATMs, our POS, fully integrated kiosk and ATM devices are subject to the EMV standard. This requires us to maintain our fleet of U.S.-based POS, fully integrated kiosk and ATM devices to support the EMV standard.
     International Regulation
     We are also subject to a variety of gaming and financial services regulations and other laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in the international markets in which we operate. We expect to become subject to additional gaming and financial services regulations and other laws in the jurisdictions into which we expand our operations. Our expansion into new markets is dependent upon our ability to comply with the regulatory regimes adopted by such jurisdictions. Difficulties in obtaining approvals, licenses or waivers from the gaming and monetary authorities, in addition to other potential regulatory and quasi-regulatory issues that we have not yet ascertained, may arise in other international jurisdictions into which we wish to enter.
