Competition
We face strong competition in attracting and retaining deposits, originating loans, and providing title services. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions located in our market areas, including many large financial institutions that have greater financial and marketing resources available to them. In addition, during times of high interest rates, we have faced significant competition for investors’ funds from short-term money market securities, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. Our ability to attract and retain customer deposits depends on our ability to generally provide a mix of return on deposited funds, liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities.
We experience strong competition for loan originations principally from other commercial banks, savings institutions, and mortgage banking companies. We compete for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees we charge, the efficiency and quality of services we provide borrowers, and the convenient locations of our branch office network and access to services such as mobile banking.
Employees
We had 3,373 full-time associates and 65 part-time associates as of December 31, 2019. None of these associates are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we enjoy an excellent relationship with our associates. 
Merger Agreement with First Horizon
On November 4, 2019, the Company and First Horizon entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "merger agreement"), pursuant to which First Horizon and the Company have agreed to combine their respective businesses in a merger of equals. Under the merger agreement, the Company will merge with and into First Horizon (the “merger”), with First Horizon as the surviving entity (the “combined company”). Following the completion of the merger, IBERIABANK will merge with and into First Horizon Bank, a subsidiary of First Horizon, with First Horizon Bank as the surviving bank. The merger agreement was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company and First Horizon.
For additional information regarding the merger and the merger agreement, refer to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 3, 2019, filed on November 4, 2019, and the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 3, 2019, filed on November 7, 2019, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Supervision and Regulation
The banking industry is extensively regulated under both federal and applicable state laws. The following discussion summarizes certain statutes and regulations applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides specific information relevant to us. Regulation of financial institutions is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, deposit insurance funds and the banking system, and generally is not intended for the protection of shareholders. Proposals are frequently introduced to change federal and state laws and regulations applicable to us, and new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations (including changes in interpretations or enforcement) could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations or prospects. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes might have on us are impossible to determine with any certainty. Descriptions of applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations.
General
We are a bank holding company and have elected to be a financial holding company under the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”). We are subject to examination and supervision by the FRB pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and are required to file reports and other information with the FRB regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries.
Generally, the BHCA provides for “umbrella” regulation of bank holding companies by the FRB and functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies. The BHCA, however, requires the FRB to examine any bank holding company subsidiary, other than a depository institution, engaged in activities permissible for a depository institution. The FRB is also granted the authority, in certain circumstances, to require reports of, and to examine and adopt rules applicable to, any bank holding company subsidiary.
In general, the BHCA and the FRB’s regulations limit the nonbanking activities permissible for bank holding companies to those activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company, such as the Company, may engage in, or acquire and retain shares of companies engaged in, a broader range of activities that are considered (i) “financial in nature” (as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and FRB regulations) or incidental to such financial activities (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury), or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. These activities include, among other things, securities underwriting, dealing and market-making, sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency activities, and merchant banking. Refer to “Holding Company Regulation - Financial Holding Company Status” below.
Because we are a public company, we are also subject to regulation by the SEC. The SEC has established three categories of registrants for the purpose of filing periodic and annual reports. Under these regulations, we are considered to be a “large accelerated filer” and, as such, must comply with SEC large accelerated reporting requirements.
As a Louisiana-chartered commercial bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, IBERIABANK is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of Financial Institutions of the State of Louisiana (the “OFI”), IBERIABANK’s chartering authority, and the FRB, IBERIABANK’s primary federal regulator. IBERIABANK is also subject to regulation and supervision in certain respects by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) as well as to regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), which insures the deposits of IBERIABANK to the maximum extent permitted by law.
State and federal laws govern the activities in which IBERIABANK may engage, the investments it may make and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also apply to IBERIABANK’s operations.
The banking industry is affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the national supply of bank credit to moderate recessions and curb inflation. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the FRB to implement its objectives are: open-market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate and the federal funds rate (which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight borrowings) and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits.
In addition to federal and state banking laws and regulations, the Company, IBERIABANK, and certain of their subsidiaries and affiliates, including those that engage in securities brokerage and insurance activities, are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, and supervision and examination by other state and federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the SEC, and various state insurance and securities regulators.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
Bank holding companies and federally insured banks are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital in accordance with standards established by the federal banking authorities. The current capital regulations were effective January 1, 2015 and represented increased standards over the previous requirements for bank holding companies and banks. These capital rules (commonly referred to as “Basel III”) reflect the recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, as well as implementing certain requirements of federal statute.
The Basel III capital rules require the maintenance of the following minimum capital ratios: 4.5% common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; 8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the “leverage ratio”) as reported on the consolidated financial statements.
Common equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1”) is defined as common stock instruments, retained earnings, qualifying minority interest and accumulated other comprehensive income, net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. Tier 1 capital is defined as CET1 capital plus certain qualifying subordinated interests and grandfathered capital instruments. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying subordinated instruments and certain grandfathered capital instruments. 
In addition to establishing minimum regulatory capital requirements, the Basel III capital rules limit dividend payments, stock repurchases and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if a banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. Accordingly, the Company and IBERIABANK are required to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (Tier 1 capital plus supplementary capital ) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%, and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, an institution’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the capital regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on non-accrual status, and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
Failure to meet applicable capital standards could subject the Company or IBERIABANK to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authorities of a capital directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. In addition, a financial institution that fails to meet its capital requirements could be subject to the measures described below under “Federal Banking Regulation - Prompt Corrective Action” as applicable to “under-capitalized” institutions.
The FRB’s capital standards specify that evaluations by the FRB of a bank’s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of the bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates. A joint policy statement of the federal banking agencies highlights key elements of prudent interest rate risk management that rely principally on internal measures of risk exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management.
Additional information, including our compliance with applicable capital requirements at December 31, 2019, is provided in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Capital Resources section of MD&A in this Form 10-K.
Payment of Dividends
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. The majority of our revenue is from dividends paid to us by IBERIABANK. IBERIABANK is subject to federal and state laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, we and IBERIABANK are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including the requirement to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums plus the capital conservation buffer. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for a bank holding company to pay dividends unless the bank holding company’s net income over the preceding four quarters is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
In addition to the limitations placed on the payment of dividends at the holding company level, there are various legal and regulatory limits on the extent to which IBERIABANK may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to us. IBERIABANK is subject to laws and regulations of Louisiana, which place certain restrictions on the payment of dividends. Additionally, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, IBERIABANK is subject to FRB dividend regulations, which provide that a state member bank must receive prior FRB approval for a dividend if the total capital distributions of a state member bank, plus the proposed dividend, exceed the sum of the bank’s net income during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years. IBERIABANK would also be subject under the prompt corrective action regulations to restrictions on the payment of dividends if it did not remain “well-capitalized.” See “Federal Banking Regulation - Prompt Corrective Action.”
We do not expect that these laws, regulations or policies will materially affect our ability to pay dividends. Additional information is provided in Note 13 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Federal Banking Regulation
FDIC Insurance. The FDIC, through the Deposit Insurance Fund, insures deposit accounts in IBERIABANK up to $250,000 per separately insured deposit ownership right or category. 
IBERIABANK pays deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC based on assessment rates established by the FDIC. The FDIC’s deposit insurance assessment structure is based on the perceived risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund of the institution, with institutions deemed riskier paying higher assessments. The FDIC’s assessment schedule currently ranges from 1.5 basis points to 40 basis points of average total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the range of assessments uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base assessment rate without notice and comment rulemaking.
In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) to impose assessments on applicable deposits in order to service the interest on FICO’s bond obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments. The FICO assessment rates averaged approximately 0.0013% of insured deposits on an annualized basis for the first two calendar quarters of 2019. With the maturing of the final FICO bonds, the FICO assessments were terminated after the second quarter of 2019.
Prompt Corrective Action. The federal banking regulatory authorities are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The prompt corrective action rules, which apply to IBERIABANK but not the Company, provide for five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The requirements for IBERIABANK to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action rules are a 5.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 6.5% CET1 risk-based ratio, an 8.0% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 10.0% total risk-based capital ratio. To be adequately capitalized, the required ratios are 4.0%, 4.5%. 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. An FDIC-insured depository institution that is neither well-capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized under the rules. 
An institution that is not well-capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its markets. An institution is generally is prohibited from paying any dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution is, or would thereafter be, undercapitalized. An undercapitalized institution is subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System, growth limitations, and a requirement to submit a capital restoration plan. Undercapitalized depository institutions are also subject under federal statute and the prompt corrective regulations to specified supervisory actions by the federal banking regulators, the severity of which depends on the degree of undercapitalization. 
The FRB is authorized to reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category.
Throughout 2019 and as of December 31, 2019, IBERIABANK’s regulatory capital ratios were in excess of the levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions.
Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act’s Volcker Rule, as implemented by interagency regulations adopted in 2013, generally prohibits IBERIABANK and its affiliates from (i) engaging in proprietary trading for their own account or (ii) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund, all subject to certain exceptions. These prohibitions affect the ability of U.S. banking entities to provide investment management products and services that are competitive with nonbanking firms generally and with non-U.S. banking organizations in overseas markets. The rule also effectively prohibits short-term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading.
The Volcker Rule regulation provides certain exemptions allowing banking entities to continue underwriting, market-making and hedging activities and trading certain government obligations, as well as various exemptions and exclusions from the definition of “covered funds.” The rule imposes certain reporting and compliance requirements on banking entities that engage in exempted trading activities. The level of required compliance depends on the size of the banking entity and the extent of its trading, with most requirements applicable only to banking entities with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, or those with $50 billion or more in worldwide trading assets and liabilities. As a banking entity with more than $10 billion in total assets but less than $10 billion in total consolidated trading assets and liabilities, we were required by the Volcker Rule to implement a compliance program appropriate for the types, size, scope, and complexity of our permitted trading activities. On August 20, 2019, the federal banking regulators issued a final regulation amending the Volcker Rule that simplifies and reduces the Volcker Rule’s compliance burdens. Under the final regulation, given our limited trading assets and liabilities, we are presumed to be in compliance with the Volcker Rule and are no longer required to maintain a separate compliance program.
Federal Reserve Bank Membership. IBERIABANK is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is required to buy stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in an amount equal to 6% of IBERIABANK’s paid-in capital and surplus. IBERIABANK receives statutory dividends on the stock it holds in the Federal Reserve Bank in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the high yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note at the last auction prior to the dividend payment or (ii) 6%.
Transactions with Related Parties. IBERIABANK is subject to the FRB’s Regulation W, which comprehensively implements statutory restrictions on transactions between a bank and its affiliates and incorporates the FRB’s interpretations and exemptions relating to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.
Section 23A and Regulation W generally place limits on the amount of a bank’s loans or extensions of credit to, investments in, or certain other transactions with affiliates, and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates. In general, IBERIABANK’s “affiliates” are IBERIABANK Corporation and our non-bank subsidiaries.
Section 23B and Regulation W generally require a bank’s transactions with its affiliates to be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies.
IBERIABANK is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders and their related interests. Such extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and its related regulations, requires insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The statute and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory enforcement action, may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements.
Consumer Protection Laws. In connection with our deposit-taking, lending and other activities, IBERIABANK is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending and other financial services to various sectors of the economy and population. The CFPB issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws, which include, among others, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Truth in Savings Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. IBERIABANK’S consumer financial products and services are subject to the regulations of the CFPB and, as an institution with assets of more than $10 billion, IBERIABANK is examined by the CFPB for compliance with these rules.
In addition, customer privacy statutes and regulations limit the ability of the Bank to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. These laws require us to provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices and to give our customers an option to prevent their non-public personal information from being shared with non-affiliated third parties or with our affiliates.
Community Reinvestment Act. All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”) and related federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank like IBERIABANK, the FRB is required to assess our record of compliance with the CRA. Such assessment is reviewed by the FRB when the Company or IBERIABANK makes application for approval of an expansionary proposal, such as a merger or other acquisition of another bank or the opening of a new branch office. In addition, in order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHCA or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the CRA. IBERIABANK received a “satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent assessment by the FRB.
Incentive Compensation. Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance on incentive compensation policies (the “Incentive Compensation Guidance”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The Incentive Compensation Guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In 2016, the federal banking agencies and the SEC issued for comment a proposed interagency rule that would require the reporting of incentive-based compensation arrangements at a covered financial institution when such compensation is excessive, could expose the institution to inappropriate risks, or could potentially lead to material financial loss. The proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would impose no material requirements on institutions with total assets of less than $50 billion, like the Company and IBERIABANK, other than those already applied to such institutions by the Incentive Compensation Guidance. The rule has not been finalized, nor has it been withdrawn. We cannot predict whether the proposed rule will be issued in final form or whether the agencies will issue a substantially revised proposed rule.
Holding Company Regulation
General. As a bank holding company, we are subject to FRB examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the BHCA. The FRB has broad enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries. The FRB has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule, regulation, administrative order or written agreement with a federal regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil money penalties or other formal or informal actions.
Source of Strength. As a statutory requirement, a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. Under this source of strength doctrine, the FRB may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. The FRB may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the FRB believes might jeopardize its ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company does not have the resources to provide it.
In addition, any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations.
Louisiana law permits the Commissioner of the OFI to require a special assessment of shareholders of a Louisiana-chartered bank whose capital has become impaired to remedy an impairment in such bank’s capital stock. This statute also provides that the Commissioner may suspend a bank’s certificate of authority until the capital is restored. As the sole shareholder of IBERIABANK, we are subject to such statute.
Acquisitions. We comply with numerous laws relating to our acquisition activity. Under the BHCA, we are required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank holding company or bank or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. Federal law authorizes bank holding companies to make interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation. Furthermore, a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state, subject to any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years; and subject to certain deposit market-share limitations. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provided authority for any bank to open de novo branches in any other state as if it were chartered in that state.
Financial Holding Company Status. A bank holding company meeting certain requirements may qualify and elect to become a financial holding company, permitting the bank holding company to engage in additional activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activity. A bank holding company that elects to be treated as a financial holding company is authorized by the BHCA to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including equity securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities through securities or insurance affiliates; and insurance company portfolio investments. The BHCA also permits the FRB to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies if they are “financial in nature” or “incidental” to financial activities. The Company has elected financial holding company status.
For a bank holding company to be eligible for financial holding company status, the holding company must be both “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” under applicable regulatory standards, and all of its subsidiary banks also must be “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” and must have received at least a satisfactory rating on such institution’s most recent examination under the CRA. A financial holding company that continues to meet all of such requirements may engage directly or indirectly in activities considered financial in nature (discussed above), either de novo or by acquisition, as long as it gives the FRB after-the-fact notice of the new activities.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the SOX Act, implemented a broad range of corporate governance, accounting and disclosure requirements for public companies, and also for their directors and officers. SEC rules adopted to implement the SOX Act requirements require our chief executive and chief financial officer to certify certain financial and other information included in our quarterly and annual reports. The rules also require these officers to certify that they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; that they have made certain disclosures to the auditors and to the Audit Committee of the board of directors about our controls and procedures; and that they have included information in their quarterly and annual filings about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes to the controls and procedures or other factors which would significantly impact these controls subsequent to their evaluation. Section 404 of the SOX Act requires management to undertake an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and requires our auditors to attest to and report on the effectiveness of these controls. See Item 9A. - “Controls and Procedures” for our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the SOX Act also accompany this Report on Form 10-K.
