Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
MoneyGram International, Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, "MoneyGram," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our") is a global leader in cross-border P2P payments and money transfers. Our consumer-centric capabilities enable family and friends to quickly and affordably send money in more than 200 countries and territories with over 100 countries digitally-enabled as of December 31, 2021. The innovative MoneyGram platform leverages its leading distribution network, global financial settlement engine, cloud-based infrastructure with integrated APIs and its unparalleled compliance program to enable seamless and secure transfers around the world. Whether through our mobile application, moneygram.com, integration with account deposit and mobile wallets, kiosks, or any one of the more than 430,000 agent locations around the globe, we connect consumers, primarily those who may not be fully served by other financial institutions, in any way that is convenient for them. As an alternative financial services company, we provide individuals with essential services to help them meet the financial demands of their daily lives. Our growing direct-to-consumer digital business, our Retail Channel centered around our global distribution network, our emerging embedded finance business for enterprise customers and MoneyGram-as-a-Service, enable the Company to serve the entire remittance market. Given strong mobile P2P market growth rates, our direct-to-consumer digital business is a growth engine for the Company as our digital capabilities enable us to serve new customer segments who utilize our platform to transfer money around the world.
Our money transfer services are our primary revenue driver, but MoneyGram has additional offerings which include bill payment services, money order services and official check processing. We have one primary customer care center in Warsaw, Poland, with regional support centers providing ancillary services and additional call center services in various countries. MoneyGram provides call center services 24 hours per day, 365 days per year and provides customer service in dozens of languages.
The MoneyGram® brand has name recognition throughout the world. We use various trademarks and service marks in our business, including, but not limited, to MoneyGram, the red Globe design logo, MoneyGram FastSend, ExpressPayment and AgentWorks, some of which are registered in the U.S. and other countries. This document also contains trademarks and service marks of other businesses that are the property of their respective holders and are used herein solely for identification purposes. We have omitted the ® and TM designations, as applicable, for the trademarks we reference in this 2021 Form 10-K.
We conduct our business primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, MoneyGram Payment Systems, Inc. ("MPSI"), under the MoneyGram brand. The Company was incorporated in Delaware on December 18, 2003. Through the Company's predecessors, we have been in operation since 1940.
Recent Developments
On February 14, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") by and among the Company, Mobius Parent Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Parent") and an affiliate of Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC ("Madison Dearborn"), and Mobius Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub").
The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"). Following the Merger the Company will become a subsidiary of Parent. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $11.00 in cash. Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or, if permitted by law, waiver by Parent, the Company or both of a number of conditions, including, among other things, (a) approval of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, (b) expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (c) the receipt of required approvals with respect to money transmitter licenses and applicable foreign investment and competition laws, (d) the absence of any material adverse effect on the Company's business and (e) other customary closing conditions. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for the parties, including the right of the parties, subject to specified limitations, to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by February 13, 2023 (the "End Date"), although the End Date may be extended to May 14, 2023 in certain circumstances to obtain required money transfer approvals. The terms of the Merger Agreement did not impact the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our Segments
We manage our business primarily through two reporting segments: Global Funds Transfer ("GFT") and Financial Paper Products ("FPP"). The following table presents the components of our consolidated revenue associated with our reporting segments for the years ended December 31:

 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
GFT | | | | | 
Money transfer | 93 | % | | 91 | % | 87 | %
Bill payment | 3 | % | | 4 | % | 5 | %
FPP | | | | | 
Money order | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 4 | %
Official check | 1 | % | | 2 | % | 4 | %
Total revenue | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 17 — Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional financial information about our segments and geographic areas.
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, our 10 largest agents accounted for 26%, 30% and 32%, respectively, of total revenue and 26%, 31% and 34%, respectively, of GFT segment revenue. Walmart Inc. ("Walmart") is our only agent that accounts for more than 10% of our total revenue. In 2021, 2020 and 2019 Walmart accounted for 11%, 13% and 16% of total revenue, respectively. In 2021, 2020 and 2019 Walmart accounted for 10%, 13% and 16% of GFT segment revenue, respectively.
GFT Segment
The GFT segment is our primary revenue driver, providing global money transfer services and bill payment services principally as an alternative to banking services in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. We primarily offer services through third-party agents, including retail chains, independent retailers, post offices, banks and other financial institutions. We also offer digital solutions such as moneygram.com, mobile app solutions, account deposit and kiosk-based services. Additionally, we have limited Company-operated retail locations.
In October 2021, we entered into a partnership with The Stellar Development Foundation ("SDF"), a non-profit organization that supports the development and growth of Stellar, an open-source public blockchain that allows money to be tokenized and transferred anywhere in the world. MoneyGram's network, integrated with the Stellar blockchain and facilitated through Circle's USD Coin (USDC), enable cash funding and payout in local currency for consumers using USDC.
We continue to focus on the growth of our GFT segment for outbound transactions originating in the U.S. and those originating outside of the U.S. Sends originated outside of the U.S. generated 58% in 2021, 55% in 2020 and 52% in 2019 of our total revenue and 60% in 2021, 59% in 2020 and 57% in 2019 of our total GFT segment revenue. In 2021, our GFT segment had total revenue of $1.2 billion.
Money Transfer — We earn our money transfer revenues primarily from consumer transaction fees and the management of currency exchange spreads on money transfer transactions involving different "send" and "receive" currencies. We have Corridor pricing capabilities that provide us flexibility when establishing consumer fees and non-U.S. dollar exchange rates for our money transfer services, which allow us to remain competitive in all locations. In a cash-to-cash money transfer transaction, both the agent initiating and receiving the transaction earn a commission that is generally based on a percentage of the fee charged to the consumer, or in certain cases a fixed commission. When a money transfer transaction is initiated at a MoneyGram-owned store or via our online platform, typically only the agent receiving the transaction earns a commission.
In certain countries, we have multi-currency technology that allows consumers to choose a currency when initiating or receiving a money transfer. The currency choice typically consists of local currency, U.S. dollars and/or euros. These capabilities allow consumers to know the amount that will be received in the selected currency.
Retail Channel
As of December 31, 2021, our money transfer agent network had more than 430,000 locations. Our network includes agents such as international post offices, banks and broader financial services, as well as large and small retailers. Additionally, we have a limited number of Company-owned and operated retail locations in Western Europe. Some of our agents outside the U.S. manage sub-agents that offer MoneyGram branded services. We refer to these agents as super-agents. Although the sub-agents are under contract with these super-agents, the sub-agent locations typically have access to similar technology and services as our other agent locations. Many of our agents have multiple locations, a large number of which operate in locations that are open outside of traditional banking hours, including nights and weekends. Our agents know the markets they serve, and 
they work with our sales and marketing teams to develop business plans for their markets. This may include contributing financial resources to, or otherwise supporting, our efforts to market MoneyGram's services.
Typically, retail send transactions are funded in cash. In retail receive transactions, the funds are available for the designated recipient to collect usually within 10 minutes at any MoneyGram agent location.
As of December 31, 2021, in over 90 countries, the designated recipient may also receive the transferred funds via a deposit to the recipient's bank account or mobile wallet account.
Digital Channel
We offer money transfer services through our Digital Channel which includes MGO (our direct-to-consumer business), digital partners, direct transfers to bank accounts, mobile wallets and debit card solutions such as Visa Direct. MGO is available in 37 countries and territories as of December 31, 2021. Through our Digital Channel, consumers can send money from the convenience of their own homes to any of our agent locations worldwide, a recipient's bank account or a recipient's mobile wallet. MGO consumers can fund their transactions from their bank accounts, debit cards, or credit cards. MGO, the Company’s single largest generator of money transfer transactions, maintains three of its individual country sites on the Company’s top 10 list of money transfer generating sources. In 2021, MGO’s U.S. site became the Company's largest source of money transfer revenue in the world, surpassing Walmart. Cross-border money transfer transactions through MGO grew 57% in 2021 compared to the prior year.
We also offer money transfer services via digital partners, which enable our partners’ customers to send international money transfers online or through a mobile device to any MoneyGram pay-out location or directly to a recipient’s bank account or mobile wallet through the MoneyGram platform.
Transfers directly to bank accounts and mobile wallets are the third main component of our Digital Channel. Through the MoneyGram platform, customers had direct access to over 4.0 billion accounts in over 90 countries as of December 31, 2021. Total digital transactions represented 34% of money transfer transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Bill Payment Services — Bill payment revenues are generated primarily from fees charged to consumers for each transaction completed. Our primary bill payment service offering is our ExpressPayment service, which we offer at substantially all of our money transfer agent locations in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, at certain agent locations in select Caribbean and European countries and through our digital solutions.
Through our bill payment services, consumers can complete urgent bill payments, pay routine bills, or load and reload prepaid debit cards with cash at an agent location or through moneygram.com. We offer consumers same-day and two- or three-day payment service options; the service option is dependent upon our agreement with the biller. We offer payment options to over 12,000 billers in key industries, including the ability to allow the consumer to load or reload funds to over 500 prepaid debit card programs. These industries include the credit card, mortgage, auto finance, telecommunications, corrections, health care, utilities, property management, prepaid card and collections industries.
Marketing — The global marketing organization employs an omnichannel approach that tailors our brand message to each specific market, culture and consumer preferences. The organization is increasingly focusing on search related digital marketing tactics to reach consumers on their computers and mobile devices. Our marketing strategy also includes our MoneyGram Plus Rewards loyalty program that gives consumers the benefit of earning discounts on future transactions and special promotions available only to loyalty members.
Sales — Our sales teams are organized by geographic area, product and delivery channel. We have dedicated teams focused on developing our agent and biller networks to enhance the reach of our money transfer and bill payment products. Our agent requirements vary depending upon the type of outlet, location and compliance and regulatory requirements. Our sales teams and strategic partnership teams continue to improve our agent relationships and overall network strength with a goal of providing the optimal agent and consumer experience.
Competition — The market for money transfer and bill payment services is very competitive on a regional and global basis. We generally compete on customer experience, price, the ability to conduct both digital and cash transactions, the convenience of multiple payout options across a broad global network in over 200 countries & territories, commission payments, customer loyalty program initiatives and marketing efforts. 
Our competitors include a small number of large money transfer and bill payment providers, financial institutions, banks and a large number of small niche money transfer service providers that serve select regions. Our largest competitor in the cross-border money transfer industry is The Western Union Company ("Western Union"), which also competes with our bill payment services and money order businesses. Additionally, Walmart has a white-label money transfer service, operated by a competitor of MoneyGram, that allows consumers to transfer money between Walmart U.S. store locations. In 2018, Walmart launched Walmart2World, Powered by MoneyGram, a new white-label money transfer service that allows customers to send money from Walmart in the U.S. to any MoneyGram location in the world. On November 4, 2019, Walmart announced that the white-label 
money transfer service would now be joined by other brands in becoming part of a marketplace of money transfer services at Walmart stores across the U.S. On January 19, 2021, Walmart informed us that they had entered into a new agreement that would enable Western Union money transfer, bill payment and money order services at U.S. Walmart locations.
We expect to encounter increasing competition as digitally-focused new entrants seek to grow revenue through customer acquisition initiatives focused on specific Corridors, but we believe we will continue to differentiate against the competition by competing on a global scale, addressing the entire remittance market by offering digital and cash capabilities and delivering a superior customer experience in addition to continuing to be a fintech innovator and a leader in protecting consumers through our unparalleled compliance engine and variety of product offerings.
Seasonality — A larger share of our annual money transfer revenues traditionally occurs in the second and fourth quarters as a result of major global holidays falling during these periods, in addition to seasonal travel patterns throughout the world.
FPP Segment
Our FPP segment provides money orders to consumers through our agents and financial institutions located throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico and provides official check outsourcing services for banks and credit unions across the U.S.
In 2021, our FPP segment generated revenues of $54.8 million from fee and other revenue and investment revenue. We earn revenue from the investment of funds underlying outstanding official checks and money orders. We refer to our cash and cash equivalents, settlement cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing investments and available-for-sale investments collectively as our "investment portfolio." Our investment portfolio consists of low risk, highly liquid bank deposits that earn a market rate of return for similar investments.
Money Orders — Consumers use our money orders to make payments in lieu of cash or personal checks. We generate revenue from money orders by charging per item and other fees, as well as from the investment of funds underlying outstanding money orders, which generally remain outstanding for approximately eight days. We sell money orders under the MoneyGram brand and on a private label or co-branded basis with certain agents and financial institutions in the U.S. As of December 31, 2021, we issued money orders through our network of over 9,800 agents and financial institutions located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.
Official Check Outsourcing Services — Official checks are used by consumers where a payee requires a check drawn on a bank. Financial institutions also use official checks to pay their own obligations. Similar to money orders, we generate revenue from our official check outsourcing services through U.S. banks and credit unions by charging per item and other fees, as well as from the investment of funds underlying outstanding official checks, which generally remain outstanding for approximately four days. As of December 31, 2021, we provided official check outsourcing services through 630 financial institutions at over 6,400 branch bank locations.
Marketing — We employ a wide range of marketing methods. We use a marketing mix to support our brand, which includes traditional, digital and social media, point of sale materials, signage at our agent locations and targeted marketing campaigns. Official checks are financial institution branded, and therefore, all marketing to this segment is business to business.
Sales — Our sales teams are organized by product and delivery channel. We have dedicated teams that focus on developing our agent and financial institution networks to enhance the reach of our official check and money order products. Our agent and financial institution requirements vary depending upon the type of outlet or location, and our sales teams continue to improve and strengthen these relationships with a goal of providing the optimal consumer experience with our agents and financial institutions.
Competition — Our money order competitors include a small number of large money order providers and a large number of small regional and niche money order providers. Our largest competitors in the money order industry are Western Union and the U.S. Postal Service. We generally compete for money order agents on the basis of value, service, quality, technical and operational differences, price, commission and marketing efforts. We compete for money order consumers on the basis of trust, convenience, availability of outlets, price, technology and brand recognition.
Official check competitors include financial institution solution providers, such as core data processors and corporate credit unions. We generally compete against a financial institution's desire to perform these processes in-house with support from these types of organizations. We compete for official check customers on the basis of value, service, quality, technical and operational differences, price and commission.
Regulation
Compliance with laws and regulations is a highly complex and integral part of our day-to-day operations. Our operations are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries, including anti-money laundering laws and regulations; financial services regulations; currency control regulations; anti-bribery laws; sanctions laws and regulations; money transfer and payment instrument licensing laws; escheatment laws; privacy, data protection and information security laws; and consumer disclosure and consumer protection laws. Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened supervision of money transfer providers and requiring increased efforts to ensure compliance. Failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services, as well as the potential imposition of civil fines and possibly criminal penalties. See the Risk Factors section in Item 1A for additional discussion regarding potential impacts of failure to comply. We continually monitor and enhance our global compliance programs in light of the most recent legal and regulatory changes.
Anti-Money Laundering Compliance
Our services are subject to U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as well as state laws and regulations and the anti-money laundering laws and regulations of many of the countries in which we operate, particularly in the European Union. Countries in which we operate may require one or more of the following:
•reporting of large cash transactions and suspicious activity;
•limitations on amounts that may be transferred by a consumer or from a jurisdiction at any one time or over specified periods of time, which require aggregation over multiple transactions;
•consumer information gathering and reporting requirements;
•consumer disclosure requirements, including language requirements and non-U.S. dollar restrictions;
•notification requirements as to the identity of contracting agents, governmental approval of contracting agents or requirements and limitations on contract terms with our agents;
•registration or licensing of the Company or our agents with a state or federal agency in the U.S. or with the central bank or other proper authority in a foreign country; and
•minimum capital or capital adequacy requirements.
Anti-money laundering regulations are constantly evolving and vary from country to country. We continuously monitor our compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and implement policies and procedures in light of the most current legal requirements.
We offer our money transfer services primarily through third-party agents with whom we contract and do not directly control. As a money services business, we and our agents are required to establish anti-money laundering compliance programs that include: (i) internal policies and controls; (ii) designation of a compliance officer; (iii) ongoing employee training and (iv) an independent review function. We have developed an anti-money laundering training manual available in multiple languages and a program to assist with the education of our agents on the various rules and regulations. We also offer in-person and online training as part of our agent compliance training program and engage in various agent oversight activities. We have also adopted a global compliance policy that outlines key principles of our compliance program to our agents. 
In connection with regulatory requirements to assist in the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activities and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, the Company makes information available to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as certain foreign, government agencies when required by law. In recent years, the Company has experienced an increase in data sharing requests by these agencies, particularly in connection with efforts to prevent money laundering or terrorist financing or reduce the risk of consumer fraud. In certain cases, the Company is also required by government agencies to deny transactions that may be related to persons suspected of money laundering, terrorist financing or other illegal activities, and as a result the Company may inadvertently deny transactions from customers who are making legal money transfers, which could lead to liability or reputational damage. Responding to these agency requests may result in increased operational costs.
Sanctions Compliance
In addition to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, our services are subject to sanctions laws and regulations promulgated by OFAC and other jurisdictions in which our services are offered. These sanctions laws and regulations require screening of transactions against government watch-lists, including but not limited to, the watch-lists maintained by OFAC and prohibit transactions in, to or from certain countries, governments, individuals and entities. Sanctions regimes may also impose limitations on amounts that may be transferred by a consumer to or from a jurisdiction at any one time or over specified periods of time, requiring aggregation over multiple transactions, as well as transactional and other reporting to a government agency.
Money Transfer and Payment Instrument Licensing
In most countries, either we or our agents are required to obtain licenses or to register with a government authority in order to offer money transfer services. Almost all states in the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam require us to be licensed to conduct business within their jurisdictions, exercise authority over certain aspects of our business and regularly examine us and our business. 
Our primary overseas operating subsidiary, MoneyGram International SRL, is a licensed payment institution under the National Bank of Belgium pursuant to the European Union Payment Services Directive ("PSD"). The Company, through its subsidiaries, is also licensed in other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom, Mexico and Canada. In 2016, the PSD was amended by a revised Payment Services Directive ("PSD2"), which was implemented in the national law of the member states during or prior to January 2018 and was further amended by the 4th and 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directives in the European Union. Among other changes, the PSD2, as amended, has increased the supervisory powers granted to member states with respect to activities performed by us and our agents in the European Union. We are also subject to increasingly significant licensing or other regulatory requirements in various other jurisdictions. The financial penalties associated with the failure to comply with anti-money laundering laws have increased in recent regulation, including the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive in the EU. These laws have increased and will continue to increase our costs and could also increase competition in some or all of our areas of service. Legislation that has been enacted or proposed in other jurisdictions could have similar effects. 
Licensing requirements in the U.S. and abroad may include minimum net worth requirements, provision of surety bonds or letters of credit, compliance with operational procedures, agent oversight and the maintenance of reserves or "permissible investments" in an amount equivalent to outstanding payment obligations, as defined by our various regulators. The types of securities that are considered "permissible investments" vary across jurisdictions, but generally include cash and cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other highly rated debt instruments. Many regulators require us to file reports on a quarterly or more frequent basis to verify our compliance with their requirements. Many regulators also subject us to periodic examinations and require us and our agents to comply with anti-money laundering and other laws and regulations.
Escheatment Regulations
Unclaimed property laws of every state in the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands require that we track certain information on all our payment instruments and money transfers and, if they are unclaimed at the end of an applicable statutory abandonment period, that we remit the proceeds of the unclaimed property to the appropriate jurisdiction. Statutory abandonment periods for payment instruments and money transfers range from three to seven years. Certain foreign jurisdictions also have unclaimed property laws. These laws are evolving and are frequently unclear and inconsistent among various jurisdictions, making compliance challenging. We have an ongoing program designed to comply with escheatment laws as they apply to our business.
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations
We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, transfer, storage and disposal of personally identifiable information of our consumers, agents and employees. In the U.S., we are subject to various federal privacy laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires that financial institutions provide consumers with privacy notices and have in place policies and procedures regarding the safeguarding of personal information. We are also subject to privacy and data breach laws of various states. Outside the U.S., we are subject to privacy laws of numerous countries and jurisdictions. In some cases, these laws are more restrictive than the U.S. laws and impose more stringent duties on companies or penalties for non-compliance. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union ("GDPR") imposes a higher standard of personal data protection with significant penalties for non-compliance for companies operating in the European Union or doing business with European Union residents. The new California Consumer Protection Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020, imposes heightened data privacy requirements on companies that collect information from California residents and creates a broad set of privacy rights and remedies modeled in part on the GDPR. In addition, government surveillance laws and data localization laws are evolving to address increased and changing threats and risks. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 
Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional regulatory requirements and creates additional regulatory oversight over us. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB. The CFPB's Remittance Transfer Rule became effective on October 28, 2013. Its requirements include: a disclosure requirement to provide consumers sending funds internationally from the U.S. enhanced pre-transaction written disclosures, an obligation to resolve certain errors, including errors that may be outside our control and an obligation to cancel transactions that have not been completed at a customer's request. As a "larger participant" in the market for international money transfers, we are subject to direct examination and supervision by the CFPB. We have modified our systems and consumer disclosures in light of the requirements of the Remittance Transfer Rule. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, it is unlawful for any provider of consumer financial 
products or services to engage in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB has substantial rule making and enforcement authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a financial product or service. 
Non-U.S. Dollar Exchange Regulation 
Our money transfer services are subject to non-U.S. dollar exchange statutes of the U.S., as well as similar state laws and the laws of certain other countries in which we operate. Certain of these statutes require registration or licensure and reporting. Others may impose currency exchange restrictions with which we must comply.
Anti-Bribery Regulation 
We are subject to regulations imposed by the FCPA in the U.S., the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. We are subject to recordkeeping and other requirements imposed upon companies related to compliance with these laws. We maintain a compliance program designed to comply with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulation.
Clearing and Cash Management Bank Relationships
Our business involves the transfer of money on a global basis on behalf of our consumers, our agents and ourselves. We buy and sell a number of global currencies and maintain a network of settlement accounts to facilitate the funding of money transfers and foreign exchange trades to ensure that funds are received on a timely basis. Our relationships with the clearing, trading and cash management banks are critical to an efficient and reliable global funding network.
In the U.S., we have agreements with four active clearing banks that provide clearing and processing functions for official checks, money orders and other draft instruments. We believe that this network of banks provides sufficient capacity to handle the current and projected volumes of items for these services.
We maintain significant relationships with major international banks which provide the capability to transfer money electronically as well as through domestic electronic funds transfer networks and international wire transfer systems. There are a limited number of banks that have capabilities broad enough in scope to handle our volume and complexity. Consequently, we generally employ banks whose market is not limited to their own country or region and have extensive systems capabilities and branch networks that can support settlement needs that are often unique to different countries around the world. In 2013, we activated our participation in the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ("SWIFT") network for international wire transfers, which improves access to all banks in the world while lowering the cost of these funds transfers.
Intellectual Property
The MoneyGram brand is important to our business. We have registered our MoneyGram trademark in the U.S. and in a majority of the other countries in which we do business. We maintain a portfolio of other trademarks that are material to our Company, which are discussed above in the Overview section. In addition, we maintain a portfolio of MoneyGram branded and related domain names.
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright laws and trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights in products, services, expertise and information. We believe the intellectual property rights in processing equipment, computer systems, software and business processes held by us and our subsidiaries provide us with a competitive advantage. We take appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property to the extent such intellectual property can be protected.
Human Capital
Global Talent — At MoneyGram, our people are our most important asset and the success of our global talent (human capital) is essential to the success of our Company. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 898 employees in the U.S. and 2,174 employees globally.
Attracting, recruiting, developing and retaining diverse talent enables us to build a strong and dynamic company. We are focused on supporting our employees across the full employee lifecycle from candidate recruitment through the full employee experience. We have implemented a variety of global and local programs designed to promote employee wellness, particularly during difficult times such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in 2020, we worked with our employees to provide a fully virtual work place, accommodating school, family and health needs of our employees, offering additional training, work-from-home flexibility and increased mental health support through our employee assistance program and our benefits partners. In 2021, we allowed all global employees to determine whether they wanted to return to the office full time, partially, or become permanently virtual employees. We also gave employees greater autonomy over their working hours to better accommodate their personal lives. 
Employee Engagement — At MoneyGram, we provide a variety of employee engagement programs designed to ensure that our employees have a voice in their future and are engaged in our business. We solicit direct employee feedback related to new proposals and programs, and we also have a robust engagement team (“The Red Team”) with representatives across all of our regions and offices, with a focus on employee volunteerism and community service opportunities. We host monthly employee engagement forums and Lunch and Learn discussion on a variety of personal and Company development topics. We also work to keep our employees updated on Company opportunities and developments through quarterly Town Hall meetings with our CEO and full executive leadership team. We offer two paid Community Service days per year where all employees are encouraged to spend time volunteering within their communities. 
Talent Acquisition and Development — As a leading FinTech and digital payments company, we compete for top global talent around the world. We value our employees for who they are as individuals, and we believe that a strong culture focused on respect for each employee as a valuable individual is essential to the successful acquisition, retention and development of diverse talent. To that end, we focus on inclusive hiring, employee development, positive coaching and mentorship and internal and external educational opportunities. We have a robust in-house training program, and we likewise provide opportunities for formal and informal continuing education participation for our employees across their respective areas of expertise. Whether it is through tuition reimbursement, Company-paid certification courses, outside or internal continuing education or simply department-led trainings, we invest in our employees’ development. 
Employee Wellness — We value our employees and work to provide competitive programs to support the total wellness of our employees, including resources, programs and services to support our employees’ physical, mental and financial wellness. We provide a variety of benefits to our employees globally, including a choice of comprehensive health insurance plans, fully-paid maternity and family leave, vacation and holiday time off and retirement planning and financial well-being services in addition to retirement savings opportunities. We also provide fully paid employee time off for employee volunteerism and community service and provide community service opportunities for our employees who wish to participate.
