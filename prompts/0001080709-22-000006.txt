Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel, transformational medicines with optimized pharmacology and pharmacokinetics to patients globally. Our internally developed pipeline includes multiple potentially first- or best-in-class assets with broad clinical utility.
Our most advanced investigational clinical programs include: 
•Etrasimod, which we are evaluating in a Phase 3 program for ulcerative colitis, or UC, a Phase 2b/3 program for Crohn’s disease, or CD, a Phase 2 program in alopecia areata, or AA, and a Phase 2b program for eosinophilic esophagitis, or EoE. We also plan to evaluate etrasimod in a Phase 3 program in atopic dermatitis, or AD. 
•APD418, for acute heart failure, or AHF, which we are evaluating in a Phase 2 trial.
•Temanogrel, a second compound in our cardiovascular therapeutic area, which we are evaluating in a Phase 2 trial for microvascular obstruction, or MVO, and a Phase 2 trial for Raynaud’s phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis, or SSc-RP.
•Olorinab, which we were evaluating for a broad range of visceral pain conditions associated with gastrointestinal diseases. We are evaluating possible strategic options for olorinab. 
We continue to leverage our two decades of world-class G-protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR, target discovery research to develop breakthrough drugs and ultimately deliver these to patients with unmet needs. Our long-term pipeline prospects include a collaboration with Beacon Discovery, Inc., or Beacon, across a broad range of immune-mediated inflammatory targets and compounds.
We have license agreements or collaborations with various companies, including:
•United Therapeutics (ralinepag in a Phase 3 program for pulmonary arterial hypertension),
•Everest Medicines Limited (etrasimod in a Phase 3 program for UC in Greater China and select countries in Asia),
•Beacon Discovery (early research platform for GPCR targets),
•Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (undisclosed orphan GPCR program for central nervous system – preclinical), and
•Aristea Therapeutics (RIST4721 in a Phase 2 program for the treatment of palmoplantar pustulosis and other neutrophil-mediated diseases).
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our workforce began working from home in March 2020, either all or substantially all of the time, and continues to do so as of the date of this filing. While many jurisdictions have lifted COVID-19-related restrictions, the continued spread of the coronavirus and its variants continues to cause a risk of potential delays in site initiation and participant enrollment and screening rates in certain of our clinical development programs. The potential impact, if any, that these site-level delays could have on our development program timelines remains uncertain, depending on a variety of factors including vaccination rates, which vary greatly from region to region, and the emergence and spread of new variants of the coronavirus. Our future research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses may vary significantly if we experience an increased impact from COVID-19 on the costs and timing associated with the conduct of our clinical trials and other related business activities.

•Prudently build a vibrant, sustainable, high-performing organization.
Pipeline of Development Programs
Below is a summary of our internally developed, proprietary portfolio: 
Etrasimod Program
Etrasimod is a next-generation, oral, highly selective sphingosine 1-phosphate, or S1P, receptor modulator, discovered by Arena, designed to provide systemic and local cell modulation by selectively targeting S1P receptor subtypes 1, 4 and 5. S1P receptors have been demonstrated to be involved in the modulation of several biological responses, including lymphocyte trafficking from lymph nodes to the peripheral blood. By isolating subpopulations of lymphocytes in lymph nodes, fewer immune cells are available in the circulating blood to effect tissue damage. Etrasimod has therapeutic 
potential in immune-mediated inflammatory disease areas including gastroenterology and dermatology. We are currently evaluating etrasimod in ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, atopic dermatitis, and alopecia areata. 
Gastrointestinal Diseases
Inflammatory bowel diseases
Inflammatory bowel diseases, or IBD, like UC and CD are chronic life-long immune-mediated inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that affect approximately 1.7 million patients in the United States, or US, alone. The prevalence of UC and CD in the US are currently estimated at approximately 0.9 million and 0.8 million patients, respectively. The prevalence of IBD in France, Germany, Italy and Spain collectively, or EU4, and the United Kingdom, is estimated at 1.3 million with approximately 0.7 million patients with UC and 0.6 million patients with CD. Both conditions represent a significant burden to patients, including hospitalization, surgery, and a longer-term risk of colon cancer, as well as impaired quality of life, economic productivity and social functioning. Additionally, Japan has an estimated prevalence of approximately 0.2 million IBD patients. In aggregate, there are approximately 3.2 million patients across the US, EU4, the United Kingdom, and Japan that are currently living with IBD.
UC is characterized by contiguous mucosal inflammation limited to the colon which involves the rectum in approximately 95% of cases and may extend to involve parts or all of the large intestine. In contrast, CD is characterized by full thickness inflammation that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract but most typically involves the terminal ileum and colon; and causes fistulation and scarring. Symptoms for UC and CD can vary, depending on the location and severity of inflammation, but some of the most common are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and rectal bleeding. 
An important goal of therapy for IBD is durable remission while improving the patient’s quality of life. Although a number of therapies are approved for the treatment of IBD, they are often associated with an inability to induce or maintain remission, serious side effects, and complicated administration regimens. There is therefore an unmet medical need for novel oral agents with an enhanced risk-benefit profile and more convenient administration for the treatment of moderately to severely active IBD.
Eosinophilic Esophagitis
Eosinophilic esophagitis, or EoE, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting, immune mediated disease of the esophagus driven by an allergic Th2 T cell inflammatory profile. Histologically, EoE is characterized by the accumulation of eosinophils in the lining of the esophagus, a tissue that under normal conditions lacks these cells. In addition to eosinophils, CD4 and CD8 T cells, dendritic cells and mast cells increase in the tissue. The presence of these unwelcome inflammatory cells has been shown to have a direct effect on immune function and tissue damage. Both pediatric and adult populations can develop EoE, however, the disorder is most common in individuals between the ages of 20 and 40 years old. EoE also exhibits a strong hereditability pattern and predominance for males and for Caucasians, and principally in socioeconomically developed countries. EoE affects approximately 135,000 patients of all ages in the US and an estimated 132,000 patients in the EU4 and United Kingdom. There are no approved therapies in the US for the treatment of EoE. We believe that etrasimod may represent a significant opportunity to provide an effective treatment to EoE due to its potential to modulate the trafficking of multiple immune subsets.
Dermatologic Conditions
Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis, or AD, is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by dry skin, pruritus, and relapsing lesions. AD has a severe impact on quality of life, including potential occupational, social, and psychological impairments. The adult diagnosed prevalence is approximately 8.5 million patients in the US, and 6.5 million patients in the EU4 and United Kingdom. According to a recent survey with dermatologists in the US, 55% of dermatologists reported a high unmet need in atopic dermatitis.
Two new therapies have been marketed in the US since 2016, however these treatments have less desirable administration routes and are not effective in all patients. Therefore, we believe a significant unmet need remains for differentiated, safe, oral agents that are effective and have a favorable side effect profile. AD pathology is driven by a combination of impaired skin epithelial barriers, altered microbiota, and aberrant inflammation driven by activated immune cells, including skin-infiltrating T cells and dendritic cells, or DCs. Etrasimod may have the potential to reduce DC migration/activation (S1P receptor subtypes 1 and 4 mediated) and T cell infiltration (S1P receptor subtype 1 mediated) in 
the skin. These effects could reduce the T cell-mediated inflammation in the skin that underlies atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. 
Alopecia Areata
Alopecia areata is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune skin disorder with unmet medical need that causes non-scarring patchy hair loss, most often on the scalp. The prevalence is approximately 2.6 million patients in the US and 2.1 million in the EU4 and United Kingdom.
The disease may be limited to 1 or more discrete, round or oval patches of hair loss the size of a coin on the scalp, or it may progress to full hair loss of the scalp (alopecia totalis) or the entire body (alopecia universalis). The course of disease is unpredictable, with spontaneous regrowth of hair occurring in 80% of patients within the first year, and sudden relapse at any given time. Patients with extensive disease (at least 50% total scalp hair loss) rarely have spontaneous hair regrowth. Patients with persistent moderate-to-severe AA also often suffer tremendous emotional and psychosocial distress and reduced quality of life as a result of their hair loss. Thus, psychosocial support and therapy is an important part of disease management, as this often-disfiguring disease can be psychosocially burdensome. The estimated lifetime risk of AA is 2% among the general population and represents the second most common form of human hair loss, second only to androgenetic alopecia. The current standard of care is injected corticosteroids which have limitations in terms of efficacy. Etrasimod may have the potential to reduce circulating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes available to infiltrate the hair follicle which may decrease inflammation and restore hair growth.
Etrasimod Development
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
We are currently in a Phase 3 program in UC and a Phase 2b/3 program in CD. 
ELEVATE UC constitutes our Phase 3 global registrational program to assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily etrasimod 2 mg in participants with moderately to severely active UC. In January 2021, the pivotal, 52-week ELEVATE UC 52 trial completed enrollment. In August 2021, the pivotal, 12-week ELEVATE UC 12 trial reached full enrollment. We expect topline data from both ELEVATE UC 12 and ELEVATE UC 52 in the first quarter of 2022.
In April 2021, we enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2 trial evaluating etrasimod for the potential treatment of moderately active UC, called GLADIATOR UC. This trial is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled 52-week trial to assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily etrasimod 2 mg in participants with moderately active UC. This trial is intended to evaluate etrasimod in a less severe patient population than ELEVATE UC, potentially broadening the patient population and demonstrating the potential use of a once-a-day oral therapy earlier in the treatment paradigm.
In August 2021, we increased the target enrollment for our Phase 2/3 CULTIVATE Study A for etrasimod in CD from 50 to 70 participants and reached target enrollment in November 2021. We expect dose-ranging data to read out in the second quarter of 2022. Study A is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized 14-week trial, intended to provide supportive data for dose selection evaluating 2 mg and 3 mg etrasimod in subjects with moderately to severely active CD. The Phase 2/3 program also consists of a Phase 2b dose-ranging multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily etrasimod in participants with moderately to severely active CD. The Phase 3 portion of the program will include two induction trials, with re-randomization of clinical responders into a single maintenance trial. The program is intended to provide an operationally seamless transition from Phase 2 to Phase 3. We have withdrawn previously announced overall program guidance for CULTIVATE based on the expected COVID-19 impact on trial execution, including site activation and participant enrollment.
In 2019, we announced positive results from a 34-week open-label extension, or OLE, of the Phase 2 OASIS trial of etrasimod for the treatment of UC. The trial enrolled 118 participants (84% of OASIS study completers), of which 22 completers also received 2 mg in OASIS, for a total of 46 weeks of treatment with etrasimod. Overall, etrasimod demonstrated durable, long-term clinical remission and was generally well tolerated in this trial. Adverse events in the OLE study were generally mild to moderate in severity and no new safety findings were noted. Impact on heart rate and atrioventricular, or AV, conduction was minimal throughout the study with no discontinuations from study related to bradycardia or AV block.
In 2018, we announced topline results from OASIS, a dose finding 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multinational Phase 2 clinical trial of etrasimod in moderate to severe UC. The aim of the trial was to 
investigate dose response and compare the active arm(s) to placebo. The trial evaluated the effects of etrasimod at 1 mg and 2 mg versus placebo on multiple efficacy measures including a three-component partial Mayo Clinic Score, clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement in 156 participants. Etrasimod demonstrated a clear dose response and statistically significant improvements versus placebo in the primary, all secondary, and clinical remission endpoints at the 2 mg dose. There were fewer participants with serious adverse events, or SAEs, compared to placebo (0% in 2 mg, 5.8% in 1 mg and 11.1% in placebo). Impact on heart rate and AV conduction was low throughout the study with no discontinuations from study related to bradycardia or AV block. There were no increases in liver function tests compared to placebo and no reports of macular edema or pulmonary function test abnormalities. In this trial, etrasimod was well tolerated.
Eosinophilic Esophagitis
We are recruiting for a Phase 2b program for EoE. In February 2021, we dosed the first participant in the Phase 2b VOYAGE trial for etrasimod in EoE. Our Phase 2b VOYAGE trial of etrasimod is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, with a primary efficacy measurement at week 16 and a secondary efficacy analysis at week 24, to assess the safety and efficacy of 1 mg and 2 mg etrasimod in approximately 100 adult participants with EoE. In June 2021, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation status to etrasimod for the treatment of EoE.
Atopic Dermatitis
We are currently in planning for a Phase 3 program for AD and have ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities on trial design. 
In July 2021, we evaluated an updated open-label extension data set from the Phase 2 ADVISE trial for 2 mg etrasimod in atopic dermatitis that demonstrated meaningful effects at week 16 of the OLE period on validated Investigator Global Assessment, or vIGA, at 47%, Eczema Area and Severity Index, or EASI-75, at 72%, and Peak Pruritis Numeric Rating Scale, or PP-NRS, at 61% with consistent safety profile out to one year.
In 2020, we announced topline results from ADVISE, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial evaluating safety and efficacy of once-daily etrasimod in approximately 140 participants with moderate to severe AD. The primary endpoint measured was percent change in EASI from baseline to week 12, followed by a 4-week follow-up observation period. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants achieving EASI-75, proportion of participants with a vIGA 0 to 1, and percent change in peak pruritis. In the primary analysis, nearly one-third of participants in the 2 mg etrasimod group achieved clear or almost clear skin, as defined by the vIGA, which is the FDA endpoint for Phase 3 registration. The vIGA improvement was statistically significant as compared to placebo at 12 weeks. Across EASI-75 and peak change in pruritis, etrasimod 2 mg demonstrated early and statistically significant effect at week 4. Etrasimod did not meet the Phase 2b primary endpoint of EASI change from baseline at week 12 as compared to placebo. Between weeks 4-8, the trial was impacted by unwarranted dose interruption in 19% (n=9) of the etrasimod 2 mg group. Adjusting for this dose interruption, a post-hoc Completer Analysis, which included only those participants receiving full therapeutic exposure of etrasimod 2 mg, showed statistically significant effect on the EASI score compared to placebo (weeks 4 and 12), EASI-75 at week 4, vIGA at week 12 and pruritis through week 8. The Completer Analysis also showed no plateau of effect over the 12-week trial. Overall, the safety profile was consistent with previous trials of etrasimod including low first-dose heart rate effect with no titration, and no serious adverse events across the groups. Additionally, none of the other adverse events commonly associated with first-generation S1P receptor modulators were seen in this trial.
Alopecia Areata
We are currently recruiting a Phase 2 program in Alopecia Areata.
In July 2021, the Phase 2 trial for etrasimod in AA was amended to add a 3 mg cohort and expand patient population subtypes. The Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial will assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily etrasimod 2 mg and 3 mg in 78 participants with moderate-to-severe AA. We expect to announce topline data for this trial in the second half of 2022.
Etrasimod Controlled-Release Formulation
In April 2020, we announced data from a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating a controlled-release delivery profile for etrasimod. 
The controlled-release profiles were designed to retain etrasimod's rapid onset of action while further improving its potentially best-in-class non-titrated, low intrinsic first-dose heart rate effect. A controlled-release formulation has the potential to deliver rapid life-cycle management and extend etrasimod's intellectual property portfolio.
Based on the results, we have initiated a product development program. 
Prior Development
In January 2015, we announced top-line results from a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial for etrasimod. In this trial, etrasimod demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on lymphocyte count lowering in blood, with mean decreases from baseline of up to 69%. Lymphocyte counts, on average, recovered to baseline within one week of conclusion of dosing. There was a modest impact on heart rate, but none of the changes were classified by the investigator as clinically significant. There were also no findings with respect to pulmonary function or liver enzyme tests that were classified by the investigator as clinically significant. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate contact dermatitis, headache, constipation and diarrhea, with none being clearly drug related. There were no discontinuations for adverse events, and no serious adverse events were observed.
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of etrasimod. In five different dosing cohorts, 50 healthy volunteers received etrasimod and 10 healthy volunteers received placebo for 21 days.
Prior to commencing the Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial for etrasimod, we completed a Phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of the compound. This randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of etrasimod in 40 healthy adult volunteers. In the trial, etrasimod demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects, a dose-responsive reduction in blood lymphocyte count and a slowing of heart rate that appears comparable to other S1P receptor modulators. The terminal half-life was approximately 35 hours.
Etrasimod Intellectual Property
As of February 4, 2022, we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for etrasimod and related compounds, and methods of treatment utilizing etrasimod and related compounds, in 62 jurisdictions, including the United States, China, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Spain, Canada, India, Russia, South Korea and Australia. The earliest priority date for the patents on etrasimod is 2008. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2029 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications.
APD418 Program
APD418 is a potential first-in-class β3-adrenergic receptor (AdrR) antagonist and cardiac myotrope designed to regulate myofilament calcium sensitivity in order to improve contractility without inducing the serious adverse events associated with currently available inotropes. APD418 is in early-stage clinical development for patients with AHF.
AHF is broadly defined as a rapid onset of new or worsening signs and symptoms of HF. It is a potentially life-threatening condition, requiring hospitalization, and emergency treatment is aimed predominantly at managing fluid overload and achieving hemodynamic stability. In most cases, hospitalization for AHF results when the neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms, which act to maintain hemodynamic stability in chronic heart failure, are inadequate.
Management of AHF is focused on treating clinical conditions and precipitating factors, immediate stabilization, and symptom relief. Most patients presenting to the emergency department with AHF are congested and have normal to high blood pressures. Diuretics are first line therapy to treat volume overload including congestion; vasodilators are also used as first line therapy for symptom relief in normotensive and hypertensive patients who fail to respond adequately to diuretics. Unfortunately, neither diuretics nor vasodilators have been associated with improved survival.
For patients presenting as hypotensive, who are at the highest risk of mortality, and patients who fail to adequately respond to initial therapy, treatment options are particularly limited and may require the use of inotropic agents. These agents are associated with significant risk of unwanted hemodynamic effects, arrhythmias, and pathway dependent cardiotoxicity, leading to adverse outcomes and increased mortality.
Arena is developing APD418, an internally discovered and developed investigational drug candidate, to address the significant unmet need in AHF.
APD418 Development
In July 2021, we announced that a Phase 2 trial for APD418 was initiated. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is intended to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and effect on cardiac function of intravenous APD418 in approximately 80 adult participants with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
In November 2020, we announced the completion of a first-in-human Phase 1 safety and tolerability trial of APD418. The trial found APD418 was generally well tolerated. 
The FDA has granted us Fast Track designation for development of APD418 in AHF.
APD418 Intellectual Property
As of February 4, 2022, we owned issued patents covering compositions of matter for APD418 and related compounds, and methods of treatment utilizing APD418 and related compounds, in the United States, Japan, Australia, and three other jurisdictions, and we had applications pending in 37 other jurisdictions, of which the ones with the largest pharmaceutical markets were Europe and China. The earliest priority date for the patents on APD418 is 2016. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2037 without taking into account any patent term extension.
Temanogrel Program
Temanogrel is a peripherally acting and selective 5HT2a inverse agonist designed to inhibit serotonin (5-HT)-mediated amplification of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.
Microvascular Obstruction
A significant proportion of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, for treatment of acute coronary syndrome, or ACS, fail to achieve full myocardial or microcirculatory reperfusion despite resolution of the epicardial coronary occlusion. This condition is referred to as MVO and has been reported in approximately 40% to 60% patients undergoing PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infraction, or STEMI, and approximately 30% patients undergoing PCI for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, or NSTEMI, with the greatest incidence in high-risk NSTEMI patients. Importantly, the presence of MVO post-PCI has been associated with worse clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization for heart failure, related to suboptimal cardiac function and recovery in the days and months following the PCI procedure.
During PCI, platelets become activated following rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque, which can be either procedure-induced or occur spontaneously. Upon activation, platelets release 5-HT in substantial quantities. Serotonin acts on 5-HT2A receptors on platelets and smooth muscle cells, resulting in amplification of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, both of which may detrimentally affect the microcirculation. We believe blocking these 5-HT-mediated effects with temanogrel during and following PCI for STEMI and NSTEMI may prevent or minimize the development of MVO and facilitate cardiac functional recovery, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.
Raynaud’s Phenomenon Secondary to Systemic Sclerosis
Raynaud’s phenomenon in SSc is associated with more severe disease manifestation owing to a complex underlying pathophysiology, including vasculopathy and endothelial dysfunction, which detrimentally affect the microcirculation. Intravascular factors, including platelet activation and 5-HT release, likely also contribute to Raynaud’s phenomenon in SSc.
Raynaud’s phenomenon in SSc is commonly triggered by cold temperature, which is known to enhance activation of platelets. In addition, platelets from SSc patients have an increased aggregation response to collagen or 5-HT compared to platelets from healthy individuals, suggesting hypersensitivity of platelets may contribute to the elevated levels of 5-HT observed in patients with SSc-RP. It has been reported that 5-HT induces arterial vasoconstriction and reduces blood flow in human hands to a similar extent as observed with exposure to cold, and that 5-HT2A blockade attenuates these 5-HT-induced effects. In addition, enhanced vasoconstriction response to 5-HT has been observed in SSc patients compared to healthy individuals.
Importantly, the relevance of 5-HT and the 5-HT2A pathway in SSc-RP has been evaluated in clinical studies using ketanserin and sarpogrelate, which indicated that 5-HT2A antagonism may provide beneficial effects on both digital blood flow and improvement of Raynaud’s symptoms.
Temanogrel Development
Microvascular Obstruction
We are recruiting for a Phase 2b program for MVO. 
In June 2021, the first participant was randomized in the Phase 2 trial for temanogrel in MVO. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is intended to evaluate the safety and effect on MVO of intravenous temanogrel in approximately 99 adult participants undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.
The FDA has granted us Fast Track designation for development of temanogrel for MVO.
Raynaud’s Phenomenon Secondary to Systemic Sclerosis
We are recruiting for a Phase 2b program for SSc-RP.
In November 2021, the first participant was randomized in the Phase 2 trial for temanogrel in SSc-RP. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial is intended to evaluate the safety and effect of oral temanogrel on digital blood flow in approximately 48 participants with SSc-RP.
Prior Development
We have completed four Phase 1 studies with the oral formulation and one Phase 1 study with the IV formulation of temanogrel.
Temanogrel Intellectual Property
As of February 4, 2022, we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for temanogrel and related compounds, and methods of treatment utilizing temanogrel and related compounds, in 9 jurisdictions, including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Spain. The earliest priority date for the patents on temanogrel is 2004. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2025 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications.
Olorinab Program
Olorinab, a potentially first-in-class, orally available, potent, peripherally acting, highly selective, full agonist of the CB2 receptor, is an internally discovered investigational drug candidate for the treatment of visceral pain.
The CB2 receptor is expressed in the GI nervous system, and in many tissues and organs of the abdomen. CB2 receptors are found on immune cells but also on microglia, terminal neurons, dorsal root ganglia, and on visceral sensory neurons. We believe selectively targeting the CB2 receptor may provide therapeutic benefit for visceral pain without the potential for dependence, abuse, and GI and cardiovascular side effects associated with opiates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which are among the most common pain relievers. In addition to analgesic effects, olorinab may have anti-inflammatory properties. 
Olorinab is designed to be a peripherally acting and selective CB2 receptor agonist and is intended to provide pain relief without the unwanted side effects associated with CB1 receptor activation.
Olorinab Development
In March 2021, we announced topline results from the CAPTIVATE trial for treatment of abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome and showed that although olorinab was well tolerated it did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of statistically significant improvement in the overall AAPS from baseline to week 12. CAPTIVATE was a Phase 2, 4-arm multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial to assess the safety and efficacy of olorinab administered three times daily in 273 participants. In CAPTIVATE participants were randomized to placebo, 10 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg. A pre-specified analysis assessed participants with baseline AAPS ≥ 6.5 (median), representing those 
with moderate to severe pain. This subgroup accounted for 50% of the overall study population. Within this subgroup, the 50 mg treatment group showed a clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p=0.01) reduction in AAPS of 1.64 points compared to placebo and 3.93 points from baseline at week 12. Olorinab was generally safe and well tolerated in the study, consistent with the safety profile of previous trials. Discontinuation rates and adverse events were similar to placebo, notably with no worsening of bowel habits and no treatment interruptions. There were no serious adverse events observed in the study. We are evaluating possible strategic options for olorinab.
Prior Development
In 2018, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 2a trial of olorinab in development for the treatment of pain associated with CD. This exploratory study was an open‑label investigation to evaluate safety and tolerability of olorinab in this patient population and to gain initial insights into its efficacy via a pain visual analog scale, or VAS. Fourteen participants were enrolled into two cohorts at 25 mg and 100 mg administered three times daily for up to eight weeks. Reductions in pain were seen within the first week of treatment and statistically significant improvement from baseline in Average Abdominal Pain Score, or AAPS, at weeks four and eight. In this trial, olorinab appeared generally well tolerated with no clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure, no psychotropic effects, and no discontinuations due to adverse events. 
In April 2016, we announced favorable results from a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial of olorinab. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial enrolled 36 healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of olorinab. Cohorts of 12 subjects (nine active, three placebo) were administered doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg of olorinab or placebo three times daily for 10 days and, in connection with the pharmacokinetic evaluation, one time on the 11th day. The most common adverse events were headache and nausea. All adverse events were classified as mild, and there were no serious adverse events reported. There was one discontinuation in the high-dose group due to an adverse event of mild thirst and somnolence. Reductions in blood pressure and heart rate were observed, but none were symptomatic or resulted in an adverse event. Drug levels at all doses tested in the trial, including the lowest dose, were well above those believed to be needed to stimulate the CB2 receptor.
In April 2015, we announced favorable top-line results from a Phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of olorinab. The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial enrolled 56 healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of olorinab. Dose-responsive exposure was observed over the explored dose range of 10-400 mg with good tolerability at all doses administered.
Olorinab Intellectual Property
As of February 4, 2022, we owned issued patents covering compositions of matter for olorinab and related compounds, and methods of treatment utilizing olorinab and related compounds, in 23 jurisdictions, including the United States, China, Japan, Canada, India, Russia, South Korea and Australia, and we had applications pending in 8 other jurisdictions, of which the ones with the largest pharmaceutical markets were Europe, Venezuela, and Brazil. The earliest priority date for the patents on olorinab is 2009. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2030 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications.
Additional Internal Preclinical and Clinical Programs
In January 2020, we entered an agreement with Beacon Discovery for the development of multiple novel, early stage, oral autoimmune programs. The multiple G-protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR, targets in this collaboration with Beacon Discovery and their associated chemistry represent the next generation of oral compounds which, if successfully developed and approved, may transform the way autoimmune diseases are approached and treated. This collaboration includes both novel and validated targets and compounds. 
We have additional assets, including other 5-HT2A modulators, which are either in or being evaluated for future clinical and preclinical development. We are also evaluating additional delivery forms of the products in our pipeline to extend clinical utility or improve the product profile.
Collaborations and License Agreements
We have strategic collaborations and licenses with pharmaceutical companies, including United Therapeutics, Everest Medicines Limited, or Everest, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, Beacon, Eisai, and Aristea Therapeutics, Inc., or Aristea.
Aristea Collaboration and Option Agreement
In July 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement to advance the clinical development of RIST4721, an oral CXCR2 antagonist being developed by Aristea for the treatment of palmoplantar pustulosis (“PPP”) and other neutrophil-mediated diseases.
Under the terms of the agreement, we paid $60.0 million upfront to Aristea and invested $10.0 million in Aristea’s Series B preferred stock, both of which were paid in July 2021. In return, Aristea granted us an exclusive option to acquire Aristea, including rights to all CXCR2 programs, upon completion of the Phase 2b study of RIST4721 in PPP. The agreement also provided a framework during the option period for the companies to jointly explore the development of additional neutrophil-mediated diseases, including hidradenitis suppurativa and inflammatory bowel disease. 
United Therapeutics License Agreement
In November 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with United Therapeutics. Under the United Therapeutics Agreement, we granted United Therapeutics an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize ralinepag. This transaction was completed in January 2019. At the closing of the transaction, we transferred to United Therapeutics certain other assets relating to ralinepag, including, among others, related domain names and trademarks, permits, certain contracts, inventory, regulatory documentation, IND, and non-clinical, pre-clinical and clinical trial data. United Therapeutics has agreed to assume certain limited liabilities, including, among others, all post-closing obligations under assumed contracts and the IND. United Therapeutics is responsible for all development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products globally. 
Upon the closing of this transaction, in January 2019, we received an upfront payment of $800.0 million. We are eligible to receive a payment of $150.0 million upon first marketing approval of ralinepag in a major non-US market, and a payment of $250.0 million upon US marketing approval of an inhaled formulation of ralinepag. In addition, we are entitled to receive low double-digit, tiered royalties on net sales of ralinepag products, subject to certain adjustments for third-party license payments.
The United Therapeutics Agreement contains various representations and warranties of Arena and United Therapeutics, and various covenants of the parties, including covenants to cooperate in seeking regulatory approvals, as well as our agreement not to compete, during the period in which royalties are payable (or during the five-year period following the closing if we are subject to a change of control transaction) in the development of a prostacyclin to treat pulmonary hypertension. 
Ralinepag Program
Ralinepag is in a Phase 3 program for pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Ralinepag is a next-generation potent, highly selective oral IP receptor agonist intended for the treatment of PAH. Ralinepag was designed by us to deliver intravenous prostacyclin-like potency and pharmacokinetics in an oral tablet. In non-clinical experiments, ralinepag demonstrated potentially best-in-class activation of the IP receptor resulting in vasodilation, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Additionally, early-stage studies of ralinepag pharmacokinetics in humans revealed an approximately 24-hour half-life and a low peak-to-trough ratio supporting therapeutic blood levels with once daily dosing.
Ralinepag was granted orphan drug status for the treatment of PAH by the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in September 2014, and by the European Medicines Agency in January 2019. 
PAH is a progressive, life-threatening disorder characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. PAH occurs when the pulmonary arteries thicken or grow rigid. This makes blood flow more difficult. The heart must work harder to push blood through the arteries, and the arteries are unable to carry adequate blood to the lungs. The increased pressure strains the heart, which can limit physical activity, result in heart failure and reduce life expectancy. PAH will continue to worsen over time, even with proper treatment. Based on data from the Registry to EValuate Early And Long-term PAH disease management, or REVEAL, of patients in the US, there is an estimated five-year survival rate of 57% from diagnosis.
PAH involves several interrelated mechanisms, with prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 playing a major role in maintaining pulmonary vascular tone through their balanced activity. Prostacyclin, released by endothelial cells, promotes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation. Prostacyclin also has antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle. Despite treatment guidelines, targeting the prostacyclin pathway has been primarily reserved for patients with advanced disease due to limitations of currently available options including parenteral prostacyclins which are the only PAH treatment that have demonstrated a mortality benefit.
Everest Collaboration
In December 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Everest Agreement, with Everest regarding the development and commercialization of ralinepag and etrasimod in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, or the Everest Territories. In January 2019, we and Everest amended the Everest Agreement by entering into two separate agreements, one for each of ralinepag and etrasimod, with the terms for each program that are substantially the same as in the original Everest Agreement. Under the United Therapeutics Agreement, we assigned the separate Everest Agreement related to ralinepag to United Therapeutics.
Under the separate Everest Agreement related to etrasimod, we granted Everest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize etrasimod (in oral formulations only), in the Everest Territories.
Everest is responsible for all development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products in the Everest Territories, and may participate in the portion of our global clinical trials that is conducted in the Everest Territories.
We are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments from Everest, as well as tiered royalties on net sales ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. Following an initial royalty term, we are eligible to receive a lower trademark royalty if Everest continues to use our licensed product-related trademarks.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, the National Medical Products Administration of China, formerly known as the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, accepted the initial clinical trial applications for an oral formulation of ralinepag and for etrasimod. Subsequently, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Everest announced that the first subject has been dosed in a Phase 3 trial evaluating etrasimod in development for the treatment of UC in Greater China and South Korea. This Phase 3 trial is ongoing. 
Boehringer Ingelheim Collaboration
In 2015, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, to conduct joint research to identify drug candidates targeting a GPCR that belongs to a group of orphan central nervous system, or CNS, receptors. An “orphan receptor” is structurally related to a family of proteins that are known to act as functional cell-surface receptors but whose ligand has not yet been identified. A lead molecule is currently in preclinical development.
In the past, we contracted with Beacon to perform our research obligations under the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration. In exchange, we agreed to share limited near-term milestones with Beacon as well as the full-time equivalent funding paid to us by Boehringer Ingelheim. We have retained the longer-term success milestones and all royalties. 
Beacon Discovery Agreements
In the first quarter of 2021, we received a $1.1 million payment as a result of the merger (“Merger”) between Eurofins Beacon Discovery Holdings, Inc. (“Eurofins”) and Beacon. This payment satisfied Beacon’s obligation to pay us a percentage of the consideration for such sale transaction in the event that Beacon was sold as outlined in the 2016 License and Collaboration Agreement. We are eligible to receive future contingent consideration payments based on certain performance metrics achieved by Beacon over a four-year performance period through the first quarter of 2025 up to an aggregate of $2.0 million.
Following the Merger, we entered into a Consent and Release Agreement that terminated the Company’s rights of negotiation and rights of first refusal to potentially obtain licenses to certain compounds discovered and developed by Beacon. In addition, the Consent and Release Agreement terminated our right, under the 2016 License and Collaboration Agreement, to receive any revenue received by Beacon including upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties. The 2020 Collaboration and License Agreement with Beacon remains in effect and was not impacted by the Merger.
In January 2020, we entered into a multi-year strategic Collaboration and License Agreement with Beacon, aimed at building novel medicines across a range of GPCR targets believed to play a role in immune and inflammatory 
diseases. Under the terms of this agreement, Beacon is responsible for early drug discovery activities and Arena will be responsible for any potential future development and, ultimately, commercialization activities. We are required to pay to Beacon research initiation fees, make quarterly research funding payments for the duration of Beacon’s research activities as well as research, development and regulatory milestone payments. We are also obligated to pay Beacon tiered royalties on net sales of low single digits levels.
Beginning in September 2016, we entered into a series of agreements with Beacon. 
In 2016, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Beacon, pursuant to which we granted Beacon a non-exclusive, non-assignable and non-sublicensable license to certain database information relating to compounds, receptors and pharmacology, and transferred certain equipment to Beacon. Beacon will seek to engage global partners to facilitate discovery and development. Beacon has agreed to assign to us any intellectual property relating to our existing research and development programs developed in the course of performing research for us and grant us a non-exclusive license to any intellectual property developed outside the course of performing work for us that is reasonably necessary or useful for developing or commercializing the products under our research and development programs. We are also entitled to rights of negotiation and rights of first refusal to potentially obtain licenses to certain compounds discovered and developed by Beacon. In addition, we are entitled to receive (i) a percentage of any revenue received by Beacon on or after the second anniversary of the effective date of the agreement from any third party pursuant to a third-party license, including upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties; (ii) single-digit royalties on the aggregate net sales of any related products sold by Beacon and its affiliates; and (iii) in the event that Beacon is sold, a percentage of the consideration for such sale transaction.
In 2016, we also entered into a Master Services Agreement with Beacon, pursuant to which Beacon performs certain other research services for us relating to our proprietary pipeline.
Eisai Agreement
In December 2016, we entered into a Transaction Agreement with Eisai regarding lorcaserin. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we granted Eisai an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, or transferred intellectual property, to develop, manufacture and commercialize lorcaserin in all countries and territories of the world. Under the Transaction Agreement we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments starting at 9.5% on net sales of lorcaserin. 
Lorcaserin was approved for marketing in the US, and in certain other territories, for the indication of weight management. On February 13, 2020, the FDA issued a drug safety communication announcing that it requested Eisai voluntarily withdraw lorcaserin from the US market based on the FDA’s analysis of data from the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Effects of Lorcaserin in Overweight and Obese Patients – Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 61 (CAMELLIA-TIMI 61) study, and that Eisai has submitted a request to voluntarily withdraw lorcaserin from the US market. On September 30, 2020, Eisai announced that, after consulting with the FDA, it is continuing the lorcaserin expanded access program and has initiated a Phase 3 clinical study of lorcaserin in patients with Dravet syndrome, a severe type of epilepsy characterized by prolonged seizures that begin in the first year of life.

In October 2020, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement with Longboard pursuant to which Longboard purchased from us the right to receive all milestone payments, royalties, interest and other payments relating to net sales of lorcaserin owed or otherwise payable by Eisai. 
We believe that Eisai is solely responsible for any expenses and losses associated with product liability claims, except we and Eisai share 50% of losses for any alleged defective manufacturing of lorcaserin that was manufactured by us prior to entering into the Transaction Agreement.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our compounds and information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection for our key inventions, including drug candidates we identify, routes for chemical synthesis, pharmaceutical formulations and methods of treatment.
There is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue, or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant product or method. In addition, we regularly review our 
patent portfolio to identify patents and patent applications for potential abandonment that we deem to have relatively low value to our ongoing business operations. There is also no assurance that we will correctly identify which of our patents and patent applications should be maintained and which should be abandoned. The term of most of our current patents commenced, and most of our future patents, if any, will commence, on the date of issuance and terminate 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. Because any marketing and regulatory approval for a drug often occurs several years after the related patent application is filed, the resulting exclusivity afforded by any patent on our drug candidates will likely be substantially less than 20 years.
In the United States, patent term adjustment is available for certain delays in patent office proceedings. In addition, under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, or PTE. PTE permits patent term restoration of a US patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an Investigational New Drug, or IND (falling after issuance of the patent), and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. The application for PTE is subject to approval by the US Patent and Trademark Office in conjunction with the FDA.
Outside of the United States, similar provisions may be available in the European Union, Japan, South Korea and some other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. The length of any such extension may vary by country. Our European patents may be eligible for supplemental protection certificates of up to five years in one or more countries.
Due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions, there is no assurance that our patents will be afforded extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval.
In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information, all of our employees are required to enter into and adhere to an employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement, and invention disclosure procedures as a condition of employment. Additionally, our employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreements require that our employees not bring to us, or use without proper authorization, any third-party proprietary technology. We also generally require our consultants and collaborators that have access to proprietary property and information to execute confidentiality and invention rights agreements in our favor. While such arrangements are intended to enable us to better control the use and disclosure of our proprietary property and provide for our ownership of proprietary technology developed on our behalf, they may not provide us with meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapid and significant change. We face significant competition from many organizations with drugs or drug candidates that do or may compete with drug candidates we are developing. We may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations, which include many large, well-financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies.

Developments by others may render our drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, and we or our collaborators may not be successful in developing either first- or best-in-class drugs.
Etrasimod is currently in development for the treatment of IBD, including in a Phase 3 program in UC and in a Phase 2b/3 program in CD. If approved in IBD, etrasimod would compete with generic drugs, branded oral agents, biologics and biosimilars. There are multiple FDA-approved products for treatment of moderate-to-severe IBD. Many of these products are biologics and include but are not limited to adalimumab by AbbVie, vedolizumab by an affiliate of Takeda Pharmaceuticals, and infliximab and ustekinumab by Janssen Biotech. Additionally, there are approved biosimilar agents to infliximab. There are also approved oral agents, including tofacitinib by Pfizer, as well as multiple oral agents in development. Ozanimod, by Bristol Myers Squibb, or BMS, is an S1P receptor modulator that is approved for use in multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. There are also JAK inhibitors in development, including but not limited to filgotinib by Gilead Sciences and Galapagos, and upadacitinib by AbbVie. In addition oral generic agents such as 
mesalamine and methotrexate are used in the treatment of IBD. There are multiple IL-23 biologics in development for IBD, including Tremfya (guselkumab) by Jannsen Biotech, Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) by AbbVie and mirikizumab by Eli Lilly. There are also oral TYK2 inhibitors in development for IBD, including deucravacitinib by Bristol Myers Squibb. 
Etrasimod has completed a Phase 2 study in AD and we intend to advance into a Phase 3 program for etrasimod in AD. If approved for that indication, etrasimod would compete with generic topical agents, branded topical agents, oral agents, and biologics. Currently AD patients are treated with generic topical steroids, generic topical calcineurin inhibitors, oral generic agents including cyclosporine and methotrexate, and a branded biologic agent, dupilumab, from Regeneron and Sanofi, which was approved in 2017. There are a number of topical treatments, oral agents, and biologic agents in development for AD. Topical agents may have different indications and limitations of use. Three oral agents have completed Phase 3 trials in AD and include baricitinib by Eli Lilly, abrocitinb by Pfizer, and upadacitinib by AbbVie. Baricitinib, abrocitinib, and upadacitinib are approved in the EU and Japan for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Physicians may also use agents such as tofacitinib off-label in the treatment of AD. There are also biologic agents in development for AD including but not limited to IL-13 inhibitors tralokinumab by Leo Pharma and lebrikizumab by Eli Lilly. In September 2021, the FDA approved topical JAK Opzelura (ruxolitinib) for the short term treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In January 2022, the FDA approved tralokinumab for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients. In January 2022, the FDA approved Rinvoq (upadacitinib) for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in patients 12 years of age and older and also approved Cibinqo (abrocitinib) for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients. This list does not include all topical, oral, or biologic agents in development. 
Etrasimod is currently in Phase 2 programs for the treatment of EoE and AA. If approved for EoE, etrasimod would compete with generic oral steroids, branded oral steroids, generic and branded proton pump inhibitors, and biologics. If approved for AA, etrasimod would compete with generic topical agents, branded topical agents, oral agents, and biologics.
APD418 is in development for AHF. There are currently no approved products to improve outcomes in AHF patients. A number of agents are used off-label, including, inotropic agents, loop diuretics, nitrate vasodilators, PDE3 inhibitors, and calcium sensitizers. Other agents are in development—for example, BMS is developing cimlanod (BMS-986231) in a Phase 2 study and Lee’s Pharma is developing istaroxime, a positive inotropic agent. 
Temanogrel is in development for prevention of MVO in the setting of PCI. A number of drugs are used off-label to manage these patients, including direct thrombin inhibitors, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. There is one agent in Phase 2 development, revacept, by AdvanceCor, with a mechanism of action of platelet membrane glycoprotein VI inhibition. 
Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater drug development capabilities and financial, scientific and marketing resources than we do. Additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated with our competitors. As a result, our competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the research, development, marketing and promotion of therapeutic products or drug discovery techniques, or to adapt more readily to technological advances than we can. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving regulatory approval or commercializing drugs before we do.
We may rely on collaborators for support of development programs and for the manufacturing and marketing of drug candidates. Such collaborators may be conducting multiple drug development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subject of their agreements with us, which may negatively impact the development of drugs that are subject to our agreements. In addition, we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for such collaboration arrangements, and technological and other developments by others may make it more difficult for us to establish such relationships.
Government Regulation
We and our collaborators are subject to significant governmental regulation. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the preclinical and clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, import, export, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, tracking, recordkeeping, advertising, pricing and promotion of drug candidates and commercialized drugs. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements may result in inspectional notices of violation, warning letters, civil or criminal penalties, 
suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of a product from the market or other negative consequences.
In the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, many of which are required to be performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and be updated annually;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, generally accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA to file the NDA for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations;
•FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
•Prior to commercialization, centrally acting drugs may be subject to review and potential scheduling by the DEA.
The development and approval process requires substantial expertise, time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular drug candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The initial IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, following its initial safety review. During the 30-day time period the FDA may require additional information. The FDA may institute a clinical hold at the 30-day time period if any questions are not fully addressed or because of other concerns about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may place an IND on partial or full clinical hold at any time during a product candidate’s development. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
Clinical trials. For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap:
•Phase 1 clinical trials. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, typically in healthy volunteers, but in some cases in patients.
•Phase 2 clinical trials. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific 
targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3 clinical trials. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies or adequate and well-controlled studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers.
•Phase 4 clinical trials. The FDA may approve an NDA for a drug candidate but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved an NDA. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
New drug applications. The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, information. An NDA is usually accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission by the NDA sponsor. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within 10 months from its acceptance of the filing or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from its acceptance of the filing. The review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA by issuing a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Data are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Approval may occur with Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, that may limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarketing programs or other information.
Expedited Development and Review Programs. The FDA has four programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition: fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation. These programs do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
New investigational drugs may qualify for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical need. Fast track designation applies to the drug (either alone or in combination with other drugs) and the specific indication for which it is being studied. A fast track product is afforded opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA to support efficient development and may be eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of NDA submission. After preliminary evaluation of clinical data and a determination that a fast track product may be effective, the FDA may consider reviewing portions of an NDA before the complete application is submitted (“rolling review”), if the sponsor gains FDA agreement on the proposed schedule for submission of the various sections of the NDA and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
An NDA for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products may qualify for priority review designation. A priority review designation means that the FDA’s goal is to take action on the NDA within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months under its standard review.
In addition, a product may qualify for an accelerated approval pathway if it meets three criteria: treats a serious condition; generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies; demonstrates an effect on a surrogate 
endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post marketing clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-market studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs and biologics referred to as “breakthrough therapies”, and a drug candidate may qualify for breakthrough therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. Breakthrough therapy designation affords all of the fast track designation features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. Breakthrough therapy designation is distinct from both the accelerated approval pathway and priority review designation, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met.
Other US regulatory requirements. Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections (which may be unannounced) by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection or after the appropriate FDA office review of the Establishment Inspection Report prepared by the investigator, can list conditions the FDA believes may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter be issued for violations of “regulatory significance,” also known as Official Action Indicated, or OAI. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in regulatory action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and warning letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, recall of product, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for healthcare professional marketing activities and materials, direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the confines of the pivotal studies and the approved label. Further, we may be required to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA for changes to, among other things, the indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities of a drug. Failure to comply with these requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, corrective advertising, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or potential civil and criminal penalties.
Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA, if in their professional medical judgment, the physicians deem such use to be appropriate. Such off-label uses are common across certain medical specialties. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
To distribute products commercially, we or our collaborators, as applicable, must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution.
Drug Enforcement Administration regulation. The DEA regulates drugs that are controlled substances. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of the five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. The CSA governs, among other things, the inventory, distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. Any drug that acts on the central nervous system has the potential to become a controlled substance based on an evaluation of its abuse potential, and scheduling by the DEA is a separate process that may delay the commercial launch of a drug even after FDA approval of the NDA. Companies with a scheduled drug are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEA’s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation or a denial of renewal of any DEA registration, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity. Market exclusivity provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act can delay the submission or approval of applications seeking to rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved NDA. A new chemical entity, or NCE, subject to an NDA is entitled to a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement of patents listed with the FDA by the NDA holder. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active ingredient. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication or the same product for the same indication if demonstrated to be clinically superior. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Pediatric exclusivity. The FDA may issue Written Requests for pediatric studies prior to approval of a new drug application, if the FDA has determined that information related to the use of the drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits. As an incentive to industry to conduct such studies requested by the FDA, a 6-month period of additional exclusivity may be granted as an add-on to existing marketing exclusivity periods and patent terms.
Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing and sale of the product in those jurisdictions. 
Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, must be submitted to the national health authority and an independent ethics committee in each country in which we intend to conduct clinical trials, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which took effect in January 2022, there will be a centralized application procedure in respect of clinical trials to be conducted in the EU where one national authority will take the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have more limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product in the EU, we must submit a marketing authorization application either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures. 
Centralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization, which is issued by the European Commission based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (together, the “EEA”). The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicines that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210-day review period is reduced to 150 days. 
National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU Member States, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
•Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorizations in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU Member State and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
•Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU Member States in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
In the EEA, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity and qualify for data exclusivity.
The EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be 
sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free protocol assistance, fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedures and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval, which can be extended to 12 years if trials are conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon pediatric investigational plan. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Great Britain, or GB, is no longer covered by the EEA’s procedures outlined above (Northern Ireland will be covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). A separate marketing authorization will be required to market drugs in GB. However, for two years from 1 January 2021, the MHRA may adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval of new marketing authorizations through the centralized procedure, and the MHRA will have regard to marketing authorizations approved in a country in the EEA (although in both cases a marketing authorization will only be granted if any GB-specific requirements are met). Various national procedures are now available to place a drug on the market in the UK, GB, or Northern Ireland, with the main national procedure having a maximum timeframe of 150 days (excluding time taken to provide any further information or data required). The data exclusivity periods in the UK are currently in line with those in the EU, but the Trade and Cooperation Agreement agreed between the UK and EU provides that the periods for both data and market exclusivity are to be determined by domestic law, and so there could be divergence in the future.
Orphan designation in GB following Brexit is largely aligned with the position in the EU but is based on the prevalence of the condition in GB. It is therefore possible that conditions that are currently designated as orphan conditions in GB will no longer be and that conditions that are not currently designated as orphan conditions in the EU will be designated as such in GB.
Prescription drug reimbursement and healthcare reform. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of prescription drug products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are less likely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement are important to new product acceptance.
If a drug is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 as well as the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort, which has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and 
we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. Under the Biden administration the Build Back Better plan has attempted to address several of these issues but has been met with resistance in the Senate. According to a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the key elements included in this framework are 1) Allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs covered under Medicare Part B and Part D, 2) Requiring inflation rebates to limit annual increase in drug prices in Medicare and private insurers, 3) Capping out of pocket spending for Medicare Part D enrollees, 4) Limiting cost sharing requirements for insulin for people with Medicare and private insurance, 5) Eliminating cost-sharing for adult vaccines covered under Part D, 6) Repealing the Trump Administration’s proposed drug rebate rule that had already been delayed. Although the bill received support from the House of Representatives, it may lack the support needed to pass in the Senate. The administration is considering breaking up the bill in order to gain Senate support. Additional legislation outside of the Build Back Better plan is being considered to reduce pharmacy fees paid to middlemen payers with the goal of reducing patient out-of-pocket and domestic and international reference pricing will continue to be evaluated, but as with other legislation may face resistance within the Senate. This further highlights potential difficulties to gain unanimous support for pharmaceutical pricing legislation regardless of the administration in charge. 
In addition, there has been heightened scrutiny in the United States and other countries of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. In the United States, such scrutiny has resulted in congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempted to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 due to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation Model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, and other COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare rate reduction sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Congress is considering additional health reform measures.
In countries outside the United States, pricing of pharmaceutical products may be subject to governmental control. Evaluation criteria used by many government agencies for the purposes of pricing and reimbursement typically focus on a product’s degree of innovation and its ability to meet a clinical need unfulfilled by currently available therapies. Some countries operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available 
therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Healthcare fraud and abuse. Pharmaceutical companies are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims laws.
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or provide any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, service or item, including the prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Some of the state prohibitions are broader in scope and apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
In the course of practicing medicine, physicians may legally prescribe FDA-approved drugs for an indication that has not been approved by the FDA and which, therefore, is not described in the product’s approved labeling, so-called “off-label use” or “the practice of medicine,” if deemed appropriate in the physicians’ professional medical judgment. The FDA does not ordinarily regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA and other government agencies do, however, restrict communications on the subject of off-label use by a manufacturer or those acting on behalf of a manufacturer. Companies may not promote FDA-approved drugs for off-label uses. The FDA and other governmental agencies do permit a manufacturer (and those acting on its behalf) to engage in some limited, non-misleading, non-promotional exchanges of scientific information regarding unapproved indications.
There are numerous federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the Federal Civil False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties Law, that forbid, among other things, anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Suits filed under the Federal Civil False Claims Act can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government, known as “qui tam” actions, and such individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The filing of qui tam actions has caused a number of pharmaceutical, medical device, and other healthcare companies to have to defend a Federal Civil False Claims Act action. 
The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Additionally, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
In addition, the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to track and annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, and information regarding certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members. 
We may also be subject to state equivalents of these fraud and abuse laws.

Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by significant criminal, civil and/or administrative sanctions, including individual imprisonment, disgorgement, criminal fines and civil monetary penalties, possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), and integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. In addition, under certain healthcare fraud and abuse laws, there is 
an ability for private individuals to bring similar actions. Additionally, many states have analogous fraud and abuse laws, some of which may be broader in scope. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. The federal transparency requirements under the ACA require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests. Additionally, recent federal legislation imposes additional obligations on certain pharmaceutical manufacturers, among others, regarding drug product tracking and tracing.
Our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We are also subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits companies and individuals from engaging in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
Healthcare and other privacy and security laws. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations regarding the privacy, protection, and security of health information and other personal information. These laws and regulations impose obligations and restrictions on us with respect to the collection, storage, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal information.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities and their business associations and covered subcontractors that perform services for them involving individually identifiable health information. We may be subject to, or our collaborators’ marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA and its implementing regulations. In addition, many state laws apply to the use and disclosure of health and other personal information.
For example, as of January 1, 2020, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA. The CCPA has created new individual privacy rights for California residents and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling the personal information of such residents. Among other obligations, the CCPA requires covered businesses to provide new disclosures to California residents and to respond to requests to access and/or delete personal information. The CCPA also allows for a private right of action for data breaches. 
The European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, imposes many requirements and restrictions that impact our collection, transfer, use and retention of personal data of clinical trial subjects and other individuals in the European Union. For example, the GDPR dictates mandatory contractual terms for service providers that process personal data for us and restricts our ability to transfer data from the European Economic Area to our offices and service providers in the United States and other countries. Penalties for non-compliance with the GDPR are steep, with potential fines of up to 4% of our global revenue.
Because we have operations in Switzerland, we also are required to comply with the data privacy and security laws and regulations of that country. As we conduct clinical trials and other activities that involve the collection of personal data from individuals in other countries and regions, we may be subject to additional data privacy and security laws and regulations.
Across the United States and globally, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security continue to develop and evolve. The data privacy and security laws and regulations to which we are subject will likely impact (possibly significantly) our business activities. Many of the laws and regulations that apply to us contain ambiguous provisions or impose requirements that differ from country to country, creating uncertainty. Compliance with the enhanced obligations imposed by such laws and regulations may require us to revise our business practices, allocate more resources to privacy and security, and implement new technologies. Such efforts may result in significant costs to our business.
Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

Manufacturing, Revenues from External Customers, and Sources and Availability of Materials
We recognized revenues of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our revenues of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily included royalty revenue from Eisai. Our revenues of $806.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 included an $800.0 million upfront payment from United Therapeutics, $5.0 million from Everest, and $1.7 million from Boehringer Ingelheim. This information excludes revenue activity reported within discontinued operations. We do not currently engage in manufacturing activities and we are not dependent on availability of materials for our core business operations. 
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
Our business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. In the United States, we are subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the CSA and other federal, state or local regulations.
We may be subject to further such regulations in the future. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
Human Capital
Arena’s leadership and employees are guided by our purpose – to deliver our important medicines and a simple statement that defines how we approach everything we do: Care More. Act Differently.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 448 full and part-time employees located primarily in our three “hubs” – San Diego, CA, Boston, MA and Zug, Switzerland, as well as home-based employees across the US and Europe. In addition to our employees, we engage consultants, independent contractors, and temporary employees to provide flexibility in support of our business execution and objectives. 
We know our success is anchored in our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled team members. We operate in a very competitive employment landscape and recognize that what differentiates Arena from others is more than fair, equitable and competitive salaries, broad-based equity ownership, high-quality health and well-being programs, significant investments in employee development and safe, healthy and conscious workspaces – these are price of entry. We think what differentiates Arena is that we are guided by both our purpose and through the lens of our values – Put People First, Be Curious, Think Disruptive and Be Daring –- we actively strive to inspire and cultivate a vibrant, thriving and resilient culture that engenders a sense of purpose, community, connection and gratitude. We also encourage a workplace that is diverse and inclusive at all levels and we continue to strengthen our diversity and inclusion initiatives through our IDE@A (Inclusion, Diversity and Equity at Arena) employee advocacy committee that promotes sharing, learning and engagements in diversity, equity, and inclusion topics and activities.
