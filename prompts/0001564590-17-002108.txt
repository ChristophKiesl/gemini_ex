Item 1. | Business
---------+---------

 Sprouts Farmers Market operates as a healthy grocery store that offers fresh, natural and organic food that includes fresh produce, bulk foods, vitamins and supplements, packaged groceries, meat and seafood, deli, baked goods, dairy products, frozen foods, body care and natural household items catering to consumers’ growing interest in health and wellness. Since our founding in 2002, we have grown rapidly, significantly increasing our sales, store count and profitability. With 256 stores in 14 states as of February 23, 2017, we are one of the largest healthy grocery stores selling fresh, natural and organic food in the United States. 
 At Sprouts, we believe healthy living is a journey and every meal is a choice. The cornerstones of our business are fresh, natural and organic products at compelling prices (which we refer to as “Healthy Living for Less”), an attractive, convenient and differentiated shopping experience featuring a broad selection of innovative healthy products, and knowledgeable team members who we believe provide best-in-class customer engagement and product education. 
 Healthy Living for Less. Consistent with our farmers market heritage, our offering begins with fresh produce, which we source, warehouse and distribute in-house and sell at prices we believe to be significantly below those of other food retailers. In addition, our scale, operating structure and deep industry relationships position us to consistently deliver competitive prices and promote value throughout the store. Based on our experience, we believe we attract a broad customer base, including conventional supermarket customers, and appeal to a much wider demographic than specialty retailers of natural and organic food. We believe that over time, our compelling prices and product offering convert many “trial” customers into loyal “lifestyle” customers who shop Sprouts with greater frequency and across an increasing number of departments. 
 Attractive, Differentiated Shopping Experience. In a convenient, small-box format (average store size of 28,000 to 30,000 sq. ft.), our stores have a farmers market feel, with a bright, open-air atmosphere to create a comfortable and engaging in-store experience. We strive to be our customers’ everyday healthy grocery store. We feature fresh produce and bulk foods at the center of the store surrounded by a complete grocery offering. Consistent with our fresh, natural and organic offering, we choose not to carry most of the traditional, national branded consumer packaged goods generally found at conventional grocery retailers. Instead, we offer a full shopping experience featuring high-quality and innovative healthier alternatives that emphasize our focus on fresh, natural and organic products at great values. 
 Customer Engagement and Education. Our commitment to “Healthy Living for Less” is shared by our more than 24,000 team members throughout the entire organization who are dedicated to our passion for educating and engaging with our customers with the goal of making healthy eating easier and more accessible. We believe our well-trained and engaged team members, as well as the materials we disseminate through our digital and social media platforms, help our customers increasingly understand that they can purchase a wide selection of high-quality, healthy, and great tasting food for themselves and their families at attractive prices by shopping at Sprouts. 
Our Heritage 
 In 2002, we opened the first Sprouts Farmers Market store in Chandler, Arizona. From our founding in 2002 through January 1, 2017, we continued to open new stores while successfully rebranding 43 Henry’s Farmers Market (referred to as “Henry’s”) and 39 Sunflower Farmers Market (referred to as “Sunflower”) stores added through acquisitions to the Sprouts banner. These three businesses all trace their lineage back to Henry’s Farmers Market and were built with similar store formats and operations including a strong emphasis on value, produce and service in smaller, convenient locations. The consistency of these formats and operations was an important factor that allowed us to rapidly and

successfully rebrand and integrate each of these businesses under the Sprouts banner and on a common platform. 
 On August 1, 2013, our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and on August 6, 2013, we closed our initial public offering (referred to as our “IPO”). 
 Our Stores and Operations 
 We believe our stores represent a blend of conventional supermarkets, farmers markets, natural foods stores, and smaller specialty markets, differentiating us from other food retailers, while also providing a complete offering for our customers. 

• | Store Design. Our stores are organized in a “flipped” conventional food retail store model, positioning our produce at the center of the store surrounded by a complete grocery offering. We typically dedicate approximately 15% of a store’s selling square footage to produce, which we believe is significantly higher than many of our peers. The stores are designed with open floor plans and low displays, intended to provide an easy-to-shop environment that allows our customers to view the entire store, and our small box format allows for quick in-and-out service. The below diagram shows a sample layout of our stores:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer Engagement. We are committed to providing, and believe we have, best-in-class customer engagement, which builds trust with our customers and differentiates the Sprouts shopping experience from that of many of our competitors. We design our stores to maximize customers’ interactions with our team members, as we believe this interaction provides an opportunity to educate customers and provides a valued, differentiated customer service model, which enhances customer loyalty and increases visits and purchases over time.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Store Size. Our stores are generally between 28,000 and 30,000 square feet, which we believe is smaller than many of our peers’ average stores. Our stores are located in a variety of mid-sized and larger shopping centers, lifestyle centers and in certain cases, independent single-unit, stand-alone developments. The size of our stores and our real estate strategy provide us flexibility in site selection, including entering into new developments or existing sites formerly operated by other retailers, including other grocery banners, office supply stores, electronics retailers and other second generation space. Further, we believe our value positioning allows us to serve a diverse customer base and provides us significant flexibility to
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

enter new markets across a variety of socio-economic areas, including markets with varying levels of fresh, natural and organic grocer penetration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Team Members. Our stores are typically staffed with 80 to 90 full and part-time team members including a store manager, an assistant store manager, eight department managers, five assistant department managers, store office staff and other team members. We strive to create a strong and unified company culture and develop team members throughout the entire organization, and we assist our store teams with our store support office and regional teams. We have prioritized making investments in training that we believe enhances our team members’ knowledge, particularly with respect to our expanded and evolving product offerings, so our team members can continue to engage and assist our customers. We believe our team members contribute to our consistently high service standards and that this helps us successfully open and operate our stores.

Our Product Offering 
 We are a complete food retailer that offer a full shopping experience for our customers. We focus and tailor our assortment to fresh, natural and organic foods and healthier options throughout all of our departments. 
Fresh, Natural and Organic Foods 
 Our product offerings focus on fresh, natural and organic foods. Foods are generally considered “fresh” if they are minimally processed or in its raw state not subject to any type of preservation or freezing. Natural foods can be broadly defined as foods that are minimally processed and are free of synthetic preservatives, artificial sweeteners, colors, flavors and other additives, growth hormones, antibiotics, hydrogenated oils, stabilizers and emulsifiers. Essentially, natural foods are largely or completely free of non-naturally occurring chemicals and are as near to their whole, natural state as possible. 
 Organic foods refer to the food itself as well as the method by which it is produced. In general, organic operations must demonstrate that they are protecting natural resources, conserving biodiversity, and using only approved substances and must be certified by a USDA-accredited certifying agency. These organic standards include: 
  
• | Crop production must not use irradiation, sewage sludge, synthetic fertilizers, prohibited pesticides, and genetically modified organisms.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Livestock producers must meet animal health and welfare standards, not use antibiotics or growth hormones, use 100% organic feed, and provide animals with access to the outdoors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multi-ingredient organic food must be comprised of 95% or more certified organic content.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, retailers that handle, store or sell organic products must implement measures to protect their organic character.

Products 
 We categorize the varieties of products we sell as perishable and non-perishable. Perishable product categories include produce, meat, seafood, deli and bakery. Non-perishable product categories include grocery, vitamins and supplements, bulk items, dairy and dairy alternatives, frozen foods, beer and wine, and natural health and body care. The following is a breakdown of our perishable and non-perishable sales mix: 

 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014
----------------+------+------+---+------+------+-----
Perishables | | 50.4 | % | | 50.8 | % | 50.8 | %
Non-Perishables | | 49.6 | % | | 49.2 | % | 49.2 | %

Departments 
 While we focus on providing an abundant and affordable offering of natural and organic produce, our stores also include the following departments that enable customers to have a full grocery shopping experience: packaged groceries, meat and seafood, deli, vitamins and supplements, dairy and dairy alternatives, bulk items, baked goods, frozen foods, natural health and body care, and beer and wine. We believe each of our departments provides high-quality, value-oriented offerings for our customers which we continuously refine with our customer preferences in mind, including our ongoing fresh food and deli expansion initiatives in select stores, comprised of freshly prepared proteins and sides, full service deli case, salad bar, fresh juices and soup station to provide more convenient prepared food options for our customers.
Private Label 
 We have been expanding the breadth of our Sprouts branded products over the last several years and have a dedicated product development team focused on continuing this growth. These products feature competitively priced specialty and innovative products, with great taste profiles and quality and strict ingredient standards that we believe equal or exceed national brands. Our private label program now accounts for over 10% of our revenue and features over 2,150 products. Our private label brands drive value by offering our customers lower prices while still delivering generally higher margin as compared to branded products. We believe our private label products build and enhance the Sprouts brand and allow us to distinguish ourselves from our competitors, promoting customer loyalty and creating a destination shopping experience. 
Sourcing and Distribution 
 We manage the buying of, and set the standards for, the products we sell, and we source our products from over 800 vendors and suppliers, both domestically and internationally. 
 We believe, based on our industry experience, that our strong relationships in the produce business provide us a competitive advantage and enable us to offer high-quality produce at prices we believe are significantly below those of conventional food retailers and even further below high-end natural and organic food retailers. Given the importance of produce to our stores, we source, warehouse and distribute all produce in-house. This ensures our produce meets our high quality standards. We are supported by dedicated regional procurement teams that provide us flexibility to procure produce on local, regional and national levels. 
 We have department and product specifications that ensure a consistently high level of quality across product ingredients, production standards and other key measures of freshness, natural and organic standards. These specifications are measured at both entry and exit points to our facilities. We distribute all produce to our stores from two leased distribution facilities and two third-party operated distribution facilities, and we manage every aspect of quality control in this department. We believe we

currently have sufficient capacity at these facilities to support our near-term growth plans in our current markets, but we continue to explore expansion opportunities as our needs evolve. 
 We believe our scale, together with this decentralized purchasing structure and flexibility generates cost savings, which we then pass on to our customers. Distributors and farmers recognize the volume of goods we sell through our stores and our flexible purchasing and distribution model allows us to opportunistically acquire produce at great value which we will also pass along to our customers. 
 For all non-produce products, we use third-party distributors and vendors to distribute products directly to our stores following specifications and quality control standards that are set by us. 
 KeHE Distributors, LLC (referred to as “KeHE”), is our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products, accounting for approximately 33%, 31% and 31% of our total purchases in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Another 4% of our total purchases in each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were made through our secondary supplier, United Natural Foods, Inc. (referred to as “UNFI”). See “Risk Factors—Disruption of significant supplier relationships could negatively affect our business.” 
 Our Pricing, Marketing and Advertising 
 Pricing
 We are committed to a pricing strategy consistent with our motto of “Healthy Living for Less.” As a farmers market style store, we emphasize low prices throughout the entire store, as we are able to pass along the benefits of our scale and purchasing power to our customers. We position our prices with everyday value for our customers with regular promotions on selected products that drive traffic and trial. We typically have about 40% of our approximately 18,900 products on sale at any given time. 
Marketing and Advertising
 We supplement and support our everyday competitive pricing strategy through weekly advertised specials, a weekly e-circular, online coupons and special promotions. We send over 16 million weekly advertisement circulars to encourage customers to shop at our stores. These circulars focus on product education and offerings and aim to engage the customer. We use sales flyers distributed through direct delivery or inserted into local newspapers as our primary medium for advertising. These sales flyers include representative products from our key departments. In addition, we have a customer database of over one million customers as of January 1, 2017, many of whom receive electronic versions of our weekly circulars or monthly newsletters. 
 We tailor our advertisements to specific markets, which provides us with greater flexibility to offer different promotions and respond to local competitive activity. In addition, we advertise our sales promotions and support our brand image through the use of local radio and billboards, as well as targeted direct mail in specific markets. 
 We also continue to promote and enhance our digital presence.  We developed and maintain a smartphone app on which we include mobile coupon clip, customized offers based on the user’s preferences and in-store scan features, and our website, www.sprouts.com, on which we display our weekly sales flyers and offer special deals. Our website also features on-line ordering for holiday meals and catering trays. The inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include or incorporate by reference the information on or accessible through our website herein. We continue to expand our social media platform. As of January 1, 2017, we had approximately 1.4 million Facebook fans. In addition, we have partnered with Amazon Prime to offer 1-hour or 2-hour deliveries from our stores in selected markets. We will continue to explore online ordering opportunities to further connect with our customers.

In addition to the weekly circulars, we offer numerous other saving opportunities for our customers, all of which are meant to reinforce our value offering and are designed to appeal to specific target customers. In 2016, we had approximately 34 department-wide promotions at each store throughout the year, which included our Vitamin Extravaganza, Frozen Frenzy, Gluten-Free Favorites, and Incredible Bulk Sales, in addition to our routine Double-Ad Wednesday promotion and 72-Hour Sales. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is subject to modest seasonality. Our average weekly sales per store fluctuate throughout the year and are typically highest in the first half of the fiscal year and lowest during the fourth quarter. Produce, which contributed approximately 24% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2017, is generally more available in the first six months of our fiscal year due to the timing of peak growing seasons. 
Our Customers 
 Our target customer seeks a wide assortment of high-quality fresh and nutritious food as well as vitamins and supplements at competitive prices. We believe our value proposition and complete grocery offering engages both conventional and health-focused shoppers. 
 We have a broad range of customers from those looking for value, to customers seeking specific attribute products, to those seeking to eat healthier. We believe the majority of our customers are initially attracted to our stores by our fresh produce, which we offer at prices we believe are significantly below those of conventional food retailers and even further below high-end natural and organic food retailers. We drive customer traffic by aggressively promoting produce and other items through weekly advertisements designed primarily to reach the everyday supermarket shopper. These customers include “trial” customers that limit their shopping to specific products or departments, such as produce. Through department-specific promotions, in-store signage, and customer education, many customers become “transition” customers that shop new departments and try new products. Over time, through customer service and engagement, targeted marketing, and increased knowledge of our product offering, we believe that transition customers become “lifestyle” customers that shop with greater frequency throughout the entire store.
 Responsible Retailing
 We are committed to operating our business in a way that respects social and environmental well-being. We call this commitment “responsible retailing,” and we believe we have a unique opportunity to positively impact the communities in which we operate. 
Sprouts Sustainable Practices
 Our commitment to our communities extends to operating our business in a way that minimizes our impact on the environment and safeguards the health of our communities.  As we grow, we are able to achieve greater scale in the impact of our sustainability initiatives. Through our Food Rescue Program in 2016, we were able to divert 30 million pounds of food from landfills, including 18 million pounds of food donated to local hunger relief agencies and food banks and 12 million pounds of food waste sent to local farms and composting facilities.  Our annual Grab’N’Give campaign funded by contributions from our customers generated over 263,000 personal care and emergency food bags for those in need. In 2016, we were named as a “Leadership Partner” by Feeding America for our continued support to eliminating hunger in the United States.

Sustainability at Sprouts also encompasses other facets of our operations, including the construction of our stores.  In 2016, we received more “GreenChill” store certifications than any other grocery retailer.  The GreenChill program is a partnership between the Environmental Protection Agency and food retailers to reduce refrigerant emissions and decrease their impact on the ozone layer and climate change. Our environmental stewardship is also reflected in our rigorous recycling program; during 2016, we recycled 70 million pounds of cardboard and 0.5 million pounds of plastics. We believe our sustainable practices strengthen our relationship with customers in the communities we serve.  
The Sprouts Healthy Communities Foundation
 In 2015, we formed the Sprouts Healthy Communities Foundation (referred to as our “Foundation”), a registered 501(c)(3) organization focused on giving locally in the areas of health education and nutrition, food security and hunger relief and helping people living with disabilities and health concerns. Our Foundation relies on donations from Sprouts, as well as our vendors and customers, to support non-profit organizations that are stewards of health and wellness in the communities where our team members and customers work, live and play. 
 Our Foundation has multi-year partnerships with three organizations that are committed to making a meaningful difference in the lives of children, individuals and families. REAL School Gardens builds learning gardens in low-income elementary schools that enhance student learning and provide health nutrition education. Vitamin Angels provides access to life saving vitamins and minerals for at-risk populations in need, particularly pregnant women, new mothers and children. Autism Speaks provides resources for adults and children affected by autism. Collectively, our Foundation donated over $1.2 million to these three organizations in 2016.  
 In 2016, our Foundation began the Neighborhood Grants program to distribute donations received from Sprouts and our customers entirely in the communities in which the donations were collected. With grants ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, our Foundation contributed over $400,000 to local non-profit organizations aligned with its goal to create stronger and healthier communities. Our stores and engaged team members also contribute to healthy environments through in-kind support and volunteerism at community events.  
 Growing Our Business
 We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on two powerful, long-term consumer trends—a growing interest in health and wellness and a focus on value and are pursuing a number of strategies designed to continue our growth and strong financial performance, including: 
 Expand our store base. We intend to continue expanding our store base by pursuing new store openings in existing markets, expanding into adjacent markets and penetrating new markets. We have opened 24, 27 and 36 new stores in fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  We expect to continue to expand our store base with 32 store openings planned in fiscal 2017, including our initial expansion into Florida and North Carolina, of which three new stores have opened as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We intend to open approximately 30 new stores annually over the near term, with approximately 60-65% in existing markets.

The below diagram shows our store footprint, by state, as of January 1, 2017. 
 

Continue positive comparable store sales. For 39 consecutive quarters, including throughout the economic downturn from 2008 to 2010, stores under our management have achieved positive comparable store sales growth. We believe the consistency of our performance over time and across geographies and vintages is the result of a number of factors, including our distinctive value positioning and merchandising strategies, product innovation and a well-trained staff focused on customer education and engagement. We believe we can continue to grow the number and size of customer transactions by enhancing our core value proposition and distinctive customer-oriented shopping experience. We aim to grow our average ticket by continuing to expand and refine our fresh, natural and organic product offering, our private label program, our targeted and personalized marketing efforts and our in-store and digital education. We believe these factors, combined with the continued strong growth in fresh, natural and organic food consumption, will allow Sprouts to gain new customers, increase customer loyalty and, over time, convert single-department trial customers into core, lifestyle customers who shop Sprouts with greater frequency and across an increasing number of departments. 
 Grow the Sprouts Farmers Market brand. We are committed to supporting our stores, product offerings and brand through a variety of marketing programs, expanded private label offerings and corporate partnerships. In addition, we will continue our community outreach and charity programs to more broadly connect with our local communities with the aim of promoting our brand and educating consumers on healthy choices. We will also continue to expand our innovative marketing and promotional strategy through print, digital and social media platforms. 
 Train Future Leaders. We believe Sprouts is an attractive place to work with significant growth opportunities for our more than 24,000 team members. In 2016, we promoted approximately 3,500 team members. We regularly assess prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate and offer competitive wages and benefits as we believe active, educated and passionate team members contribute to consumer satisfaction. Customer engagement is critical to our culture and growth plans, and we place great importance on recruiting candidates that share our passion for Healthy Living for Less and training our team members on customer engagement and product knowledge to ensure there is friendly, knowledgeable staff in every department in every store. Our team members are trained and empowered to proactively engage with customers throughout the entire store. This includes investing time to educate 
 
8


them on the benefits of different vitamins, sharing ways to prepare a meal or cutting a piece of produce or opening a package to offer customers product tastings throughout the store. We consider customer education and engagement to be particularly important as many conventional supermarket customers that have not shopped our stores believe that eating healthy is expensive and difficult.
New Store Development 
 We have an extensive and selective process for new store site selection, which includes in-depth analysis of area demographics, competition, growth potential, traffic patterns, grocery spend and other key criteria. We have a dedicated real estate team as well as a real estate committee that includes certain of our executive officers. Multiple members of this committee will conduct an on-site inspection prior to approving any new location. 
 We believe that our store model, combined with our rigorous store selection process and a growing interest in health and wellness, contribute to our attractive new store returns on investment and strong cash flows. We have been successful across varying geographies which we believe supports the portability of the Sprouts brand and store model into a wide range of markets. Based on our experience, we believe that our broad product offering and value proposition appeals to a wider demographic than other leading competitors, including higher-priced health food and gourmet food retailers. Sprouts has been successful across a variety of urban, suburban and rural locations in diverse geographies, from coast to coast, underscoring the heightened interest in eating healthy across markets. 
 We currently anticipate opening approximately 30 new Sprouts Farmers Market stores per year going forward based on our new store site selection analysis. We expect to open approximately two-thirds of our new stores in existing markets and approximately one-third in new markets, as we believe this provides for a good balance, given that our new stores in existing markets mature more quickly than those in new markets.  This mix allows us to focus our resources on developing our new markets so they begin with a solid foundation.
 See “Properties” for additional information with respect to our store locations. 
 Our Competition and Industry
 We operate within the intensely competitive and highly fragmented grocery store industry which encompasses a wide array of food retailers, including large conventional independent and chain supermarkets, warehouse clubs, small grocery and convenience stores, and natural and organic, specialty, mass, discount and other food retail formats. According to the Progressive Grocer, U.S. supermarket sales totaled over $649 billion in 2015. Based on our industry experience, we believe we are capturing significant market share from conventional supermarkets and specialty concepts in this supermarket segment. 
 While the natural and organic food segment is one of the fastest growing segments in the industry, conventional supermarkets have experienced overall share decline from approximately 73% in 2005 to approximately 65% in 2015, according to the Progressive Grocer, as customers have migrated to other grocery retail formats. Conventional supermarket customers are attracted to unique product offerings, formats and differentiated shopping experiences. Based on our industry experience, we also believe consumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness and are actively seeking healthy foods in order to improve eating habits. This overall demand for healthy products is driven by many factors, including increased awareness about the benefits of eating healthy, a greater focus on preventative health measures, and the rising costs of health care. We believe customers are attracted to retailers with comprehensive health and wellness product offerings. As a result, food retailers are offering an increased assortment of fresh, natural and organic foods as well as vitamins and supplements to meet this demand.
 
9


Our competitors include conventional supermarkets such as Kroger and Safeway, as well as other food retailers such as Whole Foods, Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage and Trader Joe’s. We believe Sprouts offers consumers a compelling value relative to conventional supermarkets and mass retailers and will continue to benefit from increasing consumer focus on health, wellness and value, as well as their emphasis on an enhanced shopping experience featuring a broad selection of products along with exceptional customer engagement. 
 Insurance and Risk Management 
 We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers’ compensation, general liability, product liability, director and officers’ liability, team member healthcare benefits, and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage. 
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 
 We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered SPROUTS FARMERS MARKET®, SPROUTS® and HEALTHY LIVING FOR LESS!® trademarks, are valuable assets that we believe reinforce our customers’ favorable perception of our stores. In addition to our trademarks, we believe that our trade dress, which includes the human-scale design, arrangement, color scheme and other physical characteristics of our stores and product displays, is a large part of the farmers market atmosphere we create in our stores and enables customers to distinguish our stores and products from those of our competitors. 
 From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. The outcomes of these actions have included both negotiated out-of-court settlements as well as litigation. 
 Information Technology Systems 
 We have made significant investments in information technology infrastructure, including purchasing, receiving, inventory, point of sale, warehousing, distribution, accounting, reporting and financial systems. Our recent investments have focused on solutions to enhance our team members’ productivity, including business intelligence, labor management and human resources information systems.  We also maintain modern supply chain systems allowing for operating efficiencies and scalability to support our continued growth. All of our stores operate under one integrated information technology platform. We are making investments to our current information technology infrastructure and plan on continuing to invest in this area to support our growth with systems that scale with and add efficiencies to our growing operations.  
Regulatory Compliance 
 Our stores are subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation 
 
10


standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages, environmental protection, licensing for the sale of food and, in many stores, licensing for beer and wine or other alcoholic beverages. Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (referred to as the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (referred to as the “FTC”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (referred to as the “USDA”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 Food. The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of food and food ingredients (other than meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products), as well as dietary supplements. Food additives and food contact substances are subject to pre-market approvals or notification requirements. The FDA’s overall food safety authority was dramatically enhanced in 2011 with the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act (referred to as “FSMA”). Implementing regulations, which began to go into effect in 2016, require food processors and handlers to design and implement effective measures to ensure food safety. Additionally, FSMA increases the FDA’s authority to institute administrative detentions of adulterated and misbranded foods. FSMA also requires enhanced tracking and tracing of food products and, as a result, imposes new recordkeeping burdens upon our suppliers and contract manufacturers. 
 The FDA also exercises broad jurisdiction over the labeling and promotion of food. Labeling is a broad concept that, under certain circumstances, extends even to product-related claims and representations made on a company’s website or similar printed or graphic medium. All foods, including dietary supplements, must bear labeling that provides consumers with essential information with respect to ingredients, product weight, etc. The FDA administers a systematic review and approval program for certain “health claims” (claims describing the relationship between a food substance and a health or disease condition). It has also promulgated regulatory definitions for various “nutrient content claims” (e.g., “high in antioxidants,” “low in fat,” etc.). Additional in-store labeling requirements, requiring disclosure of calories and other nutrient information for frequently sold items, are scheduled to go into effect in 2017. In addition the USDA has been directed, through legislation passed in 2016, to promulgate regulations within two years requiring the disclosure of the presence of genetically modified ingredients in food.
 FDA and USDA Enforcement. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (referred to as “FDCA”) applicable to the safety, labeling, manufacturing and promotion of foods and dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, institute an administrative detention of food, request or order a recall of illegal products from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in the U.S. courts. Similarly, the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service is the public health agency responsible for ensuring that the nation’s commercial supply of meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products is safe, wholesome and correctly labeled and packaged. 
 Dietary Supplements. The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, in particular by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (referred to as “DSHEA”). DSHEA established a framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements, defined “dietary supplement” and “new dietary ingredient” and established new statutory criteria for evaluating the safety of substances meeting the respective definitions. In the process, DSHEA removed dietary supplements and new dietary ingredients from pre-market approval requirements that apply to food additives and pharmaceuticals and established a combination of “notification” and “post marketing controls” for regulating product safety, however, non-dietary ingredients in a dietary supplement remain subject to the FDA’s food additive authorities. DSHEA also empowered the FDA to establish binding good manufacturing practice regulations governing key aspects of the production of dietary supplements.

 Compliance. As is common in our industry, we rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, we seek certifications of compliance, representations and warranties, indemnification and/or insurance from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in products we sell. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from our stores. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and contract manufacturers have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products and we have revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program.
