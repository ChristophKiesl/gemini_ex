Item 1.       Business.     Our Company
 ﻿
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the "Company," "Crimson," "we," "our" or "us" as used herein refer to Crimson Wine Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. Crimson has been conducting business since 1991. Prior to February 25, 2013, Crimson was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leucadia National Corporation (“Leucadia”). On February 1, 2013, Leucadia declared a pro rata dividend of all of the outstanding shares of Crimson’s common stock in a manner that was structured to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the “Distribution”). Leucadia’s common shareholders received one share of Crimson common stock for every ten common shares of Leucadia, with cash in lieu of fractional shares, on February 25, 2013. 
 ﻿
 Crimson is in the business of producing and selling ultra-premium plus wines (i.e., wines that retail for over $15 per 750ml bottle). Crimson is headquartered in Napa, California and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries owns six wineries: Pine Ridge Vineyards, Archery Summit, Chamisal Vineyards, Seghesio Family Vineyards, Double Canyon and Seven Hills Winery. 
 ﻿
 The wine Crimson makes comes from estate grown grapes as well as grapes and bulk wine purchased under contract and on the spot-market. Our business model is a combination of direct to consumer sales and wholesale distributor sales. References to cases of wine herein refer to nine-liter equivalent cases.    ﻿
 Mission and Strategy
 ﻿
 Our mission is as follows:
 ﻿
 As owners of exceptional vineyards in premier growing regions, we are committed to crafting benchmark wines for the pleasure and benefit of those we serve.
 ﻿
 Our strategy is built on three pillars: Quality, Focus and Growth. 
 ﻿
 Quality. We own some of the highest quality vineyards in the U.S. We farm our vineyards in a thoughtful, sustainable way with the goal of producing the highest quality grapes and the highest quality wines possible. As part of executing this strategy, Crimson currently owns or leases approximately 991 plantable acres of vineyard land in California, Oregon and Washington. The Company continues to assess other opportunities to enhance the quality of our vineyard holdings and wine portfolio.
 ﻿
 Focus. We currently own six complementary estate-based winegrowing operations, with each having a unique varietal focus best suited to its specific appellation and region. We have a group of accomplished winegrowing teams who are each responsible for crafting benchmark wines from their respective premier wine growing regions. Many of Crimson’s brands are issued ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations and we believe our scores are a reflection of our focus on what we do best.
 ﻿
 Growth. To support our quality and focus goals, all of our teams, including winegrowing, sales, marketing and administrative are driven towards continuous improvement. The direct to consumer business, which continued to grow in 2016, generates higher gross margins and we intend to continue emphasizing opportunities in this distribution channel in order to further our growth. Our wholesale distribution channel also continued to grow in 2016. Our wines are available in all states domestically through our network of over 50 distributors, and our export team served customers in over 30 countries through independent importers and brokers during 2016.
 ﻿
 Recent Developments
 ﻿
 In December of 2016, we acquired a strategic portion of the Seven Hills Vineyard. This land purchase encompasses approximately 109 plantable acres, primarily in the Walla Walla Valley appellation, including 21 acres of Seven Hills Vineyard old blocks. The

original blocks, which are still in production, were planted in 1980 by the previous owners of our recently acquired Seven Hills Winery. This acquisition was a unique opportunity for Crimson to reconnect this land to Seven Hills Winery. In addition, this acquisition included 14 acres in the Rocks District, a region well recognized for world class Rhone wines.

 ﻿
 Double Canyon Vineyards
 ﻿
 Double Canyon Vineyards acquired land in 2005 and 2006 in the Horse Heaven Hills appellation in Washington. Starting with the 2010 vintage, Double Canyon Vineyards produced and bottled its first wine under the Double Canyon brand name. Since the launch of the Double Canyon brand name, Double Canyon Vineyards has developed a growth plan and significantly expanded production. Starting with the 2015 harvest, the majority of the grapes from the Double Canyon Vineyards were used for Double Canyon’s own brand. In 2016 all of Double Canyon Vineyard’s production was performed in third-party custom crush facilities. Contracted capacity at Double Canyon Vineyards is up to approximately 25,000 cases for the 2016 harvest year.
 ﻿

 ﻿
 Seven Hills Winery
 ﻿
 Seven Hills Winery was acquired in January 2016 and has been conducting operations since 1988.

These vines are some of the oldest commercial plantings of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in the appellation.    ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The markets for ultra-premium plus products in the wine industry are intensely competitive. Crimson’s wines compete domestically and internationally with premium or higher quality wines produced in Europe, South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the United States. Crimson competes on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution capability, and the ultimate consumer has many choices of products from both domestic and international producers. A result of the intense competition has been, and may continue to be, upward pressure on Crimson’s selling and promotional expenses. Many of Crimson’s competitors are significantly larger with greater financial, production, distribution and marketing resources. The U.S. is dominated by three large wineries with production largely based in California, representing approximately 50% of the domestic U.S. case sales volume. Further, Crimson’s wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.

Demand for ultra-premium plus wines can rise and fall with general economic conditions, and is also significantly affected by grape supply. Based on industry wide volume increases in these wine categories, Crimson believes more people are drinking wine than in the past. Crimson’s wines are typically sold at retail price points from $15 to $250 per bottle, however, in the wholesale channel, which represented 88% of Crimson’s case volume in the year ended December 31, 2016, and 89% for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the majority of volume is in the $15 to $30 retail price range.
 ﻿
 Business Segments
 ﻿
 Crimson reports operating results in two segments: Wholesale and Direct to Consumer. These business segments reflect how the Company’s operations are evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial reporting. Both financial and certain nonfinancial data are reported and evaluated to assist senior management with strategic planning. The Company evaluates performance based on the gross profit of the respective business segments. Selling expenses that can be directly attributable to the segment are included, however, centralized selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are not allocated between operating segments. Therefore, net income information for the respective segments is not available. Based on the nature of the Company’s business, revenue generating assets are utilized across segments. Therefore, discrete financial information related to segment assets and other balance sheet data is not available and that information continues to be aggregated. Further information about segments, including sales, cost of sales, gross margin, directly attributable selling expenses, and contribution margin of the segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, can be found in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Sales and Marketing
 ﻿
 Crimson focuses on brand development and distribution to increase revenues and profitability, which has included acquisitions of vineyards and wineries and the development of new brands with existing assets and the development of new direct sales outlets.
 ﻿
 Crimson’s sales and marketing team coordinates the sales and distribution of its various brands, maintains domestic and export distributor relationships and oversees the timing and allocation of new releases. The sales team has employees in major markets in the U.S. and internationally and, where required, as brokers in certain markets. Crimson’s wines are available through many principal retail channels for premium table wines, including fine wine restaurants, hotels, specialty shops, supermarkets and club stores, in all states domestically, as well as cruise lines and over 30 countries throughout the world.
 ﻿
 Crimson believes that the quality and locations of its wineries and tasting facilities help to create demand for its brands at the consumer level, which positively impacts sales to distributors as well. Crimson participates in many wine tasting and other promotional events throughout the country in order to increase awareness and demand for its products. Many of Crimson’s brands are issued ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations, and higher scores will usually translate into greater demand and higher pricing.
 ﻿
 Wholesale
 ﻿
 Crimson’s wines are primarily sold to distributors, who then sell to retailers and restaurants. Domestic sales of Crimson’s wines are made through over 50 independent wine and spirits distributors. International sales are made through independent importers and brokers. During 2016, domestic distributor sales represented 52% of net sales and export sales represented 6% of net sales. During 2016, one distributor represented 12% of Crimson’s net sales and no other single distributor represented 10% or more of net sales.
 ﻿
 Direct to Consumer
 ﻿
 As permitted under federal and local regulations, Crimson has been placing increasing emphasis on direct sales to consumers, which it is able to do through the Internet, wine clubs, and at the wineries’ tasting rooms. During 2016, direct sales to consumers represented 36% of net sales. Approximately 60% of the direct to consumer net sales were through wine clubs, 25% were through the wineries’ tasting rooms and the balance from e-commerce, special events and reimbursement for freight expense. Members typically join our wine clubs after visiting our tasting rooms at our various facilities, or after hearing about our wine clubs from other members. Our tasting rooms are located in vacation areas that typically attract consumers interested in winemaking and touring the area. Direct sales to consumers are more profitable for Crimson as it is able to sell its products at a price closer to retail prices rather than the wholesale price received from distributors, however, for certain direct sales offers, some of the profit is offset by freight subsidies.
 ﻿
 Grape Supply
 ﻿
 Crimson controls approximately 991 acres of vineyards in the Napa Valley, Sonoma County and Edna Valley in California, the Willamette Valley in Oregon, the Horse Heaven Hills in Washington and the Walla Walla Valley across Washington and Oregon; approximately 846 acres of these vineyards are planted, with the majority of the unplanted acres in Washington. Crimson expects to continue vineyard development plans for non-producing acreage in California and Oregon properties and additional new acres were planted in 2016 in Washington. Newly planted vines take approximately three to five years to reach maturity and vineyards can be expected to have a useful life of at least 25 years before replanting is necessary. Depending on the site, soil and water conditions and

spacing, Crimson’s experience has been that it costs approximately $20,000 to $75,000 per acre over a three year period to develop open land into a producing premium wine grape vineyard, before taking into account the cost of the land. During 2016 the average cost per acre placed into service was approximately $50,000 per acre.
 ﻿
 In 2016, approximately 28% of Crimson’s total grape supply came from Crimson controlled vineyards. Crimson purchases the balance of its supply from approximately 108 independent growers. The grower contracts range from one-year spot market purchases to intermediate and long term-agreements. During 2016, no single grower represented 10% or more of Crimson’s grape supply.
 ﻿
 Winemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of grapes available to Crimson thereby materially and adversely affecting the supply of Crimson’s products and its profitability.
 ﻿
 The table below summarizes Crimson’s wine grape supply and production from the last three harvests:
 ﻿
 ﻿

﻿ | | | 
-----------------------------------------------------+--------------+---------+--------
﻿ | Harvest Year

 The table below summarizes Crimson’s sales of grapes and bulk wine during the last three years:
 ﻿
 ﻿

﻿ | | | 
-------------------------------------+-------------------------+---------+-------
﻿ | Year Ended December 31,
﻿ | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 
Grapes sold (in tons) | 861 | 370 | 319 
Bulk wine sold (in gallons) | 194,140 | 145,543 | 85,876
Total grape and bulk wine cases sold | 142,000 | 86,000 | 58,000
﻿ | | | 

  ﻿
 Total cases shipped were approximately 364,000, 355,000 and 321,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cases shipped are disclosed for informational purposes, but do not necessarily correspond to the vintage year the grapes are grown and crushed. Depending on the wine, the production cycle to bottled sales is anywhere from one to three years. 
 ﻿
 Winemaking
 ﻿
 Crimson’s winemaking philosophy includes the use of the latest industry winemaking advances to complement making wine in the traditional manner by starting with high quality fruit and handling it as gently and naturally as possible all the way to the bottle. Each of Crimson’s wineries is equipped with modern crush, fermentation and storage equipment as well as technology that is focused on producing the highest quality wines for each of the varietals it produces.
 ﻿
 Government Regulation
 ﻿
 Wine production and sales are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Department of Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), the California Department of Alcohol Beverage Control (“CABC”) and other state and federal governmental authorities that regulate interstate sales, licensing, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising and other activities. In addition, federal and state authorities require warning labels on beverages for sale or distribution in the United States containing 0.5% of alcohol by volume or higher. Restrictions or taxes imposed by government authorities on the sale of wine could increase the retail price of wine, which could have an adverse effect on demand for wine in general. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees or excise taxes on wine, if enacted, could reduce demand for wine and have an adverse effect on Crimson’s business, negatively impacting Crimson’s results of operations and cash flows.
 ﻿
 Crimson is also subject to a broad range of federal and state regulatory requirements regarding its agricultural operations and practices. Crimson’s agricultural operations are subject to regulations governing the storage and use of fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, pesticides, fuels, solvents and other chemicals. These regulations are subject to change and conceivably could have a significant impact

on operating practices, chemical usage, and other aspects of Crimson’s business.
 ﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement and transportation of grapes. The wine industry in general historically experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues and net income. Typically, Crimson has lower sales and net income during the first quarter and higher sales and net income during the fourth quarter due to seasonal holiday buying as well as wine club shipment timing. Crimson expects these trends to continue. 
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2016, Crimson employed 177 regular, full-time employees. Crimson also employs part-time and seasonal workers for its vineyard, production and hospitality operations. None of Crimson’s employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and Crimson believes that its relationship with its employees is good.
 ﻿
 Trademarks
 ﻿
 Crimson maintains federal trademark registrations for its brands, proprietary products and certain logos, motifs and vineyard names. International trademark registrations are also maintained where it is appropriate to do so. Each of the United States trademark registrations is renewable indefinitely so long as the Company is making a bona fide usage of the trademark. The Company believes that its trademarks provide it with an important competitive advantage and has established a global network of attorneys, as well as branding, advertising and licensing professionals, to procure, maintain, protect, enhance and gain value from these registrations.
 ﻿
