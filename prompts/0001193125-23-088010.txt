Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on February 16, 2021 and were formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “business combination”). We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and assets consisting almost entirely of investments held in the trust account. 
 Although we are not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a business combination, we have focused on sourcing business combination opportunities in industry sectors that are being fundamentally reshaped by the introduction of advanced technologies, such as robotics, automation and artificial intelligence (“RAAI”), commonly referred to as “Industry 4.0.” In addition to RAAI, which has been a key theme and focus in our search for a business combination opportunity, we have utilized the experience and relationship networks of our management team and board of directors to identify and review attractive and high growth opportunities in the environmental, social and governance, and specifically, the sustainability arena. We believe that companies in these sectors that are using advanced data analytics, software, artificial intelligence, and cutting-edge instrumentation and process automation to make their processes “intelligent” have a significant competitive advantage over those that have not yet embraced these solutions. Our focus on Industry 4.0, RAAI, and sustainability has been concentrated in various sub-verticals, such as robotics; artificial intelligence; mobility tech/autonomy; data management & analytics; augmented reality/virtual reality; manufacturing and operations automation; IoT; blockchain; DNA sequencing; energy storage; energy efficiency and decarbonization; renewable energy; energy and environmental/climate technology; smart grid/smart city; agriculture and food technology/innovation, recycling and remediation, advanced materials, and water and bioresources. 
 Our sponsor is Cascadia Acquisition Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). On February 22, 2021, our Sponsor paid $25,000 in consideration for 4,312,500 shares of Class B common stock (the “Founder Shares”), of which 562,500 shares were forfeited in October 2021 in connection with the expiration of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Prior to the closing of our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”), our Sponsor transferred 25,000 Founder Shares to each of our three independent directors and sold an aggregate of 937,500 Founder Shares to 12 qualified institutional buyers or institutional accredited investors that are not affiliated with us, our Sponsor, our directors or any member of our management, which we refer to as “anchor investors”. Each anchor investor agreed to (a) vote any Founder Shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination and (b) subject any Founder Shares held by them to the same lock-up restrictions as the Founder Shares held by our Sponsor and independent directors. 
 On August 30, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 15,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000, and incurring offering costs of $8,830,225 of which $5,250,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions. Each Unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value, and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated a private placement with our Sponsor of an aggregate of 5,000,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $5,000,000 (the “Private Placement”). Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share.

 Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on August 30, 2021, an amount equal to $150,000,000, or $10.00 per Unit, from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) in the United States maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. If we do not complete a business combination by August 31, 2023, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law). 
 The outstanding shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock upon the consummation of a business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with a business combination, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding after such conversion, including the total number of shares of Class A common stock issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of a Business Combination, excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities or rights exercisable for or convertible into shares of Class A common stock issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of working capital loans, provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. Holders of our Founder Shares waived this Anti-Dilution Adjustment with respect to any shares issued in connection with the consummation of the RealWear Business Combination. However, such holders may not waive this right in connection with any alternative initial business combination, if applicable. 
 Extension of Business Combination Period 
 On February 22, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders at which our stockholders approved an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”), to (i) extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination to August 31, 2023 (the “Extension”) and (ii) expand the methods that Cascadia may employ to not become subject to the “penny stock” rules of the SEC. We filed the Charter Amendment on February 27, 2023. 
 In connection with the approval of the Extension, holders of 14,710,805 shares of our Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.11 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $148.7 million. As a result, approximately $148.7 million was removed from the Trust Account to redeem such shares and 289,195 shares of our Class A common stock remained outstanding. 
 Business Combination Agreement 
 On February 5, 2023, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among the Company, CAC MergerSub, Inc., a Washington corporation (“Merger Sub”), and RealWear, Inc., a Washington corporation (“RealWear”). The Business Combination Agreement provides, among other things, that on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into RealWear, with RealWear surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement are referred to hereinafter as the “RealWear Business Combination.” 
 The Business Combination Agreement and the RealWear Business Combination were approved by the boards of directors of each of Cascadia and RealWear. The RealWear Business Combination is expected to close in the second half of 2023, following the receipt of the required approvals by the stockholders of Cascadia and shareholders of RealWear and the fulfillment of regulatory requirements and other customary closing conditions.

 In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Business Combination Agreement: (i) immediately prior to the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”), the outstanding shares of each class of RealWear’s preferred stock will be converted into shares of common stock of RealWear; and (ii) at the Closing, (A) outstanding shares of common stock of RealWear (other than treasury shares and any Company Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement)), will be automatically converted into the right to receive shares of common stock of Cascadia (“Cascadia Shares”), (B) each of RealWear’s outstanding options will be converted into an option to purchase Cascadia Shares having substantially similar terms and conditions as such outstanding RealWear option, and (C) each of RealWear’s outstanding warrants will be converted into a warrant to acquire Cascadia Shares having substantially similar terms and conditions as such outstanding RealWear warrant, and in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, RealWear shareholders will be entitled to receive up to an aggregate of 4,170,000 additional Cascadia Shares (the “Earn Out Shares”), contingent upon the achievement of certain stock price targets of Cascadia Shares during the five year period following the Closing (the “Earn Out Period”). The Earn Out Shares will be placed in escrow at Closing and any Earn Out Shares remaining in escrow following the expiration of the Earn Out Period will be distributed to Cascadia and promptly cancelled. 
 The Business Combination Agreement requires that, as a condition to RealWear’s obligation to consummate the RealWear Business Combination, the sum of the aggregate cash proceeds available for release to the Company or Merger Sub from the Trust Account as of immediately prior to the Closing (after reduction for amounts payable to Cascadia stockholders with respect to valid redemptions of Cascadia Shares and payment of all unpaid transaction expenses of Cascadia and RealWear) plus the aggregate cash proceeds actually received in respect of any applicable financing transactions (whether on or prior to the date of the Closing) equals or exceeds $20,000,000. In addition, the Business Combination Agreement allows RealWear to terminate the RealWear Business Combination in its discretion if, as of April 6, 2023, the aggregate value of our Public Shares committed to be held in trust through the Closing (based on the per-share amount held in our Trust Account) and the aggregate proceeds to be paid in connection with any committed financing transactions do not equal at least $25,000,000. 
 Upon closing of the RealWear Business Combination, the combined company will be named RealWear, Inc. and is expected to trade on the Nasdaq. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and build a company that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from its strategic and operational expertise. After our initial business combination, we envision our strategy may include additional mergers and acquisitions and the application of new technologies and/or other operational improvements with a focus on generating attractive long-term risk adjusted returns for our stockholders. We have been leveraging our management team’s and Cascadia Capital’s network of potential transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience could catalyze a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses to enhance their overall value. We have also benefitted from our engagement of Cascadia Capital, LLC as a financial advisor on our business combinations and other transactions. 
Investment Criteria 
 Based on our management’s experience, we developed the following non-exclusive investment criteria that we have been using to screen for and evaluate prospective target businesses. 
 

• | Companies that operate in industries and sectors that are ripe for technological disruption or are currently undergoing technological transformations. We have identified industries and sectors that are in the process of, or have significant potential to benefit from and adopt, an Industry 4.0 solution, and have been searching for potential business combination targets that are well positioned to capitalize on this trend, which we believe is driving high growth opportunities in sectors that align well with our experience and expertise, such as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (RAAI) and ESG (Sustainability).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Companies with an attractive and defensible competitive position. We are targeting companies with market positions and technologies that we believe offer long-term competitive advantages. These could include proprietary technology, a market leading product suite, unique processes, strong market share, or a culture of innovation that we believe is enduring and unique.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Clear Benefit from a Business Combination with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company. We have been seeking a business that has a clear use of proceeds and a clear catalyst or inflection point resulting from our capital, team, public listing, roll-up synergies, deleveraging and/or re-rating milestones expected to propel the business through our structural dilution in the near term with enhanced financial results, margins, market position and stockholder value.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tangible Benefit from our Capabilities. We have been seeking a business where the collective capabilities of our management and Sponsor, and any operating partners we involve, can be leveraged to tangibly improve the operations and market position of the target.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary and/or High Conviction Transactions. We have leveraged our business network to source our initial business combination on a proprietary basis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Committed and Capable Management Team. We have been seeking a business with a management team whose interests are aligned with our strategic focus and who can clearly and confidently articulate the business plan and market opportunities to public market investors. Where necessary, we may also look to complement and enhance the capabilities of the target business’s management team and their board of directors by recruiting additional talent through our network of contacts or otherwise. This may include recruiting experienced industry professionals, or operating partners, to assist in our evaluation of the opportunity and marketing of the business combination prior to its completion, who may assume an ongoing role with the business or board thereafter.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to Grow, including Through Further Acquisition Opportunities. We have been seeking a business that has the potential to grow organically and inorganically through additional acquisitions, with management having identified a pipeline of potentially actionable accretive acquisitions. We expect to work with the ongoing management team to develop the business strategy around geographic expansion, new products, high-return capital expenditure projects and acquisitions, as well as creating and maintaining the optimal capital structure for growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preparedness for the Process and Public Markets. We have been seeking a business that has, or can put in place prior to the closing of a business combination, the governance, financial systems and controls required in the public markets. Specifically, we are seeking to avoid situations where extensive accounting or restructuring work is required with an uncertain timetable or outcome before a transaction can be completed.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC. 
 Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended, the “amended and restated certificate of incorporation”) contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to the Initial Public Offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of 65% of our Class A and Class B common stock. Our Sponsor, independent directors and anchor investors (collectively, the “initial stockholders”), who collectively beneficially own approximately 92.8% of our Class A and Class B common stock, may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

• | If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by August 31, 2023 (the “Deadline Date”), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the holders of our Class A common stock (the “public stockholders”) as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the requirements of other applicable law;

• | Prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the Trust Account or (ii) vote as a class with our Public Shares (a) on our initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond the Deadline Date or (y) amend the foregoing provisions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, the Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If our stockholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 31, 2023, or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will not redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 unless we are otherwise exempt from the provisions of Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our Units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.

 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of RealWear or any potential alternative business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) sent to stockholders. These financial statements in the case of the RealWear Business Combination are, and in the case of an alternative business combination may be, required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the historical financial statements are required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”). We cannot assure you that RealWear or any potential alternative target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that any applicable requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. 
 We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
