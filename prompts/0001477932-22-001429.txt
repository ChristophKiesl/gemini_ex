CORPORATE OVERVIEW

We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.

The address of our principal executive office is located at 10100 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 300, Century City, CA 90067 USA.

Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “CCOB”.

CORPORATE HISTORY

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 29, 2008, under the name “Mayetok, Inc.”. As Mayetok, Inc. we were engaged in the development of a website to market vacation properties in the Ukraine.

On June 8, 2010, we initiated a one (1) old for 35 new forward stock splits of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 100,000,000 to 3,500,000,000 shares of common stock and the issued and outstanding increased from 2,200,000 shares of common stock to 77,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001.

Also, on June 8, 2010 we changed our name from “Mayetok, Inc.” to “First American Silver Corp.”, by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary First American Silver Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name. We changed the name of our company to reflect the new direction of our company in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing mineral properties.

On June 18, 2018, we changed our name from “First American Silver Corp.” to “Century Cobalt Corp.”, by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary Century Cobalt Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name. We changed the name of our company to reflect the new direction of our company in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing cobalt mineral properties. Our name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Markets at the opening of trading on June 18, 2018, on which date we adopted the new stock symbol “CCOB”.

OUR CURRENT BUSINESS

On September 14, 2021, the Company signed a share purchase agreement to sell the assets of Emperium 1 Holdings Corp to Technology Minerals PLC, a related party. Technology Minerals PLC became a UK public company during the three months ended August 31, 2021. The Company was issued 420,000,000 unregistered shares (0.001£ par value) of Technology Minerals PLC common stock during November 11, 2021. The Company owns approximately 39% of the outstanding shares of Technology Minerals PLC. To date, Century Cobalt has focused on exploring and developing its large Emperium Cobalt Project to take advantage of the growing demand for secure, domestic cobalt supplies, but the Director believe that a sale of its assets to Technology Minerals, PLC represents an attractive and quicker route to monetize the project.

The Company is currently seeking other opportunities which will enhance shareholder value over the long-term in the mineral exploration and other industries. 

COMPETITION

The mineral exploration industry is highly competitive. We are a new exploration-stage company and have a weak competitive position in the industry. We compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world together with the equipment, labor and materials required to operate on those properties. Competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders.

Many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests or explore and develop our current or future mineral exploration properties.

We also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such companies. The presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our acquisition or exploration programs if investors perceive those investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral exploration properties or the price of the investment opportunity. In addition, we compete with both junior and senior mineral exploration companies for available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, land specialists, engineers, camp staff, helicopters, float planes, mineral exploration supplies and drill rigs.

General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of the United States and other countries, as well as factors beyond our control, including international political conditions, overall levels of supply and demand for mineral exploration.

In the face of competition, we may not be successful in acquiring, exploring or developing profitable mineral properties or interests, and we cannot give any assurance that suitable oil and gas properties or interests will be available for our acquisition, exploration or development. Despite this, we hope to compete successfully in the mineral exploration industry by:


· | keeping our costs low; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | relying on the strength of our management’s contacts; and 
· | using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Any operations at our cobalt properties will be subject to various federal and state laws and regulations in the United States which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We will be required to obtain those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct exploration and other programs. There are no current orders or directions relating to us or to our cobalt properties with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. Such compliance may include feasibility studies on the surface impact of our proposed operations, costs associated with minimizing surface impact, water treatment and protection, reclamation activities, including rehabilitation of various sites, on-going efforts at alleviating the mining impact on wildlife and permits or bonds as may be required to ensure our compliance with applicable regulations. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with such compliance could become so prohibitive that we may decide to not proceed with exploration, development, or mining operations on any of our mineral properties. We are not presently aware of any specific material environmental constraints affecting our properties that would preclude the economic development or operation of property.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements.

While our intended projects and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the past three fiscal years.

PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT

We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment over the twelve months ending November 30, 2022.
