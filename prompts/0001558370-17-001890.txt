 Overview 
 We are a rapidly growing diagnostics company with proprietary molecular and bioinformatics technology that we are deploying to change the management of genetic disease worldwide. Our novel molecular assays reliably measure many informative regions across the genome from samples as small as a single cell. Our statistical algorithms combine these measurements with data available from the broader scientific community to detect a wide range of serious conditions with best-in-class accuracy and coverage. Our goal is to develop and commercialize non- or minimally-invasive tests to determine the likelihood of a wide range of genetic conditions. Our tests are used for the detection of genetic variations covering a broad set of diseases, such as Down syndrome, which can enable diagnosis and treatment. Our technology has been proven clinically and commercially in the prenatal testing space. We believe this success can be translated into the liquid biopsy space, and we are leveraging our core expertise to develop products for oncology applications. In addition to our direct sales force in the United States, we have a global network of approximately 70 laboratory and distribution partners, including many of the largest international laboratories. We are enabling even wider adoption of our technology with our global cloud-based distribution model. We have launched seven molecular diagnostic tests since 2009, and we intend to launch new products in women’s health, prenatal testing and oncology in the future. In March 2013, we launched Panorama, our non-invasive prenatal test, or NIPT. Panorama represented approximately 66% of our revenues, with over 331,000 Panorama tests accessioned, during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our revenues have grown to $217.1 million in 2016 from $190.4 million in 2015 and $159.3 million in 2014. Our net losses increased to $95.8 million in 2016 from $70.3 million in 2015 and $5.2 million in 2014. 
 In both prenatal testing and oncology, the use of blood-based diagnostic tests offers significant advantages over older methods, but the significant technological challenge is that such testing requires the measurement of very small amounts of relevant genetic material circulating within a much larger blood sample. Our approach combines proprietary molecular biology and computational techniques to measure genomic variations in tiny amounts of DNA, as small as a single cell. Our molecular biology techniques are based on measuring thousands of SNPs simultaneously using mmPCR to multiplex, or target, many thousands of regions of the genome simultaneously in a single test reaction. Our method avoids losing molecules, which can happen when samples are split into separate reaction tubes, so that all relevant variants can be detected. We believe our approach represents a fundamental advance in molecular biology. This approach is distinct from the approach employed with other commercially available NIPTs, which use first-generation “quantitative”, or counting, methods to compare the relative number of sequence reads from a chromosome of interest to a reference chromosome. Based on extensive data published in the journals Obstetrics & Gynecology, the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, and Prenatal Diagnosis, we believe Panorama is the most accurate NIPT commercially available in the United States.
 To make sense of this deep and rich set of biological data and deliver a diagnosis, we have developed computationally intensive algorithms that combine the data generated by mmPCR with the ever-expanding set of publicly available data on genetic variations. Our technology is compatible with standard equipment used globally and a range of NGS platforms, and we have optimized our algorithms to enable laboratories around the world to run diagnostic tests locally and access our algorithms in the cloud. 
 We believe that our mmPCR technology and proprietary algorithms, which have been proven in the context of NIPT, can be a powerful tool in oncology applications such as recurrence monitoring, therapy monitoring and early detection screening. In oncology, we have demonstrated our ability to detect both CNVs and SNVs from very low concentrations of tumor DNA circulating in a blood sample, or ctDNA. Because lung, ovarian and breast cancer are driven,

to varying degrees, by a combination of CNVs, SNVs and gene fusions, we believe that our approach is well-suited for recurrence monitoring, therapy selection and early detection for these cancers. 
 Genetics Primer
 Genetic inheritance is conveyed through DNA, a naturally occurring information storage system. DNA stores information in a linear sequence of the chemical bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine, represented by the symbols A, C, G, and T. Billions of bases of A, C, G, and T link together inside living cells to form the genome, which can be read like a code or a molecular blueprint for life. While differences in the specific sequence and structure of this code drive biological diversity, certain variations can also cause disease. Examples of genetic diversity include CNVs and SNVs. A CNV is a genetic mutation in which relatively large regions of the genome have been deleted or duplicated, and an SNV is a mutation where a single base has changed. When single base changes are common in the population, that position on the chromosome, or loci, is called a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP. Our Solution 
 Our technologies allow us to achieve a high signal to noise ratio when detecting fragments of DNA from samples as small as a single cell, which allows us to deliver screening tests with differentiated specificity, sensitivity, and coverage. From a single blood draw, our current commercial tests assess the risk of a broad range of conditions, which we refer to as "coverage," including common fetal aneuploidies, microdeletions, triploidy, and inherited genetic conditions that could be passed on from parent to child. We sell our tests directly and partner with other clinical laboratories to distribute our tests globally. Currently, all of our products other than our Constellation cloud software product are LDT. We perform commercial testing in our CLIA-certified laboratory. 
 Our proprietary innovations in both molecular biology and bioinformatics drive performance of our current prenatal genetic tests and our development pipeline. Our mmPCR technology optimizes the behavior of primers in a reaction to generate a high-resolution measurement of thousands of DNA loci in patient samples. As a result, we can capture mutations from a single DNA fragment within a large background of extraneous DNA found in a patient's blood sample. We believe our molecular technology has the potential to enable a broad range of applications in prenatal diagnostics and cancer. For example, the ability to target primers in a specific area of chromosome 22 allows our prenatal microdeletions panel to assess the risk of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22, with demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than other commercially available tests. If identified during pregnancy, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can be treated with early intervention at the time of birth to avoid seizures and reduce cognitive impairment.
 An illustration of the resolution that can be achieved with our mmPCR capability is provided below. The figures display data from our approximately 20,000 primer mmPCR assay, where each assay targets one SNP. On the left, the assay is applied to a large genomic DNA sample from a child. On the right, the assay is applied to a single cell from the same child. Each dot represents data from a particular SNP location on a chromosome. The assay measures the amount of each of the two possible sequences of nucleotides, or alleles, at each SNP. The plots below show the relative proportion of the two alleles, plotted along the vertical axis, for each of the approximately 20,000 SNPs, arranged sequentially along the vertical axis. The two alleles are arbitrarily labeled A and B, and each dot is colored according to the allelic contribution of the mother—red (A) or blue (B). Those SNPs where both copies of DNA in the child contain only the A allele are red and are found at the very top of the plot, and those SNPs where both copies of DNA in the child contain only the B allele are blue and are found at the very bottom of the plot. The SNPs where the fetus contains at least one copy of the A allele and one copy of the B allele are found near the center of the plot. The four vertical bars separated by dotted lines display data from chromosomes 13, 18, 21 and X. For chromosomes 13, 18 and X, the middle band is centered on 0.5; which indicates that for those SNPs, the child has one copy of the A allele and one copy of a B allele (and therefore a relative proportion of 0.5), and, therefore, has the right number of chromosomes—two. In this sample, an additional chromosome is present at chromosome 21, which indicates the presence of trisomy 21. For chromosome 21, the bands centered at 0.33 and 0.66 signal the additional nucleotides contributed by the mother. The band centered at 0.33 represents SNPs where the child has two copies of the B allele and one copy of the A allele, and the band centered at 0.66 represents SNPs where the child has two copies of the A allele and one copy of the B allele. The assay clearly quantifies the difference between single 

 
  6

 
molecules of a particular allele at each SNP. The images demonstrate our ability to derive actionable information from tiny quantities of DNA, as the data from a single cell in the image on the right is nearly as informative as the data from a large genomic sample in the image on the left. 
         Our bioinformatics technology complements our molecular technology to deliver a risk assessment with high sensitivity and specificity. We use proprietary statistical techniques to combine the measurements of our molecular assays with our internal databases and the vast and growing sources of publicly available genomic information to build highly detailed models of the genome of interest. This process includes the use of a statistical technique known as maximum likelihood estimation, or MLE, which is widely used in other industries, such as in the conversion of a noisy transmitted analog communications signal to a digital format. However, it is computationally complex to leverage this technique to combine genomic information from the patient's sample and information from the databases of the broader scientific community. We have issued U.S. patents claiming methods to do so and pending applications in the United States and abroad. We also maintain trade secrets on our processes and practices. Our proprietary solution using MLE enables us to continuously improve the performance of our existing tests and efficiently develop new ones. As our patient volumes grow, our internal database of samples with genetic mutations and corresponding clinical outcomes further enhances our ability to interpret the clinical significance of complex genetic mutations. As the genomic data from the scientific community, such as from the Cosmic Database and the Cancer Genome Atlas, becomes richer, we can seamlessly integrate new clinical knowledge into our bioinformatics algorithm, driving further improvement in our tests. 
 Panorama
 We launched our Panorama NIPT in 2013 and our microdeletions panel for Panorama in 2014. Panorama demonstrates the capabilities of our technology by employing our fundamentally unique approach of simultaneously measuring thousands of SNPs in a single test reaction to identify genetic variations in fetal DNA with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity. 
 Panorama helps physicians assess the risk of fetal genetic abnormalities by non-invasively screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome, Patau syndrome, Turner syndrome and triploidy, which often result in intellectual disability, severe organ abnormalities and death of the fetus. Panorama can also identify fetal sex. Panorama is performed on a maternal blood sample, and can be performed as early as nine weeks into a pregnancy, which is significantly earlier than traditional methods, such as serum protein measurement where doctors measure the presence and amount of certain hormones in the blood. Panorama starts with a simple blood draw from the mother, either in a doctor's office, in a laboratory or through a phlebotomist that may travel to the patient. Currently, all samples are then sent to our CLIA-certified laboratory in California. We extract DNA from each sample, amplify the specific SNPs that we are interested in measuring and then sequence the DNA using NGS. Using our proprietary 

 
  7

 
bioinformatics technology, we analyze the DNA sequences to assess the state of the fetal genome, focusing on the SNP data, while incorporating public information from the Human Genome Project. Our bioinformatics algorithm builds billions of detailed models of the potential genetic state of the sample to determine the most likely diagnosis. After Panorama generates its result, we provide the doctor or the laboratory with a simple report showing the risk that abnormalities are present in the fetus. In 2016, we averaged approximately 99.5% of Panorama results delivered within ten calendar days after we received the blood sample. 
 The analytic and clinical validity of our technology demonstrated in Panorama and our other products has been described in multiple peer-reviewed publications, including the journals Clinical Embryology, Translational Oncology, Science, Human Reproduction, Molecular Human Reproduction, Fertility and Sterility, PLOS ONE, Genetics in Medicine, Prenatal Diagnosis, Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Genome Medicine, and American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Based on data published in Prenatal Diagnosis, Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy and Obstetrics & Gynecology, Panorama demonstrated greater than 99% overall sensitivity for aneuploidies on chromosomes 13, 18 and 21 and triploidy and specificity of greater than 99.9% (less than 0.1% false positive rate) for each disorder, which we believe makes it overall the most accurate NIPT commercially available in the United States. A paper published in the August 2014 issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology reported that Panorama had a statistically significant lower false positive rate than other NIPT methods practiced by our U.S. competitors. Based on data published in Obstetrics & Gynecology, Prenatal Diagnosis, and American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, we have also demonstrated the ability to identify fetal sex more accurately than competing NIPTs. This is partially a result of Panorama's unique ability to detect a vanishing twin, which is a known driver of fetal sex errors with quantitative methods used by our competitors. The October 2014 issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology noted that the ability of Panorama to identify additional fetal haplotypes is expected to result in fewer false positive calls and prevent incorrect fetal sex calls. A study reporting on the use of Panorama in over 30,000 women, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, supported the use of NIPT as a first-line screening test for aneuploidy.
 We believe Panorama's specificity and sensitivity can give patients and their physicians a greater degree of comfort in choosing to forego unnecessary confirmatory invasive procedures, lowering the total cost to the healthcare system of these procedures and limiting the resulting risk of spontaneous miscarriage associated with invasive procedures.
 Panorama screens for common genetic conditions that affect both high-risk pregnancies, where maternal age is over 35 and which represent approximately 600,000 pregnancies in the United States, and average-risk pregnancies, which represent approximately 3.3 million pregnancies in the United States. By recognizing early on the importance of NIPT to average-risk pregnancies and maintaining a focus on this market, we are strategically positioned to capitalize on what we believe will be increased penetration and reimbursement of NIPT in all risk categories. NIPT has not historically been well reimbursed for the average-risk population; however, commercial payers representing over half of all commercial covered lives in the United States now have a positive coverage determination for NIPT for average-risk pregnancies, and we believe that this momentum will continue consistent with the growing consensus among physicians, professional societies, and third-party payers that NIPT is an appropriate screening tool for all pregnant women. The American College of Medical Genetics, or ACMG, is the most recent professional society that has advocated for broader adoption of NIPT, including supporting NIPT as an optimal initial screening test for all pregnant women, regardless of age or other risk factors. Furthermore, we believe that data from our DNAFirst study, showing that NIPT can be effectively and appropriately offered as a primary screen for all pregnant women regardless of risk due to maternal age or other factors, will be particularly important in driving further progress in average-risk NIPT reimbursement. These results were published in January 2017 in Genetics in Medicine. As part of this trial, we ran the Panorama test on over 2,600 pregnant women through Women and Infants Hospital in Rhode Island. DNAFirst was the first study demonstrating routine clinical use of cfDNA-based prenatal screening for common aneuploidies in a general U.S. population, offered through primary obstetric care providers.
 Our Panorama microdeletions panel screens for five of the most common genetic diseases caused by microdeletions – 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (Di George syndrome), 1p36 deletion, Angelman syndrome, Cri-du-chat syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Microdeletions are missing sub-chromosomal pieces of DNA, which can have serious health implications depending on the location of the deletion. Unlike Down syndrome, where the risk increases with maternal age, the risk of these five microdeletions is independent of maternal age. Based on data published in Prenatal 

 
  8

 
Diagnosis and American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, the combined prevalence of these targeted microdeletions is approximately one in 1,000 pregnancies, which collectively makes them more common than Down syndrome for women younger than approximately 28 years of age. Diseases caused by microdeletions are often not detected via common screening techniques such as ultrasound or hormone-based screening, yet the presence of a microdeletion can critically impact postnatal treatment. For example, when learning prior to birth that a newborn has 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, or DiGeorge syndrome, doctors will know to deliver calcium to the infant to avoid seizures and permanent cognitive impairment and will know to avoid administering routine vaccinations due to the immunodeficiency frequently associated with this condition. 
 Panorama has demonstrated best-in-class performance screening for microdeletions. In validation studies, Panorama achieved sensitivity greater than 95% for deletions of approximately 2.9Mb for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and has been validated to perform at low fetal fractions, which refers to the percentage of fetal, as opposed to maternal, DNA in a maternal plasma sample. Based on data published in the January 2016 issue of Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology, Panorama demonstrated a PPV of 18% and false positive rate of 0.38% for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. We are also conducting a SNP-based Microdeletions and Aneuploidy RegisTry (SMART) study to evaluate the performance of SNP-based NIPT for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome by tracking birth outcomes in the general population among women who present clinically and elect Panorama microdeletion and aneuploidy screening as part of their routine care. We have enrolled more than 6,000 of the 10,000 total anticipated patients in this study. We expect to review perinatal medical records and collect postnatal DNA in order to perform genetic diagnostic testing for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. We will also collect follow-up genetic samples from all participants found to be at high risk either through NIPT or other means. Results from the follow-up specimens will be compared to those obtained by the Panorama screening test to determine test performance, particularly PPV.
 The Panorama microdeletions panel has conditional approval from the New York State Department of Health. 
 The graph below summarizes the incidence of genetic diseases for which prenatal screening is relatively common, as well as the incidence of genetic diseases caused by microdeletions that are screened by the Panorama microdeletions panel. Incidence rates are higher than that of many commonly tested disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. We estimate that triploidy and the aneuploidy and microdeletion conditions that we screen for combined are more 

 
  9

 
than three times as prevalent in the general population as the three most common autosomal aneuploidies, trisomies 13 (Patau syndrome), 18 (Edwards syndrome), and 21 (Down syndrome), alone.

 The graph below demonstrates how the relative incidence of Down syndrome and genetic diseases caused by the microdeletions screened for by the Panorama microdeletions panel varies with maternal age.

 2Snijders, et al. Maternal age and gestational age-specific risk for chromosomal defects.  Fetal Design Ther.  1995. 
 3Hall, PanoramaTM Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening for Microdeletion Syndromes. 2013.
     Because the microdeletions that we screen for are more common at birth than fetal aneuploidies for children born to younger women, and based on the performance of Panorama on microdeletions, we believe our microdeletions testing capability is a significant driver of Panorama adoption in all risk categories, including those who are traditionally considered average-risk. We intend to continue to work closely with physicians, medical societies, payers, patient advocacy groups such as the International 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome Foundation, Inc., and our laboratory partners to demonstrate that Panorama's sensitivity and specificity across a range of chromosomal abnormalities and superior false positive rates, coupled with disease coverage for conditions in which prevalence does not vary with maternal age, represent a compelling case for a continued shift towards broad adoption in the average-risk population. 
 Furthermore, we believe that we are well-positioned for what we anticipate will be stable reimbursement for NIPT for microdeletions over the long term. Significantly, the AMA has recently issued a CPT code for use in billing and reimbursement for microdeletions testing, and CMS has provided a pricing benchmark for aneuploidy and microdeletions testing. See “—Reimbursement.” Since several Medicaid programs haven't yet priced aneuploidy testing, we expect the pricing of aneuploidy set by CMS will increase the number of Medicaid programs that price the test and may result in Medicaid plans pricing microdeletions testing at a faster pace. In addition, although most commercial insurances have already priced aneuploidy testing, the price established by CMS for microdeletions testing can serve as a relevant benchmark for pricing discussions with commercial insurance plans to begin reimbursement for microdeletions testing. While we expect that our microdeletions reimbursement will decline, at least in the near term, either due to reduced reimbursement or third-party payers declining to reimburse under the new code, we believe that growing recognition from professional societies, combined with the performance of our microdeletions test and the additional validation data from 

 
  11

 
our SMART study that we expect to report on the sensitivity and specificity of our tests, will drive broader reimbursement in the future. 
 Since launching Panorama, we have implemented various updates to both the molecular and computational portions of Panorama, continuing to improve performance and reduce the cost of running the test. Previous updates have significantly reduced Panorama’s no-call rate, improved sensitivity at lower fetal fractions and simplified sample collection for clinics. We most recently updated Panorama in January 2017 to improve efficiency and further reduce costs by incorporating screening for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in our base Panorama panel. In validation studies, Panorama has demonstrated greater than 99% sensitivity and specificity for Down syndrome, and a combined sensitivity and specificity of greater than 99% across Down, Edwards, Patau and Turner syndromes. Furthermore, Panorama continues to maintain the highest commercially available sensitivity of over 95% for deletions of approximately 2.9Mb for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
 Panorama's commercial performance has been consistent with our initial validation data. Data published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology on 28,739 commercial cases of Panorama that were screened for Down, Edwards, Patau and Turner syndromes demonstrated per-indication sensitivities between 97.3% and 100%, and specificities of greater than 99.9%, for all indications. We believe Panorama's performance in commercial practice represents a significant improvement over first-generation NIPTs that rely on quantitative methods. Because Panorama does not require a reference chromosome, it is uniquely able to detect triploidy as well as full molar pregnancies. Panorama’s ability to differentiate between maternal and fetal DNA also allows Panorama to identify the presence of a vanishing twin, as well as maternal abnormalities, which have been shown in multiple studies to lead to false positives when using quantitative methods, particularly in the sex chromosomes where maternal abnormalities are common.
 Panorama has demonstrated substantial commercial success to date. We believe our test performance has allowed us to command a price premium compared to low-cost NIPTs while continuing to maintain growth in volume and revenue from Panorama.

 Horizon
 Horizon helps couples determine if they are carriers of genetic mutations that cause specific diseases. If the mutation is passed to a child, it could result in a child affected with the disease. Many people do not know they are a carrier for an inherited genetic disease until they have an affected child. These diseases are rare and usually there is no family history, although certain disorders are more common in certain ethnic groups. Horizon was created based on recommended screening guidelines from ACOG, ACMG, and the Victor Center for the Prevention of Jewish Genetic Diseases. Most conditions are autosomal recessive disorders, which means that both parents have to be carriers for their children to be at risk. Some conditions are X-linked disorders, which are inherited from a mother who is a carrier and primarily affect male children. If both partners are carriers for the same recessive genetic disease, the couple has a 25% chance of having an affected child in each pregnancy. If a woman is a carrier of an X-linked disease, she has up to a 50% chance of having an affected child in each pregnancy.
 Horizon screens for up to 274 inherited diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X syndrome and other conditions. The blood sample required for Horizon can be drawn simultaneously with that required for Panorama, which makes it easier for us to offer, and for patients to take, both tests. Horizon employs next generation sequencing to analyze the DNA from the individual’s blood or saliva sample to determine if the individual is a carrier for the genetic diseases being screened. Horizon test results are generally returned to the ordering physician in ten to 14 business days from the day we receive the sample, depending on the number of conditions the patient has requested to be screened.
 Constellation
 Our Constellation software forms the core of our cloud-based distribution model. Through this model, we have been able to expand access to our molecular and bioinformatics capabilities worldwide, enabling laboratories, under a license from us, to run the molecular workflows themselves and then access our computation-intensive bioinformatics algorithms through Constellation, which runs in the cloud, to analyze the results. As of March 1, 2017, seven licensees are using our Constellation platform commercially, including six in NIPT and one in prenatal paternity testing. We have licensing contracts with various other laboratories in the United States and internationally to develop products in both NIPT and oncology. Our licensees are in various stages of development and implementation of an NIPT product. We continue to engage in active discussions with potential licensees in the United States and abroad to continue to grow our cloud-based distribution network, which we believe will further enhance adoption of our tests among laboratory licensees globally. We also leverage Constellation to more efficiently perform our internal commercial laboratory activities and to perform research and development of our products.
 In July 2014, we achieved a CE Mark from the European Commission for our Constellation software. In May 2015, we achieved a CE Mark for the key reagents that our laboratory licensees need to run their portion of the Panorama test prior to accessing our algorithms through Constellation. These combined CE Marks enable us to offer Constellation for Panorama NIPT in the European Union and other countries that accept a CE Mark. We are pursuing other regulatory approvals, as needed, to allow the international roll out of Constellation in regions that do not accept a CE Mark.
 We believe that our cloud-based distribution model provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to: 

· | Improve patient experience. By eliminating the need to ship samples to our CLIA laboratory in California, patients benefit from faster turnaround times and lower costs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Drive higher rates of reimbursement for our laboratory licensees. We believe that our cloud-based distribution model allows many international laboratory licensees and their patients to achieve improved reimbursement from health insurance plans, as many state-administered and private payers in international markets require that the sample remain within national borders as a condition for reimbursement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Accelerate international adoption by leveraging our licensees' existing capabilities. Our laboratory licensees are able to offer tests under their existing laboratory certifications as required by local regulators,

leverage their local infrastructure for sample collection, and deploy local marketing capabilities to further increase test volumes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Efficiently achieve scale. The cloud-based distribution model allows us to leverage rapidly expanding sequencing capacity around the world to drive volumes faster than would be possible from the expansion of our own CLIA-certified laboratory capacity, and enables our laboratory licensees to drive volumes without significant incremental expenditures on information technology or investment in research and development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduce costs. As test volumes increase, the costs of shipping samples, particularly internationally, and labor costs in our CLIA-certified laboratory in California increasingly become the largest cost components. Our cloud-based distribution model eliminates these costs, expanding the margin opportunity for us and our laboratory licensees and better enabling our tests to withstand pricing pressure.

  Other products
 Our PGS and PGD tests, which we market under the Spectrum brand, are for couples undergoing IVF. Our PGS test screens embryos for chromosomal abnormalities prior to transfer of embryos created through IVF procedures, which have a high rate of non-viable chromosomal abnormalities. This allows IVF physicians to select and transfer embryos with normal chromosome results and, combined with single embryo transfer, greatly increases the rate of implantation and pregnancy, reduces the risks of a multiple pregnancy and may reduce the need for multiple costly IVF cycles. Our PGD test screens embryos for couples who are concerned about passing on a specific genetic defect to their child. 
 Anora is our POC product, which tests miscarriage tissue in women who have experienced one or more miscarriages to determine whether there was an underlying genetic reason for the miscarriage(s). The Anora product is helpful to obstetricians, gynecologists and IVF physicians in supporting their patients’ reproductive goals. Anora helps couples understand their future options, the likelihood of another miscarriage and whether there are any steps that may help them avoid a miscarriage in future pregnancies. 
 Our non-invasive prenatal paternity product allows a couple to safely establish paternity without waiting for the child to be born. Testing can be done as early as nine weeks in gestation using a blood draw from the pregnant mother and alleged father. Our internal data indicates that the accuracy of this test is greater than 99.99%. We have licensed this technology to a third party to perform the test in its clinical laboratory. 
 Evercord
 We have announced our plan to commercially launch Evercord, a private cord blood and tissue banking service, in the second quarter of 2017. This offering will enable expectant parents to collect, store and potentially retrieve their newborn’s cord blood and tissue for therapeutic use in transplantation and regenerative medicine applications. Cord blood, which is the blood contained in the placental blood vessels and umbilical cord, contains HPCs, which are blood-forming stem cells that are routinely used to treat patients with cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma, and other disorders of the blood and immune systems. HPCs are also found in bone marrow and peripheral blood, which is blood circulating in the body; however, there is evidence suggesting that cord blood HPCs may not require as exact a match as HPCs from bone marrow or the bloodstream do, and, as a result, transplants involving compatible HPCs from cord blood may be less likely to cause adverse reactions. Cord tissue, which is the tissue surrounding the umbilical vein and blood vessels in the umbilical cord, contains mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs. MSCs can inhibit inflammation following tissue damage, secrete growth factors that aid in tissue repair, and develop into many different cell types such as bone, cartilage, muscle and nerve cells. Although there are no medical treatments currently available using cord tissue or MSCs, MSCs have the potential to treat more conditions than HPCs alone, such as heart disease, Parkinson’s disease and lung cancer. Through Evercord, we offer 

 
  15

 
our customers the option to bank their child’s cord blood and tissue for potential medical use by the child or related family member. We believe that our Evercord offering is a natural extension of our mission and our experience in genetic testing, as our tests currently screen for 35 of the nearly 80 diseases in which cord blood stem cell treatment has been administered.
 Our Evercord service was created in partnership with Bloodworks Northwest, or Bloodworks, which currently operates a public cord blood bank at one of only seven FDA-licensed cord blood banking facilities. Bloodworks has 20 years of cord blood banking experience and nearly 1,000 cord blood units released for transplants. Under our service agreement with Bloodworks, Bloodworks will perform processing and infectious disease testing services on blood samples submitted by Evercord customers and will cryo-preserve the cord blood and tissue samples at its Seattle, Washington-based storage facility.
 Published data suggests that one in three people in the United States, or 128 million people, could potentially benefit from regenerative medicine applications of cord blood and tissue, if proven effective, which includes the possible therapeutic use of cord blood stem cells. More than 300 studies are currently underway, including clinical trials focused on current and new cord blood stem cell therapies in regenerative medicine. More than 30,000 cord blood stem cell treatments have been conducted worldwide. Based on the advances in research into stem cells and regenerative medicine, it is anticipated that number may continue to grow. We believe that Evercord will be well positioned to leverage our established commercial capabilities because we already engage with potential Evercord customers through our offering of Panorama and Horizon products. Also, we believe we can establish a relationship and level of familiarity and trust through our patient portal and healthcare provider digital services through Natera Connect, which puts us at a competitive advantage over other cord blood banking providers.
 New NIPT Panel
 We have announced our plans to launch a NIPT panel that identifies risk for severe cardiac, neurological and other conditions that have a combined incidence of approximately 1 in 600, which is higher than that of Down syndrome, and which are often associated with cognitive disabilities or require surgical intervention. These conditions may otherwise go undetected in prenatal ultrasound findings or may not present until much later in the pregnancy, after birth or even into childhood. Screening for these conditions early on in the pregnancy can facilitate early diagnosis, enable patients to be referred to MFMs and other specialists for targeted evaluations, guide labor and delivery management, and allow families to mobilize resources, ask questions and anticipate future needs. 
 We intend to initially launch this NIPT on a limited basis with MFM and key opinion leaders in the field, followed by a broader launch based on usage patterns and feedback from the initial launch.
 Direct Sales Force and Global Distribution Network 
 Through our direct sales efforts and worldwide network of approximately 70 laboratory and distribution partners, we have established a broad distribution channel. Our own direct sales force and managed care teams, which include approximately 130 genetics-focused sales representatives,  anchor our commercial engagement with physicians, laboratory partners, and payers, and sell directly to MFMs, OB/GYNs, physicians or physician practices, IVF centers, or integrated health systems. In the NIPT market, Panorama is typically ordered for a patient by an MFM or OB/GYN. There are over 37,000 OB/GYNs in the United States and most of them practice generalist medicine for women's health. They typically only assist women with average risk pregnancies and will refer women with high risk pregnancies to one of the more than 2,000 MFMs in the United States. We believe that Panorama will continue to be adopted by physicians for broader use in average risk pregnancies, and therefore anticipate that an increasing share of Panorama orders in the future will be attributed to OB/GYNs.
 Where our sales force can access physician offices directly, as in the U.S. market, we are able to maximize cross-selling opportunities by offering the full portfolio of our products. For example, we are promoting the use of Panorama NIPT, our Panorama microdeletions panel, and Horizon together for pregnant women who have not had a CS test at the time they are ready to have an NIPT performed. These tests can all be run using one blood draw from the mother and can be ordered on one requisition form and with one shipment of the patient’s samples by the physician. Also, because of the 

 
  16

 
importance and demand for screening for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, we have included that feature as part of our basic Panorama panel, unless the patient or physician ordering the test opts out of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome screen. In the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 78% of customers who ordered the basic Panorama panel directly from us also ordered screening for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome or the full microdeletions panel.
 As our direct sales force has gained experience selling under the Natera name, we have developed our own strong relationships, and we have been increasing the number of our in-network contracts with payers. We generate a higher gross margin when we sell testing services directly, compared to when our products are distributed by laboratory partners to be performed at our CLIA-certified laboratory. The percentage of our revenues generated through the higher margin U.S. direct sales force channel increased to approximately 78% in 2016, from approximately 77% in 2015 and approximately 59% in 2014. In January 2017, we terminated our licensing and distribution agreement with Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc., or Bio-Reference, a laboratory distribution partner that accounted for approximately 8% of our revenues in 2016, and began directly servicing the accounts that were previously ordering through Bio-Reference.
 In addition to our sales force, we market to physicians through clinical journals, educational webinars, conferences, tradeshows and e-mail marketing campaigns. While we do not sell directly to patients, we do engage in brand awareness campaigns directed at patients to highlight our products. Our marketing and medical science liaison team works extensively with key opinion leaders in the prenatal genetic testing field. We also dedicate resources to assist our laboratory partner network in marketing Panorama and our other products by conducting joint events, joint advertising and developing joint tools with our partner network. 
 We generate the highest gross margins on royalty revenue collected from laboratories that run tests in their own facilities and have the sequencing data analyzed by our Constellation software under our cloud-based distribution model. As of March 1, 2017, seven signed licensees are commercializing products using our Constellation platform. We have licensing contracts with other laboratory licensees, both in the United States and internationally, to develop their own NIPT LDTs and access our algorithm through our Constellation platform. 
 Our partners' capabilities augment our direct sales capabilities, and where we have identified laboratory or distribution partners who share our focus on premium quality and service, we also contract with them to distribute our tests. We have partnered with leading academic and commercial laboratories and hospital systems in the United States to capitalize on their relationships with MFMs and OB/GYNs, large distribution capabilities, and commercial infrastructure. These distribution partners also frequently have in-network contracts with key third party payers. As of December 31, 2016, we and our distribution partners had in-network contracts with insurance providers that accounted for over 203 million covered lives in the United States, of which approximately 188 million were under our direct in-network contracts. We continue to increase the number of our in-network contracts with payers. Our target market for NIPT is a much smaller subset of these covered lives, because it excludes men, children and post-menopausal women who would not be users of the majority of our products. Outside of the United States, where our products are sold in over 60 countries, we currently sell predominantly through partner laboratories. 
 Enhanced User Experience 
 Natera Digital Services
 We have implemented various digital services designed to enhance patient and provider experience. Our patient portal is a one-stop resource for patients to access information and services throughout their experience with our products, from pre-test to post-test. After logging on to the patient portal, patients are able to easily access information about our tests and services, order tests, track their status and access results, and pay their bill.
 Natera Connect is our physician portal, which enables physicians to easily complete various tasks online including ordering tests, tracking the status of a patient's test, reviewing patient results online, sharing results with patients, connecting with genetic counselors, ordering supplies and educational materials, and offering live chat support. We also provide a service to integrate with our customers' Electronic Medical Records, or EMR, systems to provide physicians a seamless experience of ordering tests and reviewing patient test results directly through their EMR systems.

 Access to Genetic Counselors 
 After receiving a report with results from any of our products, doctors have access by phone to our team of genetic counselors should they have any questions or require any guidance in interpreting the results. Patients themselves may contact our genetic counselors for information by phone either before or after taking one of our tests, with direct access provided to all patients who are tested with Spectrum or Anora and patients who have a high risk result for a genetic disease based on the Horizon screening or for a microdeletion syndrome based on the Panorama screening.  Phlebotomy Services
 We have engaged over 2,000 phlebotomy centers in the United States. We also offer mobile phlebotomy services whereby a patient can request and schedule a phlebotomist visit at the patient’s home or office. Our Development Pipeline in Oncology Diagnostics
 We believe that our ability to interrogate genes at tens of thousands of loci in parallel in a single reaction at the scale of a single molecule is well suited to the analysis of cancer-associated genetic mutations in circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA. In oncology applications such as recurrence monitoring, therapy monitoring and early detection screening, many loci must be interrogated simultaneously without splitting a sample, and achieving sensitivity to tiny amounts of tumor DNA as low as a single molecule is important. We are developing a set of mmPCR panels to analyze ctDNA in plasma and identify SNVs as well as CNVs. If development is successful, we expect to work towards commercializing non-invasive oncology diagnostic products designed to measure cancer recurrence and disease load monitoring, guide therapy selection and screen for cancer in high-risk populations. We are initially focused on recurrence monitoring in lung cancer and other cancers, and are exploring various candidates for recurrence monitoring as well as reflex testing, recurrence and disease load monitoring, and early detection screening in breast cancer.  To guide prognosis, predict relapse and assist in therapeutic decision-making, we may in the future develop a panel which would include known recurrent alterations that, when identified in blood at low levels, may indicate a residual presence of cancer that can remain in the patient after treatment and during remission. The panel would be used to detect variants from the initial tumor's molecular signature in low levels of ctDNA in blood prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms in order to assist in guiding earlier decisions regarding clinical management. We are working with world-renowned oncology centers, such as Stanford University, Columbia University, Vanderbilt University, UCSF/I-SPY and Cancer Research UK, on research collaborations and clinical trials to explore applications in various other cancer types and stages of diagnostic intervention for which we believe our performance in the detection of CNVs, SNVs, and gene fusions will allow us to achieve a competitive advantage.
 We have demonstrated that our mmPCR platform can provide highly accurate detection of CNVs and SNVs in the plasma from patients with cancer. In a study published in the October 2015 issue of Translational Oncology, we demonstrated the ability of our mmPCR platform to detect CNVs in plasma with DNA concentrations of under 1%, compared to other sequencing methods which require DNA concentrations of at least 4%, for samples with a single deletion or duplication event in a given loci. We believe that our ability to simultaneously detect both CNVs and SNVs in ctDNA at very low concentrations in standard plasma samples drives our potential opportunity in the oncology diagnostics space.
 Our mmPCR technology was selected for use in Cancer Research UK/University College London’s Tracking Cancer Evolution through Therapy (TRACERx) clinical trial for the multi-year monitoring of patient-specific SNVs in plasma, to understand the evolution of cancer mutations over time, and to monitor patients for disease recurrence. A pilot study using blood samples collected from the first 50 patients in the TRACERx trial was published in Annals of Oncology in January 2016, in which we demonstrated that our multiplexed PCR technology, coupled with our proprietary algorithms, can detect both ubiquitous (clonal) and heterogeneous (subclonal) tumor mutation variants in blood samples from patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. We were able to detect subclonal mutations at concentrations as low as 0.01% fraction of cell-free DNA. Of 37 variants found in tumor tissue biopsies from four patients with Stage I and II lung cancer, our technology detected 16 variants in the blood samples, with at least two detected for each patient. Twenty-five percent of the variants we detected in the blood samples were heterogeneous, meaning that they occurred in only part of a tumor. Ninety-four percent of the variants detected in the blood samples were predicted driver mutations, meaning that they were 

 
  18

 
likely to promote tumor growth. Analysis of cell-free DNA circulating in plasma may detect variants that, due to the heterogeneous nature of tumors, may not be detected by tissue biopsy. Detection of such variants may help physicians decide which cancer therapies are most appropriate for a specific patient. We have also received preliminary results from analysis of another 50 patients in the study, adding multiple longitudinal blood samples from patients who later relapsed. With these samples, we are exploring the application of our technology to detect recurrence 4 to 6 months earlier than standard biomarkers or imaging tools.
 We also have been participating in the Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and Molecular Analysis 2 (I-SPY 2) trial with the University of California, San Francisco and QuantumLeap Healthcare Collaborative. This trial was launched in 2010 and is a multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational therapies combined with early treatment in women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer. As part of this trial, we will analyze blood samples at various points throughout patient treatment to evaluate the effectiveness of liquid biopsy in monitoring tumor burden, treatment response, and residual disease, as compared to traditional imaging methods. 
 We anticipate that we will initially commercialize our cancer tests as LDTs in our own CLIA-certified laboratory; we also plan to offer these tests as IVDs through our Constellation platform. Beyond the products we develop ourselves, in order to access the many opportunities in oncology, we plan to offer our automated mmPCR design tool as a service to researchers and CLIA-certified laboratories, allowing them to design their own oncology diagnostics assays and perform their own studies using our Constellation cloud software. 
 Other Future Applications of our Technology
 We intend to refine and expand our offering in prenatal diagnostics by leveraging our core technology and the data we gather as our sample volumes grow. For example, the microdeletion samples that we gather through Panorama NIPT or through Anora POC testing help us to refine the algorithms that detect these anomalies, determine the exact genetic regions where these anomalies are sought, and increase the PPV with which they are reported. We have substantial intellectual property covering the analysis of single cells, an approach we use to analyze embryos during in vitro fertilization, or IVF, for our Spectrum products. We believe that our technology may allow us to capitalize on future advances in isolating fetal cells from a mother's blood, which could allow us to measure more of the fetal genome non-invasively and with even higher accuracy, which could enable us to replace invasive confirmatory procedures, such as amniocentesis, over time. 
 We believe that, in the future, our informatics technology may have the ability to generate a nearly full genome of an individual, roughly nine weeks after the individual is conceived. Publications in Genome Medicine, Science and PLoS Genetics highlight the ability of our informatics technology to determine, from tiny amounts of DNA as small as single fetal cells, which chromosome segments from the parent contributed to the DNA of the fetus and hence to substantially reconstruct the genome of the fetus using only a tiny amount of fetal DNA. This enhanced view of the near full genome, combined with knowledge of the parent DNA, has the potential to substantially impact the management of many aspects of an individual's health, from birth through adulthood. Future applications of such an offering may include prediction of disease susceptibilities and appropriate interventions, selection of drugs and drug dosages, nutrition guidance and many other emerging applications. 
 We have developed an automated tool for assay design that meaningfully streamlines our development process. When developing new diagnostic tests, we simply specify the genomic variations and regions we are interested in investigating, and our tool generates the precise mix of necessary primer designs to obtain an accurate measurement.
 We may also provide custom services for research in targeted assay design and bioinformatics interpretation, in oncology as well as in other areas. Custom panels may be designed for regions of interest in various research applications such as variant discovery and mechanism of action studies, among others, and clinical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. Some areas that we believe other researchers and laboratories may be interested in applying this technology are: cancer detection in liquid, e.g. bladder cancer, forensic identity analysis in mixtures for law enforcement, organ

transplant rejection monitoring, agricultural sample screening for patented lines, prenatal relationship testing for veterinary breeding and cell line purity testing for cell repositories.
 Key Relationships 
 We are party to a supply agreement with Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, for the supply of Illumina genetic sequencing instruments and reagents for NIPT, oncology and transplant diagnostic testing. For oncology, we also received rights to develop and sell in vitro diagnostic kits and services worldwide, in exchange for which we agreed to make certain milestone and royalty payments to Illumina. During the term of the supply agreement, which expires in June 2026, Illumina has agreed to supply us with sequencers, reagents and other consumables for use with the Illumina sequencers, and we must provide a forecast, on a monthly basis, detailing our needs for certain of the Illumina products. The first four calendar months of each forecast are binding and the fourth month can vary by only up to 25% more or less than what was forecasted for that month in the prior month's forecast. In addition, during each calendar quarter, we must spend a minimum amount on reagents under this agreement. We and Illumina have agreed on prices for the sequencers and reagents, for which we are entitled to certain discounts based on total spend and other factors. Illumina has the right to adjust these prices under certain conditions. In addition, we must pay a fee to Illumina for each clinical NIPT test that we perform using Illumina reagents. Illumina is currently the sole supplier of our sequencers and related reagents for Panorama, along with certain hardware and software; we are not bound to use exclusively Illumina's sequencing instruments and reagents for conducting our sequencing, but if we use other sequencing instruments and reagents for clinical use, we may no longer be entitled to discounts from Illumina. Illumina may terminate the agreement: if we materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of such breach, and only after complying with additional notice provisions; if we become the subject of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or in connection with certain changes of control of Natera. Illumina also has the right to terminate: (a) certain rights under the agreement upon two years’ prior notice, but no earlier than June 8, 2021; and (b) our rights with respect to IVDs if we have not obtained a premarket approval for at least one IVD from the United States Food and Drug Administration by June 8, 2021, unless we are diligently pursuing approval of an active PMA application at such time. We may terminate the agreement: if Illumina materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of such breach, and only after complying with additional notice provisions; if Illumina becomes the subject of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; in connection with certain supply failures by Illumina or for convenience with four months written notice. The agreement also contains use limitations, representations and warranties, indemnification, limitations of liability and other provisions.  Competition 
 We compete with numerous companies that have developed and market NIPTs, including Sequenom, Inc., or Sequenom, which was recently acquired by Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, or LabCorp; Illumina, through its Verinata division, Ariosa, Inc., which was acquired by F. Hoffman La-Roche Ltd in 2014; Counsyl, Inc.; Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, or Quest; Premaitha Health PLC; Beijing Genomics Institute; Berry Genomics Co., Ltd.; Progenity, Inc., or Progenity; LifeCodexx AG; Synlab International GmbH; and Multiplicom N.V., which was recently acquired by Agilent Technologies Inc. In addition, Bio-Reference, a business unit of OPKO Health, Inc., which was previously a laboratory distribution partner, is commercializing a competing NIPT. We expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the prenatal testing market, including through business combinations, and new tests and technologies are introduced. These competitors could have greater technological, financial, reputational and market access resources than us. 
 We also compete against companies providing carrier screening tests such as LabCorp; Counsyl, Inc.; Good Start Genetics, Inc.; Progenity; Recombine Inc.; Quest; NxGen MDx LLC; and GenPath Diagnostics, which is also a business unit of OPKO Health, Inc. Each of these companies offers comprehensive CS panels.
 In cord blood and tissue banking, we will compete with companies such as Cord Blood Registry, which was acquired by AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2015; ViaCord, a division of PerkinElmer, Inc.; Cryo-Cell International, Inc.; CorCell Companies, Inc.; and LifeBankUSA.

 
  20

 

 Our future products, such as products in the field of cancer, will face competition from various companies that offer or seek to offer competing solutions, such as Roche Molecular Systems Inc. and GRAIL, a spinoff of Illumina. In addition, Guardant Health, Inc., Personal Genome Diagnostics, Inc., Foundation Medicine, Inc. and Genomic Health Inc. have each developed and are offering liquid biopsy tests commercially in the United States, and Genomic Health Inc. has announced plans to commercialize Epic Sciences’ liquid biopsy test in the United States.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

· | test performance, as demonstrated in clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | comprehensiveness of coverage of diseases and ability to conveniently test for multiple conditions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | value of product offerings, including pricing and impact on other healthcare spending;

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Specific market share data regarding our products is not publicly available, and consumers may choose to use competing products for a variety of reasons, including lower cost. We believe, however, that we compete favorably in the market on the basis of several factors, particularly test performance, comprehensiveness of coverage of diseases, ability to conveniently test for multiple conditions, value of product offerings and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts. 
 Research and Development
 We were founded on the belief that serious unmet needs in healthcare could be addressed by combining traditional molecular diagnostics with robust statistical techniques, and this belief is the basis of our research and development efforts. We focus our research and development efforts on conceiving and delivering disruptive technologies to genetic testing. We have invested, and continue to invest, significant time and resources toward improving and expanding our core technologies and tests. Our proprietary automated tool for assay design meaningfully streamlines our development process. Research and development expenses were $41.9 million, $27.7 million and $17.3 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Intellectual Property 
 Our success and ability to compete depend in part on securing and preserving enforceable patent, trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property rights; operating without having competitors infringe, misappropriate or otherwise circumvent these rights; operating without infringing the proprietary rights of others; and obtaining and maintaining licenses for technology development and/or product commercialization. As of December 31, 2016, we held 18 issued U.S. and foreign patents and over 100 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. Our patents and patent 

 
  21

 
applications relate generally to molecular diagnostics, and more specifically to biochemical and analytical techniques for obtaining and analyzing genetic information to detect genetic abnormalities in relatively small complex samples, such as cell free fetal DNA or circulating tumor DNA. We intend to seek patent protection as we develop new technologies and products in this area.
 In the past, parties have filed, and in the future parties may file, claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. For example, we were recently engaged in patent infringement litigation with Sequenom. We cannot predict whether other parties will assert such claims against us, or whether those claims will harm our business. The field of non-invasive prenatal genetic diagnostics is complex and rapidly evolving, and we expect that we and others in our industry will continue to be subject to third-party infringement claims.
 Reimbursement 
 We receive reimbursement from commercial third-party payers and from government health benefits programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The tests for which we receive reimbursement include Panorama, Horizon, Anora and Spectrum. 
 Laboratory tests, as with most other healthcare services, are classified for reimbursement purposes under a coding system known as Current Procedure Terminology, or CPT, which we and our customers must use to bill and receive reimbursement for our diagnostic tests. These CPT codes are associated with the particular test that we have provided to the patient. Once the American Medical Association establishes a CPT code, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, establishes payment levels and coverage rules under Medicare while private payers establish rates and coverage rules independently. For most of the tests performed for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, laboratories are required to bill Medicare or Medicaid directly, and to accept Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement as payment in full. On January 1, 2013, CMS implemented a new set of CPT codes but without a fee schedule for the particular codes specific to NIPTs. A CPT code specific to NIPT for aneuploidies came into effect in January 2015. Additionally, CMS adopted a code set for diagnosis, commonly known as ICD-10, in October 2015. The AMA recently issued a CPT code for microdeletions, and CMS provided a pricing benchmark of $802 for aneuploidy and microdeletions testing, effective January 2017.
 We currently submit for reimbursement using CPT codes that, based on the guidance of outside legal and coding experts, are determined to be the most appropriate for our testing. There is a risk that these codes may be rejected or withdrawn or that payers will seek refunds of amounts that they claim were inappropriately billed to a specific CPT code. We do not currently have a specific CPT code assigned for all of our tests, and there is a risk that we may not be able to obtain specific codes for such tests, or if obtained, may not be able to negotiate favorable rates for one or more of these codes. In particular, while we have obtained a CPT code for microdeletions and CMS has set a price for microdeletions testing, we expect that our microdeletions reimbursement will decline, at least in the near term, because third-party payers are declining to reimburse under the new code or reimbursing at a much lower rate than we had previously received.
 NIPT has received positive coverage determinations for high-risk pregnancies and are reimbursed by most private payers, including United Healthcare, AETNA, Anthem, Humana, CIGNA and others. Reimbursement policies for the use of NIPT for average-risk pregnancies have not been widely established, but recent publications have analyzed the use of NIPT in the average-risk population and certain medical societies have supported such use. In particular, ACMG has recently issued updated guidelines that, among others, support NIPT as the optimal initial screening test for all pregnant women, regardless of age or other risk factors. ISPD has issued guidelines that are supportive of NIPT in average-risk pregnancies as well as high-risk pregnancies. ACOG and SMFM have each issued guidelines stating that while all pregnant women should be informed of the option to receive NIPT, conventional screening methods, rather than NIPT, remain the most appropriate choice for first-line screening for average-risk pregnancies. Private payers are moving towards reimbursing for average-risk NIPT. Thirty-six commercial payers in the United States, representing over half of all commercial covered lives in the United States, have a positive coverage determination for NIPT for average-risk pregnancies.

 
  22

 

 Based on AIS 2015 publication data, as of December 31, 2016 we and our laboratory partners had in-network contracts with insurance providers that accounted for over 203 million covered lives in the United States, of which approximately 188 million were under our direct in-network contracts. Our target market for NIPT is a much smaller subset of these covered lives, because it excludes men, children and post-menopausal women who would not be users of our products.
 Government Regulations 
 Our business is subject to and impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and internationally. These laws and regulations include regulations particular to our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally (e.g., export controls laws, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions). We also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies. Set forth below are highlights of the key regulatory schemes applicable to our business. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation 
 As a clinical laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal and state licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. As to federal certifications, in 1988, Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, establishing more rigorous quality standards for all laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal healthcare programs, as well as many commercial third-party payers, for laboratory testing services. Our laboratory located in San Carlos, California is CLIA certified. Our laboratory must comply with all applicable CLIA requirements. 
 CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality control procedures or facility requirements, or prescribe record maintenance requirements. We are required to meet certain laboratory licensing requirements for those states in which we sell products who have adopted regulations beyond CLIA. For more information on state licensing requirements, see "—California Laboratory Licensing" and "—New York Laboratory Licensing."
 Our laboratory has also been accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, which means that our laboratory has been certified as following CAP guidelines in operating the laboratory and in performing tests that ensure the quality of our results. 
 FDA 
 In the United States, medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, medical device development, testing, labeling, storage, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and promotion and product sales and distribution. To be commercially distributed in the United States, medical devices must receive from the FDA prior to marketing, unless subject to an exemption, either clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), or premarket approval, or a PMA.
 IVDs are a type of medical device that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases, conditions or infections, including, without limitation, the presence of certain chemicals, genetic information or other biomarkers. Predictive, prognostic and screening tests, such as carrier screening tests, can also be IVDs. A subset of IVDs are known as analyte specific reagents, or ASRs. ASRs consist of single reagents, and are intended for use in a diagnostic application for the identification and quantification of an individual chemical substance in biological specimens. ASRs are medical devices, but most are exempt from the 510(k) and PMA premarket review processes. As medical devices, ASRs have to comply with some quality system regulation, or QSR, provisions and other device requirements.

 
  23

 

 The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Many Class I devices are exempt from FDA premarket review requirements. Class II devices, including some software products to the extent that they qualify as a device, are deemed to be moderate risk, and generally require clearance through the premarket notification, or 510(k) clearance, process. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device's safety and effectiveness. Class III devices typically require a PMA by the FDA before they are marketed. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with any applicable FDA and Institutional Review Board requirements. Devices that are exempt from FDA premarket review requirements must nonetheless comply with post-market general controls as described below, unless the FDA has chosen to exercise enforcement discretion and not regulate them.
 510(k) clearance pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating to the FDA's satisfaction that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of PMA applications. The previously cleared device is known as a predicate. The FDA's 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take longer, particularly for a novel type of product. 
 PMA pathway. The PMA pathway requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA's satisfaction. The PMA pathway is costly, lengthy, and uncertain. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. As part of its PMA review process, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer's facilities for compliance with QSR requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. The PMA review process typically takes one to three years but can take longer. 
 De novo pathway. If no predicate device can be identified, the product is automatically classified as Class III, requiring a PMA application. However, the FDA can reclassify, or use "de novo classification," for a device for which there was no predicate device if the device is low- or moderate-risk. The FDA will identify "special controls" that the manufacturer must implement, which often includes labeling and other restrictions. Subsequent applicants can rely upon the de novo product as a predicate for a 510(k) clearance. The de novo route is less burdensome than the PMA process. A device company can ask the FDA at the outset if the de novo route is available and submit the application as one requesting de novo classification. The de novo route has been used for many IVD products. The FDA has indicated to us that our software that enables our cloud-based distribution model may be appropriate for review under the de novo classification process. However, the FDA has not committed to this position and may take a different position in the future.
 Post-market general controls. After a device, including a device exempt from FDA premarket review, is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, registration and listing, the Medical Device Reporting regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act). 
 The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an untitled or public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMAs already granted; and criminal prosecution. For additional information, see "Risk Factors—Reimbursement and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business." 
 Research use only. Research use only, or RUO, products belong to a separate regulatory classification under a long-standing FDA regulation. RUO products are not regulated as medical devices and are therefore not subject to the 

 
  24

 
regulatory requirements discussed above. The products must bear the statement: "For Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures." RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility, and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and is subject to FDA enforcement activities, including requiring the supplier to seek clearance or approval for the products. Our LDT uses instruments and reagents labeled as RUO. 
 Laboratory-developed tests. LDTs have generally been considered to be tests that are designed, developed, validated and used within a single laboratory. The FDA takes the position that it has the authority to regulate such tests as medical devices under the FDC Act. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion and has not required clearance or approval of LDTs prior to marketing. 
 On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents regarding oversight of LDTs. These draft guidance documents proposed more active review of LDTs. The draft guidances have been the subject of considerable controversy, and in November 2016, the FDA announced that it would not be finalizing the 2014 draft guidance documents. On January 13, 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper which laid out elements of a possible revised future LDT regulatory framework, but did not establish any regulatory requirements. 
 The FDA’s efforts to regulate LDTs have prompted the drafting of legislation governing diagnostic products and services that sought to substantially revamp the regulation of both LDTs and IVDs. Congress may still act to provide further direction to the FDA on the regulation of LDTs. 
 We believe that all of the tests we currently offer, including Panorama, meet the definition of LDTs, as we designed, developed, and validated them for use in our CLIA-certified laboratory. If our tests are LDTs, they are currently not subject to FDA regulation as medical devices.
 California Laboratory Licensing 
 In addition to federal certification requirements for laboratories under CLIA, we are required under California law to maintain a California state license for our San Carlos clinical laboratory. The California licensure law establishes standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control 
 If a clinical laboratory is found to be out of compliance with California standards, the California Department of Health Services, or DHS, may suspend, restrict or revoke its license to operate the clinical laboratory, assess substantial civil money penalties, or impose specific corrective action plans. 
 New York Laboratory Licensing 
 Because we receive specimens from New York State, our clinical laboratory is required to be licensed under New York laws and regulations, which establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including training and skill levels required of laboratory personnel; physical requirements of a facility; equipment; validation; and quality control.
     If a laboratory is found to be out of compliance with New York statutory or regulatory standards, the New York State Department of Health, or DOH, may suspend, limit, revoke or annul the laboratory's New York license, censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties. Statutory or regulatory noncompliance may result in a laboratory's operator being found guilty of a misdemeanor under New York law. Our clinical laboratory is licensed in the State of New York.
     DOH also must approve each specific LDT before the test is offered in New York. We have received a permit from New York to offer our basic Panorama test to women with high-risk pregnancies and a conditional approval to 

 
  25

 
offer both our basic Panorama and Panorama with the microdeletions panel to all pregnant women, regardless of risk. We also have a permit from New York to offer our Horizon, Spectrum, Anora and non-invasive prenatal paternity tests. 
 Other State Laboratory Licensing Laws 
 In addition to New York and California, other states, including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, require licensing of out-of-state laboratories under certain circumstances. We have obtained licenses in these four additional states and believe we are in compliance with applicable state laboratory licensing laws. 
 Potential sanctions for violation of state statutes and regulations include significant fines, the rejection of license applications and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could harm our business. CLIA does not preempt state laws that have established laboratory quality standards that are at least as stringent as federal law. 
 State Genetic Testing Laws 
 Many states have implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results. In some cases, we are prohibited from conducting certain tests without appropriate documentation of patient consent by the physician ordering the test. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. 
 HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws 
 The privacy and security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and require certain entities, called covered entities, to comply with standards that include the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA further requires business associates of covered entities – independent contractors or agents of covered entities that have access to protected health information in connection with providing a service to or on behalf of a covered entity – to enter into business associate agreements with the covered entity and to safeguard the covered entity's PHI against improper use and disclosure. In addition, certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards are directly applicable to business associates.
 As a covered entity and as a business associate of other covered entities (with whom we have therefore entered into business associate agreements), we have certain obligations regarding the use and disclosure of any PHI that may be provided to us, and we could incur significant liability if we fail to meet such obligations. Among other things, HITECH imposes civil and criminal penalties against covered entities and business associates for noncompliance with privacy and security requirements and authorizes states’ attorneys general to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 As noted above, we are required to comply with HIPAA standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. First, we must comply with HIPAA's standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures. We must also comply with the standards for the privacy of individually identifiable health information, which limit the use and disclosure of most paper and oral communications, as well as those in electronic form, regarding an individual's past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, or relating to the provision of healthcare to the individual or payment for that healthcare, if the individual can or may be identified by such information. Additionally, we must comply with HIPAA's security standards, which require us to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic protected health information that we create, receive, maintain or transmit, to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such information, and to protect such information from unauthorized use or disclosure.

 
  26

 

 Various states in the United States have implemented similar restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information that are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state affords greater protection to individuals than HIPAA. For example, Massachusetts law requires that any company that obtains personal information of any resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts implement and maintain a security program that adequately protects such information from unauthorized use or disclosure. There are also foreign privacy and security laws and regulations that impose restrictions on the access, use and disclosure of health information. As a business that operates both internationally and throughout the United States, any unauthorized use or disclosure of personally identifiable information, even if it does not constitute PHI, by us or our third-party contractors, including disclosure due to data theft or unauthorized access to our or our third-party contractors' computer networks, could subject us to costs, fines or penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including the cost of providing notice, credit monitoring and identity theft prevention services to affected consumers. 
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a felony for a provider or supplier, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any federal healthcare program. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil assessments and fines up to $50,000, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Although the federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies only to federal healthcare programs, a number of states have passed statutes substantially similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third-party payers. Actions which violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar laws may also involve liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
 Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals and opportunities. Law enforcement authorities, courts and Congress have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce future referrals. 
 The HHS Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has issued Special Fraud Alerts on arrangements for the provision of clinical laboratory services and relationships between laboratories and referring physicians. The Fraud Alerts set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories and healthcare providers that raise issues under the federal fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG emphasized in the Special Fraud Alerts that when one purpose of such arrangements is to induce referrals of government program-reimbursed laboratory testing, both the clinical laboratory and the healthcare provider (e.g., physician) may be liable under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and may be subject to criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, HHS has issued a series of regulatory "safe harbors" which provide confidence to healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute if they can demonstrate compliance with each element of the safe harbor. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. 
 While we believe that we are in compliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar laws, there can be no assurance that our relationships with physicians, hospitals and other customers will not be subject to scrutiny or will 

 
  27

 
survive regulatory challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or any similar state statute could have a negative effect on our business. 
 Because our laboratory is located in California, California law is applicable to our business arrangements. Both California's fee-splitting statute, Business and Professions Code Section 650, and its Medi-Cal anti-kickback statute, Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14107.2, have been interpreted by the California Attorney General and California courts in substantially the same way as the federal government and the courts have interpreted the federal Anti-kickback Statute. A violation of Section 650 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $50,000. A violation of Section 14107.2 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $10,000. 
 In addition to the requirements that are discussed above, there are other healthcare fraud and abuse laws that could have an impact on our business. The federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly submitting or causing to be submitted false claims or making a false record or statement in order to secure payment by the federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud sometimes referred to as a “whistleblower”. Because the complaints are initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the private party plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government's involvement, then the private party plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Violation of the federal False Claims Act may result in fines of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of up to approximately $22,000 for each separate false claim, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid. 
 We are also subject to a federal law directed at "self-referrals," commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits, with certain exceptions, payments made by a laboratory to a physician in exchange for the provision of clinical laboratory services, or presenting or causing to be presented claims to Medicare and Medicaid for laboratory tests referred by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, the clinical laboratory performing the tests. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law's referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare or Medicaid programs in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per claim submission, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed, and possible exclusion from participation in federal governmental payer programs. Claims submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited claim is obligated to refund such amounts. 
 Many states, including California, also have state anti-"self-referral" and other laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals, with which we must comply. We are subject to the California's Physician Ownership and Referral Act, or PORA. PORA generally prohibits us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payer for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician's immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. Further, a violation of PORA is a misdemeanor and could result in civil penalties and criminal fines. 
 Other states may have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by federal and California law. 
 We are also subject to applicable state client billing laws (also known as “pass through billing”), which specify whether a provider that did not perform the service is permitted to submit the claim for payment and if so, whether the non-performing provider is permitted to mark up the cost of the services in excess of the price the purchasing provider paid for such services. California has an anti-markup statute with which we must comply, which prohibits providers from charging for a laboratory test that it did not perform unless the provider (a) notifies the patient of the name, address, and charges of the laboratory performing the test, and (b) charges no more than what he or she was charged by the clinical laboratory which performed the test. A violation of this provision can lead to imprisonment and/or fines. Other states have similar anti-markup prohibitions with which we must comply. In addition, many states are so-called “direct-bill” states, which means that the services actually performed by an individual or entity must be billed by such individual or entity, 

 
  28

 
thus preventing ordering physicians from purchasing services from a laboratory and billing for the services they order at a higher price.
 While we have attempted to comply with the federal fraud and abuse laws, California fraud and abuse laws and similar laws of other states, it is possible that some of our arrangements could be subject to regulatory scrutiny at some point in the future, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review. 
 Further, in addition to the privacy and security regulations stated above, HIPAA created two federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. 
 Finally, federal law prohibits any entity from offering or transferring to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof) and transfers of items or services for free or for other than fair market value. Entities found in violation may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Although we believe that our sales and marketing practices are in material compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, relevant regulatory authorities may disagree, and violation of these laws or our exclusion from such programs as Medicaid and other governmental programs as a result of a violation of such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 852 employees, including 123 in laboratory operations and manufacturing administration, 188 in research and development and 541 in sales, general and administrative functions.

Natera, Inc.
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     1.    Description of Business
     Natera, Inc. (the "Company") was formed in the state of California as Gene Security Network, LLC in November 2003 and incorporated in the state of Delaware in January 2007. The Company’s mission is to change the management of genetic disease worldwide. The Company operates a laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ("CLIA") providing a host of preconception and prenatal genetic testing services. The Company determines its operating segments based on the way it organizes its business to make operating decisions and assess performance. The Company has only one operating segment, which is the discovery, development and commercialization of genetic testing services, and it has a subsidiary that operates in the state of Texas. 
     The Company's product offerings include its Panorama Non-Invasive Prenatal Test ("NIPT") that screens for chromosomal abnormalities of a fetus typically with a blood draw from the mother; Horizon Carrier Screening ("Horizon") to determine carrier status for a large number of severe genetic diseases that could be passed on to the carrier’s children; Spectrum Pre-implantation Genetic Screening ("PGS") and Spectrum Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis ("PGD") to analyze chromosomal anomalies or inherited genetic conditions during an in vitro fertilization ("IVF") cycle to select embryos with the highest probability of becoming healthy children; Anora Products of Conception ("POC") test to rapidly and extensively analyze fetal chromosomes to understand the cause of miscarriage; Non-Invasive Paternity Testing ("PAT"), to determine paternity by analyzing the fragments of fetal deoxyribonucleic acid ("DNA") in a pregnant mother's blood and a blood sample from the alleged father(s), which is marketed and sold exclusively by a licensee from whom the Company receives a royalty. All testing is available principally in the United States and Europe. The Company also offers Constellation (“Constellation”), a cloud-based software product that allows laboratory customers to gain access through the cloud to the Company’s algorithms and bioinformatics in order to validate and launch tests based on the Company’s technology.
     Initial Public Offering 
     In July 2015, the Company completed an initial public offering (“IPO”), and subsequently in August 2015, the Company completed the sale of additional shares upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. In connection with the IPO, including the over-allotment option, the Company sold 10,900,000 shares of common stock at $18.00 per share, which raised $178.5 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.             2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     Basis of Presentation
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). 
     Need to Raise Additional Capital 
     The Company has incurred net losses since its inception and anticipates net losses and negative operating cash flows for the near future. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $95.8 million, and as of December 31, 2016, it had an accumulated deficit of $345.9 million. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $15.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $130.9 million in marketable securities, and $49.6 million of outstanding debt with accrued interest. While the Company has introduced multiple products that are generating revenues, these revenues have not been sufficient to fund all operations. Accordingly, the Company has funded the portion of operating costs that exceeds revenues through a combination of equity issuances, debt issuances, and other financings. 
     The Company expects to develop and commercialize future products and, consequently, it will need to generate additional revenues to achieve future profitability and may need to raise additional equity or debt financing. If the Company 

 
  97

 
raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, its stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting its operations or its ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that the Company raises may contain terms that are not favorable to it or its stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, it may be required to delay the development, commercialization and marking of its products and significantly scale back its business and operations.  
     Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months after March 16, 2017. 
     Principles of Consolidation
     The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. The Company established a subsidiary that operates in the state of Texas in December 2014 to support the Company’s laboratory and operational functions, which became active in the second quarter of 2015. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.     Use of Estimates
     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, accrued liability for potential refund requests, stock-based compensation, the fair value of common stock and fair value of debt accounted for under ASC 815, as well as income tax uncertainties. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.      Fair Value
     The Company discloses the fair value of financial instruments for financial assets and liabilities for which the value is practicable to estimate. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company carried senior secured term loan and warrants at fair value according to the fair value measurement guidance.     Cash and Cash Equivalents
     Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market deposits with financial institutions.
     Restricted Cash
     The Company discloses both short-term and long-term restricted cash.  Short-term restricted cash consists of $1.1 million, which secured a $0.8 million letter of credit for the sublease of the First Space (defined in Note 6) that expired in October 2016, however, the associated restriction has not been released as of December 31, 2016, and a $0.3 million letter of credit for the sublease of the Second Space (defined in Note 6), which expired in January 2017. Long-term restricted cash consists of $0.3 million deposit per credit card terms.       Investments
     Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company generally classifies its entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale. The Company views its available-for-sale portfolio as available for use in current operations. Accordingly, the Company classifies all investments as short-term, even though the stated maturity may be more than one year from the 

 
  98

 
current balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity. 
     Risk and Uncertainties
     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash, accounts receivable and investments. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash in financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company's cash may consist of deposits held with banks that may at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company performs evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. 
     The Company bills third-party payers for certain tests performed. The amount that is ultimately received from the payer for the Company’s claim and the timing of such payments are subject to the determination of the payer based on the nature of the test performed and their view of the Company’s business practices with respect to collections of plan deductibles and co-payments from patients and other activities. This determination can impact both the amount and timing of when the Company’s invoices are collected. Payers may also withhold payments and request refunds of prior payments if the Company does not perform in accordance with the policies of these payers. 
     The Company performs evaluations of financial conditions for clinics and laboratory partners and generally does not require collateral to support credit sales. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no customers exceeding 10% in total revenue. As of December 31, 2016, one customer had an outstanding balance of approximately 52% of net accounts receivable, and as of December 31, 2015, no customers had an outstanding balance greater than 10% of net accounts receivable. 
     Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
     Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the amount billed to the laboratory partners and clinics. Reducing this amount is an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make the contracted payments. Management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance when there is substantive evidence that the account will not be paid.     Revenue Recognition
     The Company generally bills an insurance carrier, a clinic or a patient for the test upon delivery of the test result. The Company also bills patients directly for out-of-pocket costs not covered by their insurance carriers representing co-pays and deductibles in accordance with their insurance carrier and health plans. For tests performed, where an agreed upon reimbursement rate or fixed fee and a predictable history or likelihood of collections exists, the Company recognizes revenues upon delivery of the test report to the prescribing physician based on the established billing rate less contractual and other adjustments, such as an allowance for doubtful accounts, to arrive at the amount that the Company expects to collect. In all other situations, as the Company does not have sufficient history of collection and is not able to determine collectability, the Company recognizes revenues when cash is received. The Company may not get reimbursed for tests completed if the tests are not covered under the insurance carrier’s reimbursement policies or the Company is not a qualified provider to the insurance carrier. From time to time, the Company receives requests for refunds of payments previously made by insurance carriers. The Company has established an accrued liability for potential refund requests based on its experience, which is accounted for as reductions in revenues in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
     In cases where the Company sells its tests through its laboratory partners, the majority of the laboratory partners bill the patient, clinic, or insurance carrier for the performance of the Company's tests. 
     For tests sold through a limited number of its laboratory partners, the Company bills directly to a patient, clinic or insurance carrier, or a combination of the insurance carrier and patient for the fees. The Company considers its services 

 
  99

 
rendered when it delivers reports of its test results to the laboratory partner, clinic or patient. When the Company has contracted fixed rates for its services and collectability of its revenues is reasonably assured, it recognizes revenues upon delivery of test reports. The fixed fees identified in contracts with laboratory partners change only if a pricing amendment is agreed upon between both parties. For cases in which there is no fixed price established with a laboratory partner, the Company then recognizes revenues from partner distributed tests on a cash basis. 
     Certain of the Company's arrangements include multiple deliverables. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, the Company evaluates each deliverable to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting. This determination is based on whether the deliverable has "stand-alone value" to the customer and whether a general right of return exists. The consideration that is fixed or determinable is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized as the related goods or services are delivered, limited to the consideration that is not contingent upon future deliverables. The Company uses judgment in identifying the deliverables in its arrangements, assessing whether each deliverable is a separate unit of accounting, and in determining the best estimate of selling price for certain deliverables. The Company also uses judgment in determining the period over which the deliverables are recognized in certain of its arrangements. Any amounts received that do not meet the criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue until such criteria are met. 
     The Company receives royalty revenue through the licensing and the provisioning of services to support the use of the Company's proprietary technology with its customer. Royalty revenues are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements and are included in licensing and other revenues in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
     The Company recognizes revenue from the cloud-based distribution service offering. The Company grants its customers licenses to use the Company’s proprietary intellectual properties and the cloud-based Natera software, and provides the other services to support the use of the Company's proprietary technology with its customers. Natera’s proprietary software is used in connection with the analysis of DNA sequence data in a manner yielding a result indicating the likely presence or absence of full or partial chromosomal abnormalities. The licensees do not have the right to possess Natera software, but rather are treated as software as a service. The revenues are recognized on an accrual basis (assuming all revenue recognition criteria are met) under the terms of the related agreements and are included in licensing and other revenues in the statements of operation and comprehensive loss.
     Cost of Product, Licensing and Other Revenues 
     Cost of product, licensing and other revenues includes the cost of materials, direct labor of laboratory personnel, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing blood and other samples, quality control analyses, and shipping charges to transport samples and specimens from ordering physicians, clinics or individuals. Infrastructure expenses include allocated facility and related occupancy costs. Costs associated with the performance of diagnostic services are recorded as tests are processed.      Research and Development 
     The Company records research and development costs in the period incurred. Research and development costs consist of personnel costs, contract services, cost of materials utilized in performing tests, costs of clinical trials and allocated facilities and related overhead expenses.      Advertising Costs 
     The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. The Company incurred advertising costs of $0.4 million, $1.1 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
    
 
  100

 

 Product Shipment Costs 
     The Company expenses product shipment costs in cost of product, licensing and other revenues in the accompanying statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $8.2 million, $7.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively.      Income Taxes 
     Income taxes are recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Tax benefits are recognized when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained during an audit. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if current evidence indicates that it is considered more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized.
     Stock‑Based Compensation
     Stock‑based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to the Company’s employees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. No compensation cost is recognized on stock options for employees who do not render the requisite service and therefore forfeit their rights to the stock options. The Company uses the Black‑Scholes option‑pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock options.
     The Company accounts for stock options issued to non-employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest, and the resulting change in value, if any, is recognized in the Company's statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the period that the related services are rendered.
     The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of the Company's expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the awards, a risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Determining these assumptions requires significant judgment. The expected term was based on the simplified method and where the Company did not qualify to use the simplified method, the Company used the lattice model, and the volatility rate was based on that of publicly traded companies in the DNA sequencing, diagnostics, or personalized medicine industries. When selecting the public companies in these industries to be used in the volatility calculation, companies were selected with comparable characteristics to the Company, including enterprise value and financial leverage. Companies were also selected with historical share price volatility sufficient to meet the expected term of the Company's stock options. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the Company's stock options. The expected term of the non-employee option grants was based on their remaining contractual life at the measurement date. The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities that were consistent with the option's expected term. The expected dividend assumption was based on the Company's history and expectation of dividend payouts.
     Starting January 1, 2016, the Company uses a different approach to estimate the expected term of its stock option awards, which involves calculating the average of—(1) its employees’ historical stock option exercise behavior, and (2) the weighted-average of the time-to-vesting and the total contractual life of the options. The Company applied this change in methodology prospectively and accounted for it as a change in accounting estimate.
     Warrants
     The Company accounts for warrants to purchase shares of its common stock as a liability at fair value on the balance sheet date because the Company may be obligated to redeem these warrants at some point in the future. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value recognized as a gain or loss 

 
  101

 
from the changes in fair value of the warrants in the statements of operations. The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until such time that the warrants are converted or expire.
     Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use 
     The Company capitalizes costs of software held for internal use during the application development stage of a project and amortize those costs over their estimated useful lives of three years. The net book value of capitalized software held for internal use was $1.3 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortized expense for amounts previously capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively. There was no amortization of such capitalized costs for the year ended December 31, 2014.
     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss        Comprehensive loss and its components encompass all changes in equity other than those with stockholders, and include net loss, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. As of December 31, 2016, and 2015, accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of $0.7 million and $1.4 million of unrealized losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. There was $0.2 million reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2016, and no reclassifications were made in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  
     Property and Equipment
     Property and equipment, including purchased and internally developed software, are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The Company periodically reviews the depreciable lives assigned to property and equipment placed in service and change the estimates of useful lives to reflect the results of such reviews. During the third and fourth quarters of 2016, the Company performed an assessment on its estimated use of certain sequencing and automation equipment. As a result of the assessment, it was determined that the service lives of several of such equipment over which the remaining economic benefit was to be received from were significantly shorter than initially expected by the Company. Additionally, the Company wrote off the remaining maintenance service contract associated with the equipment described above. The Company accounted for the revision of its depreciation estimates on the sequencing and automation equipment and the write off of the unamortized prepaid maintenance as a change in accounting estimate, which increased its loss from operations and net loss by $1.7 million, and increased its basic and diluted net loss per share by $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company increased the depreciable lives of certain sequencing and automation equipment from three years to five years. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a decrease in loss from operations and net loss of $1.7 million, and a decrease in basic and diluted net loss per share of $0.07.       Impairment of Long-lived Assets
     The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company then compares the carrying amounts of the assets with the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset’s fair value determined using discounted estimates of future cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded asset impairment losses of $2.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively. See Note 5 for more detail about the asset impairment.       Inventory 
     Inventory is valued at the lower of the standard cost, which approximates actual cost, or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Inventory consists entirely of supplies, which are consumed when providing its test reports, and therefore does not maintain any finished goods inventory. The Company enters into inventory purchases and commitments so that it can meet future delivery schedules based on forecasted demand for its tests.

 
  102

 

     In December 2016, the Company determined $2.1 million of inventory as obsolete in connection with its impairment analysis of the associated automation and sequencing equipment described above, and recorded an associated charge for these materials.      
     Recent Accounting Pronouncements
     From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed below, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
     In August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014‑15 (“ASU 2014-15”), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. ASU 2014‑15 requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014‑15 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company has elected to early adopt this guidance for its annual reporting period ending December 31, 2016, and this ASU applies to all future annual and interim reporting periods. Upon adoption, the Company is required to perform assessment using detailed prospective financial information during each interim period and annually to determine whether substantial doubt exists about its ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements, and to provide the related disclosures. As a result of the analysis, the adoption of ASU 2014‑15 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures, although the related disclosures could be impacted in future periods.
     In May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (“ASU 2014-09”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers to provide guidance on revenue recognition.  To date, the Company’s revenues have been derived primarily from contracts with insurance carriers, patients, clinics and licensing arrangements. Approximately 82% of the Company’s revenues are recognized on the cash basis, and based on the Company’s preliminary assessment, this portion of revenues may be recognized at an earlier date than in the period of actual cash receipt. Consideration is received from either patients, clinics, or insurance carriers and/or any combination of the three, and licensees. Each one of these arrangements, whether sell-in or sell-through, is considered unique and being evaluated individually under the five-step process prescribed by the new revenue standard. Currently, the Company continues to assess its contracts with insurance carriers. The Company has not completed its analysis, and it is evaluating whether the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 will be material to its financial statements. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted starting the first quarter of 2017. Upon adoption, ASU 2014-09 can be applied retrospectively to all periods presented or using the modified retrospective approach, which requires the cumulative effect of changes reflected in the opening balance of retained earnings only in the most current period presented. The Company has not yet determined which method will be used upon adoption, and will plan on adopting the new guidance in the first quarter of 2018.
     In July 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11 (“ASU 2015-11”), Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (ASU 2015-11). ASU 2015-11 simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing today’s lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. ASU 2015-11 is effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015‑11 will have a material impact on its financial statements. 
     In November 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 (“ASU 2015-17”), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as noncurrent on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company currently does not have any deferred tax assets or liabilities on its balance sheet as a full valuation allowance has been reserved against them, and it does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-17 will have a material impact on its financial statements.

 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (“ASU No. 2016-02”), Leases. ASU 2016-02 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this new guidance prospectively in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its financial statements, and expects that it will increase our lease assets and correspondingly increase our lease liabilities.
     In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 (“ASU 2016-09”), Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. The new guidance requires any excess tax benefits (“windfalls”) and tax deficiencies (“shortfalls”) associated with vested or settled share-based awards to be recognized in the income statement rather than additional paid-in capital, which is to be applied prospectively. Further, windfalls will be required to be presented as an operating activity rather than as an outflow from operating activity and an inflow to financing activity, as required by the existing guidance. This new presentation guidance can be applied retrospectively or prospectively. The new guidance also eliminates the requirement to delay the recognition of windfalls until it begins to reduce current income taxes payable, and this is to be applied using the modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. In addition, ASU 2016-09 allows entities to withhold an amount up to the employees’ maximum individual tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction without having to account for the award as a liability-based award, and this guidance is to be applied using the modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. ASU 2016-09 also permits forfeitures to be either estimated, as required by the existing guidance, or recognized when they occur. The change in the accounting for forfeitures is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. The new guidance will be effective for public entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company plans to adopt this new guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and does not expect a material impact on its financial statements given the full valuation allowance position on its deferred tax assets.
     In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 (“ASU 2016-15”), Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (A Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to limit diversity in the classification of certain transactions in the statement of cash flows. Such transactions include (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon bonds, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from insurance claims settlement, (5) proceeds from settlement of life insurance policies, and (6) distributions of equity method investments. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-15 on its financial statements.
     In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18 (“ASU 2016-18”), Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The purpose of ASU 2016-18 is to eliminate the diversity in classifying and presenting changes in restricted cash in the statements of cash flows. The new guidance requires restricted cash to be combined with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending balances of cash on the statement of cash flows, thereby no longer requiring transactions such as transfers between restricted and unrestricted cash to be treated as a cash flow activity. Further, the new guidance requires the nature of the restrictions to be disclosed, as well as a reconciliation between the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows on how restricted and unrestricted cash are segregated. The new guidance will be effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the new guidance is expected to have on its financial statements.      
     3.    Fair Value Measurements
     The Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are comprised of investment assets that include money market and investments, a liability for convertible preferred stock warrants and a liability for common stock 

 
  104

 
warrants.  The Company’s Credit Line described in Note 8, is not measured at fair value on a recurring basis and is carried at amortized cost. The Company believes that the fair value of the Credit Line approximates its carrying value or amortized costs, due to the short-term nature of this obligation and the interest rate relative to market rates.
     The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities be carried at fair value and classified in one of the following three categories:
     Level I: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to access
     Level II: Observable market‑based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data, such as quoted prices, interest rates, and yield curves
     Level III: Inputs that are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data.
     This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. There were no transfers between Level I, Level II and Level III during the periods presented.
     Assets and Liabilities That Are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
     The following table represents the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

      The Company's warrants to purchase common stock are valued using Level III inputs; the Company used inputs from a Black-Scholes model with market volatility that is determined for comparable companies in the same business sector. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair value and are excluded from the table above. 
     In April 2013, the Company entered into a senior secured term loan with a third‑party lender, which consisted of a credit agreement, royalty agreement, warrants, and loan commitment. The Company considered the guidance under ASC 825‑10, Financial Instruments, which provides a measurement basis election for most financial instruments (i.e., either historical cost or fair value), allowing reporting entities to mitigate potential mismatches that arise under the current mixed measurement attribute model and ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures that provides for the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities, except for derivatives, for which the fair value is determined by ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
     The Company evaluated the components of the senior secured term loan and determined that they were derivatives to be evaluated under ASC 815‑15‑25‑1. The fair value accounting for derivatives is not an option, as derivatives must be fair valued under ASC 815 following the measurement guidance under ASC 820. Therefore, the Company engaged a third 

 
  105

 
party to determine the fair value of the derivatives using the guidance of ASC 820 and recorded the senior secured term loan at fair value.
     ASC 815 requires the terms and features of an instrument that are not a derivative itself to be evaluated for embedded derivatives that must be bifurcated and separately accounted for as freestanding derivatives, provided that certain criteria of ASC 815 are met. As a result of the Company's evaluation, it was indicated that the senior secured term loan constituted a liability with embedded derivative features, which were accounted for separately as mark-to-market instruments. As for the warrants that were granted with this senior secured term loan, it was determined that they were detachable and therefore a stand-alone component of the senior secured term loan which was to be fair valued using Level III inputs as a separate derivative. Determining the fair value of these instruments required significant judgment or estimation, and the Company utilized various techniques such as (i) discounted future cash flows, (ii) the income approach, using various revenue assumptions and applying a Monte-Carlo Simulation to each outcome and (iii) Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model with market volatility that was determined by comparison to comparable companies in the same business sector. The fair value of both the senior secured term loan and warrants was re-measured at the end of each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded within non-operating expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. In October 2015, the Company repaid the entire borrowings under the senior secured term loan.
     The following table provides a roll forward of the fair value, as determined by Level III inputs, of the warrants for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

Warrants | $ | 3,792 | | Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model | | Volatility | | | 61.3 | %

      Warrants
     The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value of warrants are derived from the Company's common stock valuation that is based upon a model with inputs from a Black-Scholes model and market volatility that is determined for comparable companies in the same business sector. The inherent risk in the market volatility is the selection of 

 
  106

 
companies with similar business attributes to the Company. The Company changed the volatility assumption from a group of 15 companies that was shared with the secured debt volatility prior periods to a group of four companies that is shared with the volatility used for stock-based compensation. The Company determined this was appropriate as the secured debt was settled in October 2015 and results in consistent volatility assumptions used for both common stock warrants and stock-based compensation. This resulted in an increase of the Company’s warrant valuation of $0.1 million on December 31, 2016.
     4. Financial Instruments
     The Company elected to invest a portion of its cash assets in conservative, income earning, liquid investments effective September 2015. Cash equivalents and investments, all of which are classified as available-for-sale securities, consisted of the following:
 | December 31, 2016 | | December 31, 2015 |

      The Company invests in U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency and high quality municipal bonds which mature at par and are all paying their coupons on schedule. Thus, the Company has determined there is currently no other than temporary impairment of our investments, and will continue to recognize unrealized losses and gains in other comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had $0.2 million in realized gains and immaterial realized losses for a total net realized gain of $0.2 million as a result of the sale of investments. There was no sale of investments for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
     As of December 31, 2016, the Company has 27 investments in an unrealized loss position in its portfolio. Available-for-sale debt securities that were in a continuous loss position but were not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired were immaterial as of December 31, 2016. The Company earned interest income of $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes the Company’s portfolio of available-for-sale securities by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2016:

Total Property and equipment, net | | $ | 32,289 | | $ | 12,710 

      All of the Company’s long-lived assets are located in the United States.
     In September 2015, the Company paid off the Equipment Financing Facility, thus none of the Company's equipment is subject to pledge.
     The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets when events or circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the estimated realizable value of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined based on the estimated realizable value of the long-lived asset.
     The Company recorded asset impairment charges totaling $2.1 million in cost of product, licensing and other revenues in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2016 following its impairment analysis on certain sequencing and automation equipment whose service lives were determined to be significantly shorter than initially expected. Total impairment charge of $2.1 million also included the write-off of $0.3 million unamortized maintenance service contract prepayments related to the impaired equipment described above. Those equipment were phased out in January 2017 as the Company began its transition to the next generation of sequencing and automation equipment to help streamline its production workflows. Another impairment charge of $0.2 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss to write off the carrying value of an equipment that was not actively used in production. 

 
  108

 

     The Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $1.0 million against a specific group of machinery and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company no longer uses this specific group of machinery and equipment because of outsourcing to its partners. The impairment charge was recorded to reflect reductions in the estimated realizable value of the machinery and equipment as a result of planning for its sale in the secondary market. The Company recorded the total impairment charge of $1.0 million in cost of product, licensing and other revenues. The Company sold some of the impaired machinery and equipment during the fourth quarter of 2015 for $0.5 million and classified the remaining impaired machinery and equipment as held for sale at the estimated realizable value of $0.2 million. The remaining impaired machinery was sold in January 2016 for $0.2 million. 
     Other Assets
     In April 2016, the Company entered into a four-year agreement with an insurance carrier whereby in return for partial exclusivity and the right to pricing benefits the Company paid total consideration of $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2016, $2.6 million in deferred costs was included in other assets. The deferred costs are being amortized ratably over the four-year term of the agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company has amortized $0.6 million of the deferred costs, which was recorded as a reduction of product revenues in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.     Accrued Compensation

 6. Commitments and Contingencies
     Operating Leases 
     As of December 31, 2016, the Company sub‑leases office facilities under non‑cancelable operating lease agreements. The Company occupies approximately 88,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at our corporate headquarters in San Carlos, California pursuant to two separate subleases. One sublease covers approximately 61,000 square feet (the “First Space”), and the other sublease covers approximately 27,000 square feet (the “Second Space”). In connection with the sublease for the First Space in January 2013 and the Second Space in March 2014, the Company executed two letters of credit in favor of the lessors for $0.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
     In October 2016, the Company amended the lease agreement that it directly entered into with the landlord of our First Space and Second Space (as described above) to include a sublease of additional office space to accommodate its growth and consolidate its operations in California at one location. The additional sublease covers approximately 48,000 square feet of office space and consists of two phases. The first phase began in October 2016 and covers approximately 16,000 square feet of office space at a base rent of $60,730 per month. The second phase began in January 2017, which covers approximately 32,000 square feet of office space at a base rent of $121,460 per month. The term of this sublease is approximately eighty-four months, with the same expiration date as the First Space and Second Space, which is in October 2023.
     In April 2015, the Company entered into a sub-lease agreement for additional office space in Redwood City, California. The additional space carried a base rent of $0.1 million per month. The lease period began in June 2015 and terminated in August 2016 with no option to extend the lease. In addition, the Company paid a security deposit of $0.1 million.
     In September 2015, the Company’s subsidiary entered into a long-term lease agreement for laboratory and office space totaling approximately 94,000 square feet in Austin, Texas. The lease term is 132 months beginning in December 2015 with monthly payments beginning in December 2016, increasing from $0.1 million to $0.2 million. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, the subsidiary has paid a security deposit of $0.4 million, and the landlord has allotted the subsidiary an allowance for leasehold improvements of up to $7.8 million. As of December 31, 2016, a total of $5.4 million of the allowance has been reimbursed by the landlord.
     The future annual minimum lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2016 are as follows:

      Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $5.4 million, $2.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The Company is also required to pay its share of facility operating expenses with respect to the facilities in which it operates.
     Legal Proceedings
     From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. The Company is aggressively defending its current litigation matters, and while there can be no assurances and the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company currently believes that there are no existing claims or proceedings that are 

 
  110

 
likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other third-party claims against the Company may cause the Company to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges.
     In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require the Company to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If this were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company's estimates, if any, which could result in the need to record or adjust a liability and record additional expenses. During the periods presented, the Company has not recorded any accrual for loss contingencies associated with such legal proceedings, determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable or reasonably possible, or determined that the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable.
     On each of February 17, 2016, March 10, 2016, March 28, 2016 and April 4, 2016, purported class action lawsuits were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Mateo (the “San Mateo Superior Court”), against the Company, its directors and certain of its officers and 5% stockholders and their affiliates, and each of the underwriters of the Company’s July 1, 2015 initial public offering (the "IPO"). The complaints assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The complaints allege, among other things, that the Registration Statement and Prospectus for the Company’s IPO contained materially false or misleading statements, and/or omitted material information that was required to be disclosed, about the Company’s business and prospects. Among other relief, the complaints seek class certification, unspecified compensatory damages, rescission, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Company removed these actions to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and the actions were subsequently remanded back to the San Mateo Superior Court. The Company has appealed the remand and moved to stay, or put a hold on, discovery pending the appeal. The Company has also filed a demurrer, or a request for dismissal as a matter of law, in the San Mateo Superior Court, which has not yet been heard. The Company intends to defend the matter vigorously, but cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate outcome or that an adverse resolution would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. In light of, among other things, the early stage of the litigations, the Company is unable to predict the outcome and is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome.
     On March 4, 2016, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Diego, by a patient alleging that Natera failed to perform a test that was ordered. The complaint seeks compensatory damages. This matter is in the discovery stage. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims in this lawsuit, and assert any counterclaims that may be available to it. The Company cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate outcome or that an adverse resolution of this lawsuit would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. In light of, among other things, the early stage of the litigation, the Company is unable to predict the outcome and is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome.
     On December 12, 2015, the Company received a civil investigative demand from the United States Department of Justice in connection with what the Company understands to be a qui tam action related to the billing of some of its testing, brought by a former employee. The Company has produced documents in response to the demand. An adverse ruling in this proceeding could require the Company to pay treble damages, civil penalties, and attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company has only received a civil investigative demand and has not been served with a complaint; accordingly, the Company is unable to predict the outcome and is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from an unfavorable outcome.
     On December 9, 2016, the Company filed a lawsuit against Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc. (“Bio-Reference”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Bio-Reference breached a licensing and joint development agreement (the “Licensing Agreement”) between Bio-Reference and Natera, misappropriated trade secrets, and converted confidential information. The Company also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction enjoining Bio-Reference from launching a nationwide marketing campaign of its product in violation of the Licensing Agreement. On December 10, 2016, the Company’s motion for a temporary restraining order was denied, and 

 
  111

 
the Court ordered both parties to submit proposed hearing dates with respect to our motion for a preliminary injunction. The Company and Bio-Reference have resolved the matter as of February 2017.
     Director and Officer Indemnifications
     As permitted under Delaware law, and as set forth in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and its Bylaws, the Company indemnifies its directors, executive officers, other officers, employees and other agents for certain events or occurrences that may arise while in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under this indemnification is unlimited; however, the Company has insurance policies that may limit its exposure and may enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, the Company believes any obligations under this indemnification would not be material, other than an initial $1.5 million for securities related claims an $0.3 million for commercial general liability claims. However, no assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case the Company may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations.      Third-Party Payer Reimbursement Audits 
     In November 2014, a third-party payer sought information as part of an investigative audit of claims which it had paid for certain genetic testing. The Company complied with their request and provided responsive information. In a letter dated June 2, 2015, the third-party payer alleged that it had overpaid $1.9 million to the Company, which it claimed was an overpayment reflecting the difference between what it paid to the Company and what it contended it should have paid based on its fee schedule and coverage determinations. In August 2015, the Company reached an agreement for a settlement payment of $1.2 million as part of a complete settlement of this matter. This charge was recorded against revenue in the second quarter of 2015.
     In March 2017, a third-party payer alleged that it had overpaid the Company, and has demanded recoupment of the alleged overpayments. The Company disagrees with the contentions.
     Contractual Commitments
     As of December 31, 2016, the Company has non‑cancelable contractual commitments with a supplier for approximately $5.1 million and other material supplier commitments for approximately $3.4 million for inventory material used in the laboratory testing process.        As of December 31, 2016, the Company has a non-cancelable license agreement with a vendor for approximately $3.0 million. This represents binding and remaining commitments with the vendor through December 31, 2019.
         7. Stock‑Based Compensation
     Equity Plans
     2015 Equity Incentive Plan
     General.    The Company’s board of directors adopted its 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Plan, in June 2015. The Company’s 2015 Plan replaced its 2007 Stock Plan. However, awards outstanding under the 2007 Plan will continue to be governed by the terms of the 2007 plan.
     Share Reserve.    The initial number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance under the 2015 Plan was 3,451,495 shares. As of December 31, 2016, 13,094,869 shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2015 plan, which includes unissued and forfeited shares from the 2007 plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance 

 
  112

 
under the 2015 Plan will be increased automatically on the first business day of each of our fiscal years, commencing in 2016, by a number equal to the smallest of:
    
· | 3,500,000 shares;
--+------------------


· | 4% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last business day of the prior fiscal year; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the number of shares determined by our board of directors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

      Stock options vest as determined by the compensation committee. In general, they will vest over a four-year period following the date of grant. Stock options expire at the time determined by the compensation committee but in no event more than ten years after they are granted. These awards generally expire earlier if the participant's service terminates earlier. 
     Restricted Shares and Stock Units. Restricted shares and stock units may be awarded under the 2015 Plan in return for any lawful consideration, and participant who receive restricted shares or stock units generally are not required to pay cash for their awards. In general, these awards will be subject to vesting. Vesting may be based on length of service, the attainment of performance-based milestones or a combination of both, as determined by the compensation committee. 
     2007 Stock Plan
     General. The Company’s board of directors adopted its 2007 Plan in January 2007, and it was approved by the Company’s stockholders. No further awards have been made under the 2007 Plan after July 1, 2015, the date of the Company’s initial public offering; however, awards outstanding under our 2007 Plan will continue to be governed by their existing terms.
     Share Reserve.    As of December 31, 2016, the Company reserved 7,713,510 shares of its common stock for issuance under the 2007 Plan, all of which may be issued as incentive stock options. As of December 31, 2016, options to purchase 6,098,564 shares of common stock, at exercise prices ranging from $0.0978 to $12.8501 per share, or a weighted-average exercise price of $2.71 per share, were outstanding under the 2007 Plan.
     Options vest as determined by the administrator. In general, the Company granted options that vest over a four-year period following the date of grant. In most cases, options granted prior to 2011 (and prior to 2012 with respect to the Company’s executive officers) were immediately exercisable, subject to the Company’s right to repurchase unvested shares. Options expire at the time determined by the administrator, but in no event more than ten years after they were granted, and generally expire earlier if the optionee's service terminates earlier.
     Restricted Shares. Restricted shares could be awarded or sold under the 2007 Plan in return for cash or cash equivalents or, as permitted by the administrator in its sole discretion, in exchange for services rendered to the Company, by delivery of a full-recourse promissory note or through any other means permitted by applicable law. Restricted shares vest as determined by the administrator.
     2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
     General.    The Company’s 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, was adopted by its board of directors in June 2015 and its stockholders approved it in June 2015. The 2015 ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
     Share Reserve. The Company has reserved 893,548 shares of its common stock for issuance under the 2015 ESPP. As of December 31, 2016, 1,056,344 shares were available for issuance under the 2015 plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 ESPP will automatically be increased on the first business day of each of the Company’s fiscal years, commencing in 2016, by a number equal to the least of:
    
· | 880,000 shares;
--+----------------

 
 
  113

 

    
· | 1% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last business day of the prior fiscal year; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the number of shares determined by our board of directors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

      The number of shares reserved under the 2015 ESPP will automatically be adjusted in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or a reverse stock split (including an adjustment to the per-purchase period share limit).
     Offering Periods. Each offering period will last a number of months determined by the compensation committee, not to exceed 27 months. A new offering period will begin periodically, as determined by the compensation committee. Offering periods may overlap or may be consecutive. Unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee, two offering periods of six months' duration will begin in each year on May 1 and November 1. 
     The first offering period started on December 15, 2015 and ended on April 30, 2016, and 116,215 shares were purchased at the end of this offering period for a total proceeds of $1.0 million. The second offering period started on May 1, 2016 and ended on October 31, 2016, and 224,637 shares were purchased at the end of this offering period for a total proceeds of $1.6 million.
     Purchase Price. The price of each share of common stock purchased under our 2015 ESPP will not be less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value per share of common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period (or, in the case of the first offering period, the price at which one share of common stock is offered to the public in this offering) or the fair market value per share of common stock on the purchase date.
     Early Exercise of Employee Options 
     As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 1.3 million exercised and unvested shares outstanding that are subject to a repurchase right held by the Company at the original issuance price in the event that the optionee’s employment is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Effective in the year ended December 31, 2015, pursuant to the agreements with the option holders, the Company changed its estimated expiration of its repurchase right for 1.3 million exercised and unvested shares outstanding that are subject to repurchase right held by it through the 210 days after the date of the prospectus filed in connection with the Company’s IPO. Accordingly, the unrecognized compensation expense is being accelerated over a shorter performance period through January 2016. As a result of this acceleration, the Company recorded an additional $1.3 million in stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2015.

 Stock‑Based Compensation Expense
     Employee and non‑employee stock‑based compensation expense was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
     The following table presents the effect of employee and non‑employee stock‑based compensation expense on selected statements of operations line items for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
    
 | Year ended December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 
 | Employee | | Non-Employee | | Total | Employee | | Non-Employee | | Total | Employee | | Non-Employee | | Total

          As of December 31, 2016, approximately $19.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to unvested awards will be recognized over a weighted‑average period of approximately 2.8 years.
     Valuation of Stock Option Grants to Employees
     The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options granted to employees on the grant date using the Black‑Scholes option‑pricing model. The fair value of employee stock options is amortized on a straight‑line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, generally the vesting period. The fair value of employee stock options was estimated using the following assumptions:
 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014 | 
Expected term | 5.1 | | — | 5.2 | | 5.6 | | — | 10.0 | | 4.9 — 7.1 | 
Expected volatility | 62.2 | % | — | 72.5 | % | 69.7 | % | — | 78.8 | % | 73.4 | % | — | 87.0 | %
Expected dividend rate | | | | 0 | % | | | | 0 | % | | | | 0 | %
Risk-free interest rate | 0.97 | % | — | 1.92 | % | 1.56 | % | — | 2.32 | % | 1.65 | % | — | 2.04 | %

      Expected Term:    The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. For granted "at-the-money" stock options, the Company estimated the expected term by using the simplified method up until December 31, 2015, which involved calculating the average of the time-to-vesting and the total contractual life of the options. Starting January 1, 2016, the Company uses a different approach by calculating the average of—(1) its employees’ historical stock options exercise behavior, and (2) the weighted-average of the time-to-vesting and the total contractual life of the options. For stock options that are not granted "at-the-money," the Company uses the binomial lattice model to calculate the expected term. 
     Expected Volatility:    The Company derived the expected volatility from the average historical volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies within its peer group over a period approximately equal to the expected term. 
     Expected Dividend Rate:    The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future. 
     Risk-Free Interest Rate:    The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U. S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term.

 Valuation of Stock Option Grants to Non-Employees 
     Total options outstanding as of December 31, 2016, include 141,046 shares of option awards that were granted to non-employees, of which 10,456 shares are unvested. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options granted to non-employees is recognized as the stock option is earned and the services are rendered. The Company believes that the estimated fair value of the stock options is more readily measurable than the fair value of the services rendered. The fair value of the stock options granted to non-employees is calculated at each reporting date using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model with the following assumptions: 
    
 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014 | 
Expected term | 2.7 | | — | 3.2 | | 4.9 | | — | 9.8 | | 4.4 — 10.0 | 
Expected volatility | 50.9 | % | — | 72.6 | % | 70.2 | % | — | 75.4 | % | 71.9 | % | — | 80.2 | %
Expected dividend rate | | | | 0 | % | | | | 0 | % | | | | 0 | %
Risk-free interest rate | 0.68 | % | — | 1.38 | % | 1.74 | % | — | 2.24 | % | 1.41 | % | — | 2.61 | %

                  8.   Debt
     Senior Secured Term Loan 
     In April 2013, as amended in June 2014, the Company entered into a senior secured term loan arrangement (the "Secured Loan Arrangement") with ROS Acquisition LP ("ROS"). The Secured Loan Arrangement provided for up to $40.0 million in borrowing capacity ("Credit Agreement"), a warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock, and an agreement to pay royalties on Company revenues ("Royalty Agreement"). The Company borrowed $20.0 million on the effective date of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provided for an interest rate equal to the greater of (a) LIBOR or (b) 1% per annum plus the applicable margin of 8% per annum or 9% floor on the outstanding balance of the term loan. The Royalty Agreement obligated the Company to make royalty payments of 1% applied to total Company fiscal year revenues of up to $50.0 million and 1.5% applied to fiscal year incremental revenues above $50.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred approximately $1.4 million and $7.1 million in interest expenses under the Credit Agreement and royalty expenses under the Royalty Agreement, respectively. The $7.1 million in royalty expense included $1.8 million in royalty due and the remainder was for part of the $28.0 million pay-off to ROS.  Please refer to paragraph below for pay-off details. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred approximately $1.8 million and $2.2 million in interest expenses under the Credit Agreement and royalty expenses under the Royalty Agreement, respectively. The interest on the loan is set forth in the financial statements as interest expense below loss from operations. The effective yield was approximately 20.9% and 19.8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, excluding royalty and interest early termination payments. Under the terms of the Secured Loan Arrangement, the Company issued ROS a warrant to purchase 376,691 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $2.3229 per share. The Credit Agreement principal was due and payable on April 18, 2019. The Company could at its option, prepay the term loan borrowings subject to a prepayment premium equivalent to 10% of the outstanding principal. Prepayment of the amount due under the Credit Agreement did not eliminate the royalty payment obligation, which if not terminated, would have expired no later than April 18, 2023. 
     In October 2015, the Company made a payment of $28.0 million to ROS to extinguish the amounts owed, which included the principal and royalty obligation. This terminated the term loan, royalty and all associated liens securing the Credit Agreement.
     Credit Line Agreement
     In September 2015, the Company entered into the Credit Line with UBS providing for a $50.0 million revolving line of credit which can be drawn down in increments at any time.  In October 2015, the Company borrowed $32.0 million against the Credit Line, primarily to prepay all outstanding amounts under the Secured Loan Arrangement with ROS. The Credit Line bears interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 0.65%, and equals approximately 0.84% per annum at the time of the draw.  In November, 2015, the Company borrowed an additional $10.0 million which bears interest at approximately 0.85% per annum. Interest of $0.1 million was accrued during the year ended December 31, 2015. In June 2016, the Company borrowed an additional $8.0 million from the Credit Line and repaid $1.0 million, thereby resulting in a remaining $0.4 

 
  117

 
million available for draw down, net of accrued interest of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2016.  The outstanding balance of the Credit Line, including accrued interest, was $49.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The Credit Line is secured by a first priority lien and security interest in the Company’s money market and marketable securities held in its managed investment account with UBS. UBS has the right to demand full or partial payment of the Credit Line Obligations and terminate the Credit Line, in its discretion and without cause, at any time.
     Equipment Financing Facility 
     In April 2013, the Company entered into an equipment financing facility (the “Equipment Financing Facility”) with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company could borrow up to $5.0 million to fund equipment purchases. The financial institution maintained a security interest in the underlying equipment until payment in full of the loan. The loan bore interest at the financial institution's prime reference rate (defined as the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 2.50%) plus 4.10%, which equaled 7.35% upon closing of the agreement. In December 2014, the Company amended the Equipment Financing Facility increasing the loan amount to $5.9 million to fund equipment purchased. The Company paid interest on the unpaid principal at the financial institution's prime reference rate plus 3.10%, which equaled 6.35%. Under the terms of the Equipment Financing Facility, the loan would mature on May 31, 2017. Under the terms of the Equipment Financing Facility, the Company would be required to make 30 payments of principal and interest through the maturity of the loan in May 2017. 
     In September 2015, the Company paid off the remaining principal balance of the equipment financing facility.  The Company made a payment of $4.1 million, comprising of principal, interest and administrative fees settling all of its obligations under the loan.
     9. Warrants
     In 2007, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 24,538 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0978 per share to various holders. As of December 31, 2016, these warrants were fully exercised.
     In 2009, the Company granted warrants to purchase 33,742 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.8908 per share. The warrants were granted to a financial institution in connection with a secured equipment loan and expire on November 2, 2019. In connection with the IPO in July 2015, these warrants were converted into the right to purchase common stock at a one-to-one ratio. In December 2015, the financial institution net-exercised all 33,742 of their warrant shares at the strike price of $1.8908 per share.  Based on the Company’s closing price of $11.57 per share on the prior business day, the Company issued 28,227 shares to the financial institution.
     In April 2014, the Company granted warrants to purchase approximately 376,691 warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of $2.3229 per common share. The warrants were granted to ROS Acquisition Offshore LP in connection with the Company’s senior secured term loan and expire on April 18, 2023. It was determined that the warrants granted are detachable and therefore are a stand-alone component of the senior secured term loan to be fair valued using Level III inputs as a separate derivative.  As of December 31, 2016, these warrants remained exercisable for common stock.
     In connection with the Series F financing, the Series E preferred stockholders agreed to change the liquidation preference from two times to one times the liquidation value as described in the agreement. In exchange, on November 20, 2014, the Company issued common stock warrants to the Series E preferred stockholders to purchase 429,440 shares at $0.0163 per share. The warrants are carried in Additional Paid In Capital and the issuance of the warrants was treated as a deemed dividend by the common stockholder out of Additional Paid in Capital. In connection with the IPO in July 2015, such warrants were automatically net exercised into 429,042 shares of common stock. 
     10.    Convertible Preferred Stock 
     At the closing of the IPO in July 2015, 31,397,221 shares of outstanding convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into common stock on a one-to-one basis. Following the IPO, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. In connection with the IPO, the Company amended and restated its Amended and Restated Certificate 

 
  118

 
of Incorporation to change the authorized capital stock to 750.0 million shares designated as common stock and 50.0 million shares designated as preferred stock, all with a par value of $0.0001 per share.
     As of December 31, 2014, the convertible preferred stock consisted of the following:
    
 | Shares | Shares Issued and | Liquidation | | Proceeds, net of | 
Series | Authorized | Outstanding | Amount | | Issuance Costs | 
 | (in thousands)
A-1 | 5,000 | 3,067 | $ | 20 | | $ | 20

          11. Common Stock
     The Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as restated in connection with the closing of the IPO, authorizes the Company to issue 750.0 million shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had 52.7 million and 50.3 million shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. Each shareholder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. 
     The Company's board of directors and stockholders approved an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-1.63 reverse split of its capital stock, which was effected on June 19, 2015. All references to common stock, options to purchase common stock, restricted stock, share data, per share data, warrants, convertible preferred stock and related information have been retroactively adjusted where applicable in this report to reflect the reverse stock split of the Company's capital stock as if it had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
     12. Income Taxes 
     The Company's effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate as follows: 
    
 | December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 
 | (in thousands, except percentages) | 
U.S. federal taxes (benefit) at statutory rate | $ | (32,277) | (34.0) | % | $ | (24,375) | (34.00) | %
State tax expense | | (2,842) | (2.99) | % | | (2,428) | (3.39) | %
Research and development credits | | (1,449) | (1.53) | % | | (751) | (1.05) | %
Stock-based compensation | | 1,275 | 1.34 | % | | 1,683 | 2.35 | %
Mark to market fair value adjustments | | 49 | 0.05 | % | | 504 | 0.70 | %
Other nondeductible items | | 933 | 0.99 | % | | 841 | 1.17 | %
Change in valuation allowance | | 34,453 | 36.29 | % | | 24,526 | 34.21 | %
Provision for income taxes | $ | 142 | 0.15 | % | $ | — | — | %

      Due to its history of operating losses, the Company has not recorded any income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, with the exception of $142,000 of foreign withholding tax in 2016. As the provision for income taxes was not significant for and the year ended December 31, 2015, any income taxes were reclassified in other income and expenses.

     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The components of the net deferred income tax assets are as follows:
    
 | December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 
 | (in thousands) | 
Deferred tax assets | | | | | 
Net operating loss carryforwards | $ | 68,504 | | $ | 41,451 
Research and development tax credit carryforwards | | 8,634 | | | 4,794 
Reserves and accruals | | 5,719 | | | 3,108 
Stock-based compensation | | 3,220 | | | 2,206 
Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance | | 86,077 | | | 51,559 
Less: valuation allowance | | (85,606) | | | (51,153)
 | | 471 | | | 406 
Deferred tax liabilities | | | | | 
Property and equipment | | (471) | | | (406) 
Net deferred tax assets | $ | — | | $ | — 

      The Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in 2016 and 2015 due to the uncertainty surrounding realization of these assets. The valuation allowance increased by $34.5 million, $24.5 million and $0.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
     As of December 31, 2016, the Company had federal and state net operating loss (“NOLs”) carryforwards of approximately $205.3 million and $109.6 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2027 and 2017, respectively, if not utilized. The deferred tax assets related to NOLs do not include excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. Equity will be increased by $7.2 million, if and when such deferred tax assets are ultimately realized. The Company uses ASC 740 ordering when determining when excess tax benefits have been realized. The Company also had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $8.5 million, which begin to expire in 2027, and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $5.8 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. Realization of these deferred tax assets would require $226.2 million in taxable income to fully utilize. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards. 
     Federal and California tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOLs and credit carryforwards in the event of an "ownership change" for tax purpose, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the Company's ability to utilize these carryforwards may be limited as the result of such ownership change. Such a limitation could result in limitation in the use of the NOLs in future years and possibly a reduction of the NOLs available. 
     A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 
    
 | December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 
 | (in thousands) | 
Balance at beginning of year | $ | 2,405 | | $ | 1,360
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year | | 1,836 | | | 1,045
Additions for tax positions of prior years | | 52 | | | — 
Balance at end of year | $ | 4,293 | | $ | 2,405

      The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2009. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased $1.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, due to additional research and development credits generated during the year. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $4.3 million and $2.4 million, 

 
  120

 
respectively. The reversal of the uncertain tax benefits would not affect the Company's effective tax rate to the extent that it continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
     The Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and to income taxes in various states in the United States. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations, and require significant judgment to apply. The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for all prior tax years since incorporation. The Company does not anticipate significant changes to its current uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2017.
     The Company recognizes any interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.  As of December 31, 2016, there were no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
         13. Related‑Party Transactions 
     The Company entered into a full recourse promissory note with the Company’s chief executive officer, in April 2012 whereby the Company loaned Dr. Rabinowitz $154,000. This interest only loan bore interest at a rate per annum of 1.15%, compounded annually. This loan, including all accrued interest, was repaid in full by Dr. Rabinowitz in May 2015. 
     The Company entered into a full recourse promissory note with Jonathan Sheena, the Company’s chief technology officer, in April 2012 whereby the Company loaned Mr. Sheena $38,280. This interest only loan bore interest at a rate per annum of 1.15%, compounded annually. This loan, including all accrued interest, was repaid in full by Mr. Sheena in May 2015.
     14. Net Loss per Share
     Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Prior to the Company’s IPO of its common stock, the Company’s convertible preferred stock was entitled to receive dividends, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on common stock and thereafter participate pro rata on an as converted basis with the common stock holders on any distributions to common stockholders. The convertible preferred shares were therefore considered to be participating securities. As a result, the Company calculated the net loss per share using the two-class method. Accordingly, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is derived from the net loss for the period and, in periods in which the Company has net income attributable to common stockholders, an adjustment is made for the noncumulative dividends and allocations of earnings to participating securities based on their outstanding shareholder rights. Under the two-class method, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to the convertible preferred stock as the convertible preferred stock did not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses. The diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. In periods when the Company has incurred a net loss, convertible preferred stock, options to purchase common stock, common stock warrants and common stock subject to repurchase are considered common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as their effect is antidilutive.

              17.    Subsequent Events
     In January 2017, the Company amended an existing agreement with one of its vendors to revise its minimum purchase commitments of gene sequencing tests in exchange for certain additional rights under the agreement. The revised minimum purchase commitments amount to $3.6 million for 2017. For 2018, the minimum purchase commitments total $4.5 million. If the Company fails to meet its minimum purchase commitments in 2018, there is no financial consequence, but it would lose certain exclusivity rights under the agreement.
