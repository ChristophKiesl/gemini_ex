Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a dedicated contract development and manufacturing organization, or CDMO, solving complex formulation and manufacturing challenges for companies developing oral solid dose drug products. We leverage our formulation and development expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using proprietary delivery technologies and know-how for partners who develop and commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. In 2020, we launched our clinical trials support services capabilities, which includes preparation of clinical trial supplies, as well as specialized services dedicated to the development and Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, of high-potency products. We operate a 97,000 square foot, DEA-licensed manufacturing facility in Gainesville, Georgia, as well as a 24,000 square foot development, high-potency product and clinical packaging facility in Gainesville, Georgia that we opened in October 2018. We currently develop and/or manufacture the following key products with our key commercial partners: Ritalin LA®, Focalin XR®, Verelan PM®, Verelan SR®, Verapamil PM and Verapamil SR, as well as supporting development stage products. 
 Our manufacturing and development capabilities include formulation, product development from formulation through clinical trial and commercial manufacturing, and specialized capabilities for solid oral dosage forms, extended release and controlled substance manufacturing, as well as high potency development and manufacturing. In a typical collaboration, we work with our partners to develop product candidates, or new formulations of existing product candidates, and may license certain intellectual property to such partners. We also typically exclusively manufacture and supply clinical and commercial supplies of these proprietary products and product candidates. 
 Our Strategy
 The CDMO market is large and growing and is expected to continue to expand as outsourced penetration is seen due to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies outsourcing more of their operations. We believe companies, which include our customers and prospective customers, generally prefer fewer, higher quality suppliers with specialized expertise in addressing their formulation and manufacturing challenges early in the development cycle. Our strategy for growth in this market includes:

• | Expand Existing Customer Relationships. We maintain strong customer relationships with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with established and stable pharmaceutical products. Our development-stage business also provides us the opportunity to provide services through the lifecycle of a product. Approximately 90% of our development customers have signed additional proposals for extension work, such as next step development proposals or additional batches. We view this repeat work as indicative of the level of confidence our existing customers have in our technical ability and reliable execution. We believe this pattern indicates potential for future growth and plan to leverage our current relationships for new business opportunities moving forward.

• | Diversify Our Customer Base. We have taken, and continue to take, steps to diversify and expand our customer base. Over the last several years, we have increased our focus on business development, hired subject matter experts and established additional systems and processes to expand our offering of development-stage services to attract new customers. In 2020 we launched new clinical trial support services, or CTS, capabilities, and we launched a significant new commercial product tech transfer project. This strategy has resulted in adding 16 new customers over the past two years, and we expect to further expand our business with new customers in 2021.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Integrated Full-Service Development and Manufacturing Facilities. We believe pharmaceutical companies generally prefer to engage with CDMOs that are able to work with a product throughout its lifecycle and have experienced a reliable track record of regulatory compliance and quality control first-hand. Our early-stage development and high-potency business feeds clinical and commercial manufacturing opportunities to our manufacturing business. We believe that by providing customers with a broad range of services from benchtop through commercial launch and supply, we can best support the needs of our customers throughout the lifecycle of their products. We provide fully-integrated and customized biomanufacturing services that support our customers from the early preclinical stage through commercial launch and supply. Our services are all supported by modern facilities designed to meet customer needs from early stage development to commercial supply.

Agreements with Key Commercial Partners
 Teva
 We are party to a License and Supply Agreement with Watson Laboratories, Inc., a subsidiary of Teva, or the Teva Agreement, pursuant to which we are the exclusive supplier of Verapamil SR to Teva. We own the NDA for Verapamil SR and, pursuant to the Teva Agreement, have granted Teva an exclusive license to commercialize and sell Verapamil SR in the United States.  The Teva Agreement expires on December 31, 2024, after which it will renew for additional one-year periods unless terminated by either party. Under the Teva Agreement, Teva pays us a share of profits on sales of Verapamil SR.
Lannett
 We are party to a License and Supply Agreement with Kremers Urban Pharmaceutical, Inc., a subsidiary of Lannett, or the Lannett Agreement, pursuant to which we supply Verelan PM and SR and Verapamil PM to Lannett. We own the new drug application, or NDA, related to Verelan and license commercialization rights to Lannett under the Lannett Agreement. The Lannett Agreement expires on December 31, 2024 and will renew thereafter for successive two-year periods. Under the Lannett Agreement, Lannett pays us a share of profits on sales of Verelan PM and SR and Verapamil PM. Lannett additionally pays us an annual license fee of $500,000 and, beginning in 2021, is obligated to reimburse to us 50% of the Prescription Drug User Act program fees associated with Verelan. 
Novartis
 We are party to a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Novartis, or the Novartis Agreement, pursuant to which we continued our long-standing relationship with Novartis as the exclusive global supplier to Novartis of Ritalin LA and Focalin XR capsules until December 31, 2023. The Novartis Agreement will renew automatically thereafter for successive one-year periods unless terminated by either party at least 24 months prior to December 31, 2023, or any subsequent one-year term thereafter. Novartis may terminate the Agreement immediately if (i) any governmental regulatory authority prevents Novartis from supplying the active pharmaceutical ingredients in the products and/or exporting, purchasing or selling the products; (ii) any product cannot be reasonably commercialized for medical, scientific or legal reasons; or (iii) we fail to comply with certain health, safety and environmental protection requirements. After the December 31, 2023, Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement upon 12 months’ written notice in the event of any sale or divestment by us of our business or assets relating to the products.
Permits and Regulatory Approvals
 We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities where we manufacture products or where our customers’ products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with cGMPs, labeling and distribution, import and export, and product registration and listing. As a result, our facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions.
 We hold various licenses and registrations for our manufacturing activities. The primary licenses and registrations held are FDA Registrations of Drug Establishments and DEA Controlled Substance Registration. Due to certain U.S. state law requirements, we also hold certain state licenses for distribution activities throughout certain states. We also hold cGMP certifications for EU importation of products made in Gainesville for sale in the EU and an ANVISA certification for sale in Brazil. Compliance with these licensing and regulatory requirements is a key aspect of our business and, if there are changes in the regulations applicable to our business in the United States or other jurisdictions, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards or pay additional fees. This may require a change in our manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities.
 In certain of our commercial partnerships, our commercial partner is the product authorization holder for products that have been developed on behalf of the commercial partner. In other commercial partnerships, we are the authorization holder. When our commercial partner holds the relevant authorization from the FDA or other national regulator, we support this authorization by furnishing a letter of reference to the Drug Master File, or the chemistry, manufacturing and related data to the relevant regulator or sponsor to provide adequate manufacturing support in respect of the product. We generally update this information annually with the relevant regulator.
 We hold the approved NDAs for Verelan SR and Verelan PM, which we license to Lannett and Teva, respectively. Verapamil SR and Verapamil PM are authorized generics.

Environmental and Safety Matters
 Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic or hazardous material. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emissions, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities.  
 Prevailing legislation tend to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.
 Intellectual Property
 We own several issued patents in the United States and several foreign patent applications for abuse resistant pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use related to Zohydro ER®, which provide patent protection through 2034, subject to any extensions or disclaimers. Although certain patents may have expired or may expire in the future, we believe there are other barriers to entry for our commercial partners and competition, including ownership of regulatory filings, NDAs, abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, and drug master files, or DMFs, manufacturing trade secrets, proprietary dosage strengths, pricing limitations in various geographies, costs to revalidate with another supplier, maturity and life-cycle stage of products. We have acquired and developed and continue to acquire and develop knowledge and expertise and trade secrets in the provision of formulation, process development and manufacturing services. We intend to rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality agreements and license agreements, to protect our proprietary know-how.
Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our current and future competitors include pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. 
 We compete with contract pharmaceutical formulation and manufacturing companies such as Adare Pharma Solutions, Avara Pharmaceutical Services, Metrics Contract Services, Pharmaceutics International and Quotient Sciences, as well as other formulation, development and manufacture-related service providers.
 Government Regulation
 Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, distribution, marketing, export and import of prescription drugs, such as those we are developing and manufacturing. Any drug products developed or manufactured by us are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, which impose procedural and documentation requirements. The FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facilities are not able to demonstrate compliance with GMPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections (i.e., compliance with filed submissions) or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with GMP and other regulations. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of product approval,  recall or seizure of the product or other voluntary, FDA‑initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further operations.

The Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, added new sections to the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, that require manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, and third-party logistics providers to take steps to identify and trace certain prescription drugs to protect against the threats of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful drugs in the supply chain. Among other mandates, the DSCSA requires manufacturers and repackagers to affix or imprint a unique product identifier (comprised of a standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product) on certain prescription drug packages in both a human-readable and on a machine-readable data carrier. The standardized numerical identifier is comprised of the product’s corresponding National Drug Code combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number. A drug product is misbranded if it does not bear the product identifier as required by Section 582 of the FD&C Act. Section 582 also established several requirements relating to the verification of product identifiers. 
 Certain products that we manufacture are regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered and enforced by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control and handling of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule.
 The DEA regulates controlled substances by controlling them in five schedules. Schedule I and II controlled substances have a high potential for abuse, whereas Schedule III-V controlled substances have relatively decreasing potential for abuse. Therefore, the DEA imposes more stringent controls on Schedule I and II substances than Schedule III-V substances, including stricter security controls, quotas, and increased recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Certain of the products we manufacture and/or develop are regulated as Schedule II controlled substances. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much certain controlled substances that we manufacture may be produced in total in the United States, based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce any Schedule II substance. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. In April 2018, the DEA proposed new guidelines aimed at strengthening the process for setting controls over diversion of controlled substances and making other improvements in the quota managements regulatory system for the production, manufacturing and procurement of controlled substances. Following a public comment period, the DEA published the final guidelines, which were substantially similar to the proposed guidelines, in July 2018. For 2019, the DEA proposed decreased manufacturing quotas for the six most frequently misused opioids, including hydrocodone, which we use in the manufacture of certain products, by an average of 10% as compared to the 2018 quotas. The DEA has proposed further decreasing manufacturing quotas in 2020 for five of the six opioids, including hydrocodone, by an average of 28%. Together with reductions in morphine, this is a 53% decrease since 2016. In October 2019, the DEA proposed additional regulations to amend the manner in which the agency grants quotas to manufacturers. The proposed regulations will establish use-specific quotas, including commercial sales, product development, transfer, replacement, and packaging. To decrease the risk of diversion and increase accountability, inventory allowances will be reduced, and procurement quota certifications will be required. In April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the DEA adjusted the established 2020 aggregate production quotas and assessment of annual needs for select Schedule II substances. The DEA took this action to ensure that the country has an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances during the public health emergency.
 The DEA requires facilities that manufacture controlled substances to adhere to certain security requirements. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances and periodic reports must be made to the DEA, for example, distribution, acquisition, and inventory reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance and suspicious orders. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
 The DEA requires drug manufacturers to design and implement a system that identifies suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as those of unusual size, those that deviate substantially from a normal pattern and those of unusual frequency, prior to completion of the sale. A compliant suspicious order monitoring, or SOM, system includes well-defined due diligence, “know your customer” efforts and order monitoring.

To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We are subject to state regulation of distribution for these products. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly where noncompliance results in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations, or take other enforcement action. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal prosecution.
 In addition to DEA regulations, the U.S. government and state legislatures have enacted legislation and regulations intended to fight the opioid epidemic. In February 2016, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid epidemic, which is part of a broader initiative led by the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the release of a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, FDA’s requirement of enhanced warnings and safety labeling, and institution of a class-wide REMs as a condition of approval. Further, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, was passed in 2016. CARA provides resources to improve state monitoring of controlled substances, including opioids. A Senate bill introduced in February 2018, known as CARA 2.0, would further limit initial prescriptions for opioids to three days, while exempting initial prescriptions for chronic care, cancer care, hospice or end of life care, and palliative care. CARA 2.0 would also increase civil and criminal penalties for opioid manufacturers that fail to report suspicious orders for opioids or fail to maintain effective controls against diversion of opioids. More recently, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, or Support Act, has been enacted. It provides for further regulation as well as funding for research and development of non-addictive painkillers. State legislatures have followed in the footsteps of the federal government in passing similar laws intended to limit prescription sales and quantities as well as increase the ability to monitor and regulate the manufacture and sale of opioids.
