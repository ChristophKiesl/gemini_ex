BUSINESS
 Our Company
 Emerald is a leading operator of business-to-business trade shows in the United States. Leveraging our shows as key market-driven platforms, we combine—within and around our events—a broad array of industry insights, digital tools, and data-focused solutions to create uniquely rich experiences for our customers. We have been recognized with many awards and accolades that reflect our industry leadership as well as the importance of our shows to the exhibitors and attendees we serve. 
 Our trade show franchises typically hold market-leading positions within their respective industry verticals, with significant brand value established over a long period of time. Each of our shows is typically held at least annually, with certain franchises offering multiple editions per year. As our shows are frequently the largest and most well attended in their respective industry verticals, we are able to attract high-quality attendees, including those who have the authority to make purchasing decisions on the spot or subsequent to the show. The participation of these qualified attendees makes our trade shows compelling events for our exhibitors, further reinforcing the leading positions of our trade shows within their respective industry verticals. Our attendees use our shows to fulfill procurement needs, source new suppliers, reconnect with existing suppliers, identify trends, learn about new products and network with industry peers, which we believe are factors that make our shows difficult to replace. Our portfolio of trade shows is well-balanced and diversified across both industry sectors and customers. The scale and qualified attendance at our trade shows translates into an exceptional value proposition for participants, resulting in a self-reinforcing “network effect” whereby the participation of high-value attendees and exhibitors drives high participant loyalty and predictable, recurring revenue streams.
 In addition to organizing our trade shows, conferences and other events, we also operate content and content-marketing websites and related digital products, and produce publications, each of which is aligned with a specific event sector. We also offer B2B ecommerce and digital merchandising solutions, serving the needs of manufacturers and retailers, through our recently-acquired Elastic Suite platform. In addition to their respective revenues, these products support our live events by delivering year-round channels for customer acquisition and development.       
 Our History 
 In June 2013, certain investment funds managed by an affiliate of Onex Corporation (such funds, collectively with Onex Partners V LP, “Onex”) acquired our business from an affiliate of Nielsen Holdings N.V. (the “Onex Acquisition”). We have since focused on expanding our portfolio of leading events organically, complemented by an increased focus on acquisitions. Since the Onex Acquisition, we have acquired and integrated 20 industry-leading, high-quality events and complementary businesses of various sizes for aggregate consideration of approximately $716 million.
 In June 2020, we entered into an investment agreement with Onex Partners V LP  (“Onex Partners V”), pursuant to which we agreed to issue to Onex Partners V, in a private placement transaction, 47,058,332 shares of our Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock ( the “Series A Preferred Stock”)  for a purchase price of $5.60 per share (the “Series A Price per Share”), for which we received aggregate proceeds of approximately $252.0 million, net of fees and estimated expenses of $11.6 million. In conjunction with the investment agreement with Onex Partners V, we announced a rights offering to holders of our outstanding common stock of one non-transferable subscription right for each share of our common stock held, with each right entitling the holder to purchase one share of Series A Preferred Stock at the Series A Price per Share, backstopped by Onex Partners V (the “Onex Backstop”).  The rights offering was completed in July of 2020. We received net proceeds of approximately $9.7 million from this rights offering. Pursuant to the Onex Backstop, on August 13, 2020, an additional 22,660,587 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were sold to Onex in exchange for proceeds of approximately $121.3 million, net of fees and expenses of $5.6 million.

As of December 31, 2020, Onex owned 47,058,332 shares of our common stock, representing 65.2% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, after giving effect to the Onex Backstop Onex owned 69,718,919 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, representing 161,891,916 shares of our common stock on an as-converted basis, after accounting for the accumulated accreting return at a rate per annum equal to 7% on the accreted liquidation preference and paid in-kind. Onex’s beneficial ownership of our common stock, on an as-converted basis, is approximately 85.6%.
 In 2020, we completed two acquisitions. In December, we acquired EDspaces, the education industry’s primary conference and event focused on the future of learning environments.
 On December 31, 2020, we acquired PlumRiver Technologies (“PlumRiver”), an international provider of software-as-a-service technology through its Elastic Suite platform. Elastic Suite’s platform streamlines the wholesale buying process for both brands and retail buyers, creating a digital year-round transactional platform for use by Emerald’s customers. We believe this acquisition will accelerate Emerald’s strategy to provide 365-day-per-year engagement for its customer base regardless of location by expanding its digital commerce capabilities and providing its customers with transactional functionality, including enterprise-level integration to brands’ ERP systems, allowing customers to manage orders, real-time inventory, and product merchandising. PlumRiver is integrated with leading manufacturers and retailers across numerous industries, most notably in the outdoor, surf, cycling, footwear and sporting goods verticals, and is expected to complement Emerald’s portfolio of leading show brands including Outdoor Retailer and Surf Expo, among others. PlumRiver’s Elastic B2B platform bridges the gap between sellers’ order processing systems and allows brands to sell directly to their buyers using print-free digital product catalogs and merchandising technology, enabling brands to increase their efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and profitability. 
 Products and Services
 We operate leading trade shows in multiple attractive, fragmented industry sectors that represent significant portions of the U.S. economy and serve a large and diverse set of global exhibitors and attendees. This fragmentation of exhibitors and attendees is an especially important characteristic of the trade show industry. In markets characterized by diverse groups of buyers and sellers, trade shows offer a great opportunity for interaction between large numbers of participants on both sides of a potential transaction (a “many-to-many” environment) within a short period of time, thus enhancing the value delivered to all trade show participants. Further, the highly fragmented nature of our markets enhances the stability of our entire platform as the loss of any single exhibitor or attendee is unlikely to cause other exhibitors or attendees to derive less value from and cease participating in a show.
 We typically generate the significant majority of our revenue through the live events that we operate, with the remaining revenue generated by other marketing services, including digital media and print publications that complement our event properties in the industry sectors we serve. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences forced us to cancel or postpone a significant portion of our event calendar beginning in March 2020 through the end of the year and the first half of 2021. As a result, only 75% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was generated through in person events, and 25% from virtual events other marketing services. By contrast, we generated 92% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 through the live events that we operated. The remaining 8% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was generated from other marketing services. Each of our other marketing services products allows us to remain in close contact with, and market to, our existing event audiences throughout the year.
 Trade Shows & Other Events
 The following is a summary and example of several of our trade shows and other events by sector and a discussion of our complementary products.
 3


Retail
 Spanning a vast market of products, our retail experiences cover merchandising, licensing, sourcing, and marketing to enable professionals to shop intelligently, make informed decisions, and meet consumer demands. Buying customers are able to discover rare finds and big sellers in a complete marketplace of options, along with new brands, potential partners, and beneficial seminars across popular and profitable categories. Events produced in this category include:
 
 
☐ ASD Market Week (“ASD”) | ☐ JA New York 
☐ COUTURE | ☐ NY NOW 
☐ Impressions | ☐ Outdoor Retailer (“OR”) 
☐ International Pizza Expo | ☐ RetailX 

Design & Construction
 Our shows in the Design & Construction industry sector catering to the construction, hospitality, and interior design sectors serving the hotel, resort, retail, healthcare facilities, restaurant, bar, spa, and in-store marketing categories. Targeted attendees include interior designers, architects, owners and operators, developers, and specifiers and purchasers working within these industries. This sector is well-suited for trade shows because design and construction are highly visual and tactile processes, requiring the in-person experience and interaction provided by trade shows. By aggregating a wide range of products under one roof, these trade shows save time and expense for designers and other attendees who would otherwise have to independently visit hundreds of showrooms that may be located in different cities. Examples of our events produced in this category include:

☐ Boutique Design New York (“BDNY”) | ☐ Hospitality Design Expo (“HD Expo”) 
☐ Environments for Aging Expo & Conference (“EFA”) | ☐ ICFF (previously International Contemporary Furniture Fair) 
☐ Healthcare Design Expo & Conference | ☐ Kitchen & Bath Industry Show (“KBIS”) 

Technology
 With technology expanding at a rapid pace, professionals in every aspect of commerce—from engineering to electronics, and visual arts to security—must stay on top of the latest advancements to help them stay informed, efficient, and competitive. Our technology events provide experiences that connect businesses of all sizes with innovative products, operational strategies, and integration opportunities to drive new business, increased profits, and streamlined processes. Through exciting show floors, thought leadership, and networking events, decision-makers in these industries can thrive in the midst of digital progress and change. Some examples of our events produced in this category include:
 
 
☐ CEDIA Expo | ☐ Internet Retailer Conference & Exhibition (“IRCE”) 
☐ Digital Dealer | ☐ RFID Journal Live (“RFID Live”) 
☐ The International Drone Conference & Exposition (“InterDrone”) | ☐ Total Tech Summit

Equipment
 Our equipment experiences outfit aerospace, construction, industrial, medical, and hospitality professionals with the tools and resources necessary to operate, build, and repair structures, vehicles, and devices of every kind. These events and surrounding platforms serve as a marketplace featuring vendors and innovative products and services, as well as educational centers, supporting a wide array of industries. Examples of our events produced in this category include:
 
 
☐ The Hotel Experience (“HX”) | ☐ National Pavement Expo 
☐ International Fastener Expo | ☐ PhotoPlus Expo 
☐ Medtrade | ☐ Wedding & Portrait Photographers International (“WPPI”)

Examples of our events produced in this category include:

☐ Marine Military Expos | 

Other Marketing Services
 Other Marketing Services consist of print publications and digital media products that complement our trade show properties, which generated 20.6% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. These print and digital media products are closely aligned with several of our events across the portfolio categories, facilitating year-round customer contact, new customer generation and content marketing vehicles.  Some examples of these products are:

☐ Healthcare Design | ☐ Kitchen & Bath Business (“KBB”) 
☐ Hospitality Design | ☐ Pizza Today 
☐ Impressions ☐ PlumRiver | ☐ Retail TouchPoints 

Reportable Segments
 As described in Note 18, Segment Information, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the determination of our reportable segments is consistent with the information provided our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered the chief operating decision-maker ("CODM"). The CODM evaluates performance based on the results of six executive brand portfolios, which represent our six operating segments. Based on an evaluation of economic similarities and the nature of services and types of customers, four of these operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable segments, the Commerce reportable segment and the Design and Technology reportable segment. The remaining three operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds to be considered reportable segments and are included in the “All Other” category. In addition, we have a Corporate-Level Activities category consisting of finance, legal, information technology and administrative functions.

The following discussion provides additional detailed disclosure for the two reportable segments, the All Other category and the Corporate-Level Activity category:
 Commerce:  This segment includes events and services covering merchandising, licensing, retail sourcing and marketing to enable professionals to make informed decisions and meet consumer demands. 
 Design and Technology: This segment includes events and services that support a wide variety of industries connecting businesses and professionals with products, operational strategies, and integration opportunities to drive new business and streamline processes and creative solutions. 
 All Other: This category consists of Emerald’s remaining operating segments, which provide diverse events and services but are not aggregated with the reportable segments. Each of the operating segments in the All Other category represents less than 10% of consolidated revenue and does not meet the criteria to be a separate reportable segment.
 Corporate-Level Activity: This category consists of Emerald’s finance, legal, information technology and administrative functions. 
 Competition
 The trade show industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 9,400 B2B trade shows held per year in the United States according to the Center for Exhibition Industry Research, of which a majority are owned by industry associations, according to Advanced Market Research. Individual trade shows typically compete for attendees and exhibitors only against the other trade shows that are relevant to their industry vertical. The level of competition each of our trade shows faces therefore varies by industry vertical.  In addition, PlumRiver’s Elastic Suite platform competes with several other well-capitalized software-as-a-service technology platforms.
 Other well-established for-profit companies competing in the U.S. trade show industry include Reed Exhibitions, Informa Exhibitions and Clarion Events.
 Seasonality
 As is typical for the trade show industry, our business has historically been seasonal, with revenue recognized from trade shows typically reaching its highest level during the first quarter of each calendar year, and its trough during the fourth quarter, largely due to the timing of our trade shows. In 2019, 40%, 28%, 22% and 10% of our trade show revenue was generated during the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. In 2020, 98% of our trade show revenue was generated during the first quarter because substantially all of our in-person events were cancelled beginning in March 2020 and through December 31, 2020.
Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We undertake to strategically and proactively develop our intellectual property portfolio by registering our trademarks. We currently rely primarily on trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We do not own, but have a license to use, certain trademarks belonging to an industry association in connection with our Kitchen & Bath Industry Show and CEDIA Expo. The KBIS license runs through 2028 and the CEDIA Expo license continues in perpetuity.
Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 542 full-time employees. Our management team principally works from our New York City headquarters (60 employees) and our Southern California corporate offices (111 employees), with members of our sales team distributed throughout the United States, mainly near the geographic markets they serve.  In addition to our full-time resources, we also utilize staffing agencies to fill temporary staffing needs on an event-by-event basis.
 We are not involved in any disputes with our employees and believe that relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unions. However, some facilities where we hold our trade shows require our decorators to use unionized labor.

In order to protect our workforce from the outbreak of COVID-19, in March 2020 we transitioned substantially all of our employees to a remote/work-from-home arrangement. As of December 31, 2020, most of our employees continue to work remotely, and 13 employees remained furloughed. As we resume in-person events on a limited basis in markets where such events are permitted, we have prioritized the health and safety of exhibitors, attendees and our employees, taking extensive COVID protective measures. We consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success. As such, our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The growth and development of our workforce is an integral part of our success. We are also committed to developing and fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion and know that a company’s ultimate success is directly linked to its ability to identify and hire talented individuals from all backgrounds and perspectives. 
 To further these goals, we offer our employees:
  
• | Flexible work hours and time off to do their best work;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | A comprehensive welfare package that includes a wide variety of benefits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunities to build a solid financial foundation, including a 401k plan;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunities to give back in impactful ways through the Emerald Cares volunteer program; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On-the-job training, development opportunities, and quality experiences designed to help all Emerald team members elevate their knowledge, grow their skills, and further their careers.

Insurance
 We maintain insurance policies to cover the principal risks associated with our business, including event cancellation, business interruption, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, cyber security, product liability, auto, property, and umbrella and excess liability insurance. All of our insurance policies are with third-party carriers and syndicates with financial ratings of A or better. We believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business. Event cancellation insurance provides coverage that allows us to refund a proportionate share, relative to the compromised enforced attendance reduction or show closure, of the deposits and booth and sponsorship fees paid to us by exhibitors in the event that we are forced to cancel a trade show or other event for reasons covered by the policies, such as natural disasters, communicable disease, terrorism, or venue closures. Business interruption insurance provides further coverage for our office property leases in cases where we are not able to conduct ongoing business, including sales and event planning. The continued availability of appropriate insurance policies on commercially reasonable terms is important to our ability to operate our business and to maintain our reputation. 
 Further, Emerald maintains event cancellation insurance to protect against losses due to the unavoidable cancellation, postponement, relocation and enforced reduced attendance at events due to certain covered events. Specifically, Emerald is insured for losses due to event cancellations caused by the outbreak of communicable diseases, including COVID-19. In addition, coverage extends to include additional promotional and marketing expenses necessarily incurred by us should a covered loss occur. This insurance also includes a terrorism endorsement covering an act of terrorism and/or threat of terrorism directed at the insured event or within the United States or its territories.
 The aggregate limit under these event cancellation insurance policies is approximately $191.1 million in 2020 and $191.4 million in 2021 if losses arise for reasons within the scope of this policy. In addition to this primary policy, Emerald maintains a separate event cancellation insurance policy for the Surf Expo Summer 2020 and Surf Expo Winter 2021 shows, with a coverage limit of $6.0 million and $7.7 million, for each respective event. The Company is in the process of pursuing claims under these insurance policies to offset the financial impact of cancelled and postponed events as a result of COVID-19. As of December 31, 2020, we have received proceeds of $89.2 million in respect of claims filed under our event cancellation insurance policies. To date, we have submitted $167.4 million in claims for impacted or cancelled events previously scheduled to take place in 2020. There is no guarantee or assurance as to the amount or timing of future recoveries from Emerald’s event cancellation insurance policies.
