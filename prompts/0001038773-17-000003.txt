ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

SmartFinancial, Inc. (“SmartFinancial” the “Company”), formerly “Cornerstone Bancshares, Inc.,” was incorporated on September 19, 1983, under the laws of the State of Tennessee. SmartFinancial is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. On August 31, 2015, Cornerstone Bancshares, Inc. merged with SmartFinancial, Inc. (“Legacy SmartFinancial”), with Cornerstone Bancshares, Inc. surviving the merger and changing its name to “SmartFinancial, Inc.” Following the merger, the Company operated two wholly-owned subsidiaries: SmartBank and Cornerstone Community Bank, both Tennessee banking corporations (the “Banks”). On February 26, 2016, the company merged Cornerstone Community Bank with and into SmartBank, with SmartBank surviving the merger. As of the date of this annual report, SmartBank (the “Bank”) is our only subsidiary Bank.

SmartFinancial

The primary activity of SmartFinancial currently is, and is expected to remain for the foreseeable future, the ownership and operation of SmartBank. As a bank holding company, SmartFinancial intends to facilitate SmartBank’s ability to serve its customers’ requirements for financial services. The holding company structure also provides flexibility for expansion through the possible acquisition of other financial institutions and the provision of additional banking-related services, as well as certain non-banking services, which a traditional commercial bank may not provide under present laws.

The Merger
On August 31, 2015, we completed our merger with Legacy SmartFinancial valued at approximately $28.4 million. Legacy SmartFinancial was merged with and into Cornerstone Bancshares, with Cornerstone Bancshares continuing on as the surviving corporation, changing its name to SmartFinancial, Inc. and relocating the headquarters to Knoxville, Tennessee. The merger was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes. Following the merger, SmartBank and Cornerstone Community Bank continued to operate separately until February 26, 2016, when the two banks were merged together. In connection with the merger, Cornerstone Bancshares Inc. sold $15 million of common stock at $3.75 per share in a stock offering to accredited investors, and used the proceeds to redeem the Company’s Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock. As part of the merger, Cornerstone effected a 1-for-4 reverse stock split after which the Legacy SmartFinancial shareholders were issued 1.05 shares of Cornerstone common stock for each share of Legacy SmartFinancial common stock owned. All of Cornerstone’s outstanding stock options vested upon consummation of the merger. The merger gave us a material market presence in the Chattanooga, Tennessee-Georgia MSA and surrounding counties. Following the merger, SmartFinancial listed its common stock on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol “SMBK.”
SBLF Preferred Stock

On August 31, 2015, and in connection with the merger, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”) with Legacy SmartFinancial, pursuant to which Legacy SmartFinancial assigned to the Company, and the Company assumed, all of Legacy SmartFinancial’s rights, responsibilities, and obligations under that certain Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”), dated as of August 4, 2011, by and between The United States Secretary of the Treasury (“Treasury”) and Legacy SmartFinancial. The Securities Purchase Agreement was entered into by Legacy SmartFinancial in connection with its participation in Treasury’s Small Business Lending Fund Program.

Under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, Legacy SmartFinancial sold 12,000 shares of its Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (“Legacy SmartFinancial SBLF Stock”), to Treasury for a purchase price of $12 million. Each share of Legacy SmartFinancial SBLF Stock was converted into one share of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the “SBLF Preferred Stock”). More details about the SBLF Preferred Stock can be found in Note 16 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

SmartBank

SmartBank is a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank established in 2007 which has its principal executive offices in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The principal business of the Bank consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds, together with funds generated from operations and from principal and interest payments on loans, primarily in commercial loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, consumer loans and residential and commercial construction loans. Funds not 
4

invested in the loan portfolio are invested by the Bank primarily in obligations of the U.S. Government, U.S. Government agencies, and various states and their political subdivisions. In addition to deposits, sources of funds for the Bank’s loans and other investments include amortization and prepayment of loans, sales of loans or participations in loans, sales of its investment securities and borrowings from other financial institutions. The principal sources of income for the Bank are interest and fees collected on loans, fees collected on deposit accounts and interest and dividends collected on other investments. The principal expenses of the Bank are interest paid on deposits, employee compensation and benefits, office expenses and other overhead expenses.  At December 31, 2016, SmartBank had twelve full-service branches located in East Tennessee and the Florida Panhandle, two loan production offices, one mortgage loan production office, and two service centers.

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, SmartFinancial had 222 full-time equivalent employees and SmartBank had 219 full-time equivalent employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. SmartFinancial believes that its relationship with its employees is good.
Merger and Acquisition Strategy

Our strategic plan involves growing a high performing community bank through organic loan and deposit growth as well as disciplined merger and acquisition activity.  We are continually evaluating business combination opportunities and may conduct due diligence activities in connection with these opportunities. As a result, business combination discussions and, in some cases, negotiations, may take place, and transactions involving cash, debt or equity securities could be expected. Any future business combinations or series of business combinations that we might undertake may be material in terms of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, or equity issued.
Competition

The three Tennessee markets in which we currently operate are very competitive. The Knoxville MSA banking market consists of 48 financial institutions with over $16.2 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2016, up from $15.1 billion at June 30, 2015.  As of June 30, 2016, approximately 47.6 percent of this deposit base was controlled by three large, multi-state banks headquartered outside of Knoxville: First Horizon, SunTrust, and Regions Financial. At June 30, 2016, SmartBank had approximately 0.4 percent of the deposit market share in the Knoxville MSA. 
The Chattanooga MSA banking market consists of 27 financial institutions with over $9.3 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2016, up from $9.0 billion at June 30, 2015.  As of June 30, 2016, approximately 55.5 percent of this deposit base was controlled by three large, multi-state banks headquartered outside of Chattanooga: First Horizon, SunTrust, and Regions Financial.  At June 30, 2016, SmartBank had approximately 3.4 percent of the deposit market share in the Chattanooga MSA.

The Sevier County banking market, which is not in a MSA, is comprised of 10 financial institutions with over $2.2 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2016, up from $2.1 billion at June 30, 2015.  As of June 30, 2016, approximately 78.8 percent of this deposit base was controlled by four local community banks which are headquartered in the county. At June 30, 2016, SmartBank had approximately 19.4 percent of the deposit market share in Sevier County.
The two Florida markets in which we currently operate branches are very competitive. The Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent MSA banking market consists of 18 financial institutions with over $5.4 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2016, up from $5.1 billion at June 30, 2015.  As of June 30, 2016, approximately 65.8 percent of this deposit base was controlled by five large, multi-state banks headquartered outside of Pensacola: Regions, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Synovus Financial, and Hancock Holding Co.  At June 30, 2016, SmartBank had approximately 0.3 percent of the deposit market share in the Pensacola MSA. 
The Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin MSA banking market is comprised of 25 financial institutions with over $4.8 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2016, up from $4.6 billion at June 30, 2015.  As of June 30, 2016, approximately 43.1 percent of this deposit base was controlled by four large, multi-state banks headquartered outside of Pensacola: Regions, Synovus Financial, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.  At June 30, 2016, SmartBank had approximately 1.3 percent of the deposit market share in the Crestview MSA.

The Bank competes for deposits principally by offering depositors a variety of deposit programs with competitive interest rates, quality service and convenient locations and hours. The Bank focuses its resources in seeking out and attracting small business relationships and taking advantage of the Bank’s ability to provide flexible service that meets the needs of this customer class. Management feels this market niche is the most promising business area for the future growth of the Bank.

SUPERVISON AND REGULATION
General
The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. The following is a general summary of the material aspects of certain statutes and regulations applicable to SmartFinancial and SmartBank. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct and profitability of our activities. A change in applicable laws and regulations, or in the manner such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material effect on our business, operations and earnings. 
SmartFinancial is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHC Act. As a result, we are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve, and we are required to file with the Federal Reserve annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHC Act. SmartFinancial is required to file with the Federal Reserve annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHC Act and other applicable regulations. The Federal Reserve may also make examinations of SmartFinancial and its subsidiary. We are also under the jurisdiction of the SEC for matters relating to the offering and sale of our securities and are subject to the SEC’s rules and regulations relating to periodic reporting, reporting to shareholders, proxy solicitations, and insider-trading regulations.
SmartBank is a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a Tennessee bank, SmartBank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the TDFI. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, SmartBank is also subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. In addition, SmartBank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, and SmartBank is subject to regulation by the FDIC as the insurer of its deposits.
The bank and bank holding company regulatory scheme has two primary goals: to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. This comprehensive system of supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, bank depositors and the public, rather than our shareholders or creditors. To this end, federal and state banking laws and regulations control, among other things, the types of activities in which we and SmartBank may engage, permissible investments that we and SmartBank may make, the level of reserves that SmartBank must maintain against deposits, minimum equity capital levels, the nature and amount of collateral required for loans, maximum interest rates that can be charged, the manner and amount of the dividends that may be paid, and corporate activities regarding mergers, acquisitions and the establishment and closing of branch offices. In addition, federal and state laws impose substantial requirements on SmartBank in the areas of consumer protection and detection and reporting of potential or suspected money laundering and terrorist financing.

The description below summarizes certain elements of the bank regulatory framework applicable to us and SmartBank. This summary is not, however, intended to describe all laws, regulations and policies applicable to us and SmartBank, and you should refer to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and corresponding guidance for more information. These statutes and regulations are subject to change, and additional statutes, regulations, and corresponding guidance may be adopted. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal level. We are unable to predict these future changes or the effects, if any, that these changes could have on our business, revenues, and financial results.
Regulation of SmartFinancial 
As a regulated bank holding company, we are subject to various laws and regulations that affect our business. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, limit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, restrict our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles, among other things. 
Permitted activities
Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company, as discussed below, is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than five percent of any class of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and that is engaged in, the following activities (in each case, subject to certain conditions and restrictions and prior approval of the Federal Reserve):

6


• | banking or managing or controlling banks;


• | furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries; and


• | any activity that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, including, for example factoring accounts receivable, making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities, leasing personal or real property, operating a nonbank depository institution, such as a savings association, performing trust company functions, conducting financial and investment advisory activities, underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments, performing selected insurance underwriting activities, issuing and selling money orders and similar consumer-type payment instruments, and engaging in certain community development activities.


While the Federal Reserve has found these activities in the past acceptable for other bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve may not allow us to conduct any or all of these activities, which are reviewed by the Federal Reserve on a case by case basis upon application by a bank holding company.
Acquisitions subject to prior regulatory approval
The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for a bank holding company to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank or to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of any class of the voting shares of any bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company or savings association, or to increase any such non-majority ownership or control of any bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company or savings association, or to merge or consolidate with any bank holding company.
Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company that is located in Tennessee and is “well capitalized” and “well managed”, as such terms are defined under the BHC Act and implementing regulations, may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee. In each case, however, restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in concentrations of deposits exceeding limits specified by statute. 
Federal and state laws, including the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, impose additional prior notice or approval requirements and ongoing regulatory requirements on any investor that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or bank holding company. “Control” of a depository institution is a facts and circumstances analysis, but generally an investor is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities. Ownership or control of 10 percent or more of any class of voting securities, where either the depository institution or company is a public company, as we are, or no other person will own or control a greater percentage of that class of voting securities after the acquisition, is also presumed to result in the investor controlling the depository institution or other company, although this is subject to rebuttal.
The BHC Act was substantially amended through the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, commonly referred to as the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, or the GLBA. The GLBA eliminated long-standing barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies and other financial services providers. A bank holding company whose subsidiary deposit institutions are “well capitalized” and “well managed” may elect to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage without prior Federal Reserve approval in certain banking and non-banking activities that are deemed to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activity. These “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; organizing, sponsoring and managing mutual funds; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. No regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve. We have not elected to become a financial holding company. 
A dominant theme of the GLBA is functional regulation of financial services, with the primary regulator of a company or its subsidiaries being the agency which traditionally regulates the activity in which the aompany or its subsidiaries wish to engage. For example, the SEC will regulate bank holding company securities transactions, and the various banking regulators will oversee banking activities.
Bank holding company obligations to bank subsidiaries
Under current law and Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its depository institution subsidiaries and to maintain resources adequate to support such subsidiaries, which could 
7

require us to commit resources to support SmartBank in situations where additional investments may not otherwise be warranted. As a result of these obligations, a bank holding company may be required to contribute additional capital to its subsidiaries.
Bank holding company dividends
The Federal Reserve’s policy regarding dividends is that a bank holding company should not declare or pay a cash dividend which would impose undue pressure on the capital of any bank subsidiary or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements that might adversely affect a bank holding company’s financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if:

• | its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;


• | its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or


• | it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.

Should an insured member bank controlled by a bank holding company be “significantly undercapitalized” under the applicable federal bank capital ratios, or if the bank subsidiary is “undercapitalized” and has failed to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or has materially failed to implement such a plan, the Federal Reserve may require prior approval for any capital distribution by the bank holding company. For more information, see “Capitalization levels and prompt corrective action” below.
In addition, since our legal entity is separate and distinct from SmartBank and does not conduct stand-alone operations, our ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of SmartBank to pay dividends to us, which is also subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in “Bank dividends.”
Under Tennessee law, we are not permitted to pay cash dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. 

Dodd-Frank Act
On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act has imposed new restrictions on and expanded regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions like SmartBank. Although the Dodd-Frank Act is primarily aimed at the activities of investment banks and large commercial banks, many of the provisions of the legislation impact operations of community banks like SmartBank. In addition to the Volcker Rule, which is discussed in more detail below, the following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to our operations: 

• | Tier 1 capital treatment for “hybrid” capital items like trust preferred securities is eliminated, subject to various grandfathering and transition rules.


• | The deposit insurance assessment base calculation now equals the depository institution’s average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period. Previously, the deposit insurance assessment was calculated based on the insured deposits held by the institution.


• | The ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund was removed and the minimum designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased 20 basis points to 1.35 percent of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base. The FDIC also was directed to “offset the effect” of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.


• | Bank holding companies and banks must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” in order to acquire banks located outside of their home state, which codified long-standing Federal Reserve policy. Any bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company must be and remain “well capitalized” and “well managed.”


• | Capital requirements for insured depository institutions are now countercyclical, such that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction.


• | The Federal Reserve established interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions under a restrictive “reasonable and proportional cost” per transaction standard.


• | The “opt in” provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1997 have been eliminated, which allows state banks to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank’s home state if the law of such other state would permit a bank chartered in that state to open a branch at that location.


• | The Durbin Amendment limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions for financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. While the Durbin Amendment does not directly apply to SmartBank, competitive

8

market forces related to the reduction mandated by the Durbin Amendment may result in a decrease in revenue from interchange fees for smaller financial institutions.

• | The prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposit accounts was repealed effective one year after enactment, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business checking and other accounts.


• | A new federal agency was created, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB is also responsible for examining large financial institutions (i.e., those with more than $10 billion in assets) and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial protection.


• | The regulation of consumer protections regarding mortgage originations, addressing loan originator compensation, minimum repayment standards including restrictions on variable-rate lending by requiring the ability to repay be determined based on the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable-rate loan term, prepayment consideration, and new disclosures, has been expanded.


The foregoing provisions may have the consequence of increasing our expenses, decreasing our revenues and changing the activities in which we choose to engage. The environment in which banking organizations will now operate, including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible activities, corporate governance and compensation, changes in fiscal policy and steps to eliminate government support for banking organizations, may have long-term effects on the profitability of banking organizations that cannot now be foreseen. The ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time.
The Volcker Rule 
On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators as well as the SEC each adopted a final rule implementing Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” Generally speaking, the final rule prohibits a bank and its affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring certain “covered funds” or from acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in such covered funds. Most private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds are considered “covered funds” as are bank trust preferred collateralized debt obligations. The final rule required banking entities to divest disallowed securities by July 21, 2015, subject to extension upon application. The Volcker Rule did not impact any of our activities nor do we hold any securities that we were required to sell under the rule, but it does limit the scope of permissible activities in which we might engage in the future.
U.S. Basel III capital rules 
The U.S. Basel III capital rules, effective January 1, 2015, apply to all national and state banks and savings associations and most bank holding companies, which we collectively refer to herein as “covered banking organizations.” The requirements in the U.S. Basel III capital rules started to phase in on January 1, 2015, for many covered banking organizations, including SmartFinancial and SmartBank. The requirements in the U.S. Basel III capital rules will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.
The U.S. Basel III capital rules impose higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the rules impose the following minimum capital requirements:

• | a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent;


• | a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 percent (increased from the then-current 4 percent requirement);


• | a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent (unchanged from the then-current requirements);


• | a leverage ratio of 4 percent; and


• | a new supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, resulting in a leverage ratio requirement of 7 percent for such institutions.

Under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, or CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock.
The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total consolidated assets, such as us, to continue to include trust-preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not in CET1 capital, subject to certain restrictions. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. 
9

In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital, and total capital). The capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and will consist of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.
The U.S. Basel III capital standards require certain deductions from or adjustments to capital. As a result, deductions from CET1 capital will be required for goodwill (net of associated deferred tax liabilities); intangible assets such as non-mortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships (net of associated deferred tax liabilities); deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (net of any related valuations allowances and net of deferred tax liabilities); any gain on sale in connection with a securitization exposure; any defined benefit pension fund net asset (net of any associated deferred tax liabilities) held by a bank holding company (this provision does not apply to a bank or savings association); the aggregate amount of outstanding equity investments (including retained earnings) in financial subsidiaries; and identified losses. Other deductions will be necessary from different levels of capital. The U.S. Basel III capital rules also increase the risk weight for certain assets, meaning that more capital must be held against such assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150 percent rather than the 100 percent that was the case prior to these rules becoming effective.
Additionally, the U.S. Basel III capital standards provide for the deduction of three categories of assets: (i) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks (net of related valuation allowances and of deferred tax liabilities), (ii) mortgage servicing assets (net of associated deferred tax liabilities) and (iii) investments in more than 10 percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions (net of associated deferred tax liabilities). The amount in each category that exceeds 10 percent of CET1 capital must be deducted from CET1 capital. The remaining, non-deducted amounts are then aggregated, and the amount by which this total amount exceeds 15 percent of CET1 capital must be deducted from CET1 capital. Amounts of minority investments in consolidated subsidiaries that exceed certain limits and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions may also have to be deducted from the category of capital to which such instruments belong.
Accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. The U.S. Basel III capital rules provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We elected to opt out. The rules also have the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, mortgage servicing rights not includable in CET1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, which are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the U.S. Basel III capital rules will require us and SmartBank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 percent, plus the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 7 percent, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 percent, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 percent, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 percent, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5 percent and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes that we and SmartBank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the U.S. Basel III capital rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective.
The U.S. Basel III capital rules also make important changes to the “prompt corrective action” framework discussed below in “Regulation of SmartBank-Capitalization levels and prompt corrective action.”
Anti-tying restrictions. 
Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other nonbanking services offered by a bank holding company or its affiliates.
Executive compensation and corporate governance
The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to include, at least once every three years, a separate non-binding “say on pay” vote in their proxy statement by which shareholders may vote on the compensation of the public company’s named executive officers. In addition, if such public companies are involved in a merger, acquisition, or consolidation, or if they propose to sell or 
10

dispose of all or substantially all of their assets, shareholders have a right to an advisory vote on any golden parachute arrangements in connection with such transaction (frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” vote). Other provisions of the act may impact our corporate governance. For instance, the act requires the SEC to adopt rules prohibiting the listing of any equity security of a company that does not have an independent compensation committee; and requiring all exchange-traded companies to adopt clawback policies for incentive compensation paid to executive officers in the event of accounting restatements based on material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements.
Regulation of SmartBank
As a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank, SmartBank is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the TDFI, and, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, SmartBank is also subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve. Federal and state law and regulation affect virtually all of SmartBank’s activities including capital requirements, the ability to pay dividends, mergers and acquisitions, limitations on the amount that can be loaned to a single borrower and related interests, permissible investments, and geographic and new product expansion, among other things. SmartBank must submit an application to, and receive the approval of, the TDFI and Federal Reserve before opening a new branch office or merging with another financial institution. The Commissioner of the TDFI and the Federal Reserve have the authority to enforce laws and regulations by ordering SmartBank or a director, officer, or employee of SmartBank to cease and desist from violating a law or regulation or from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices and by imposing other sanctions including civil money penalties.

Tennessee law contains limitations on the interest rates that may be charged on various types of loans and restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be granted and on the type of investments which may be made. The operations of banks are also affected by various consumer laws and regulations, including those relating to equal credit opportunity and regulation of consumer lending practices. SmartBank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

State banks are subject to regulation by the TDFI with regard to capital requirements and the payment of dividends. Tennessee has adopted the provisions of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation O with respect to restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit to bank “insiders.” Further, under Tennessee law, state banks are prohibited from lending to any one person, firm, or corporation amounts more than 15 percent of the bank’s equity capital accounts, except (i) in the case of certain loans secured by negotiable title documents covering readily marketable nonperishable staples, or (ii) with the prior approval of the bank’s board of directors or finance committee (however titled), the bank may make a loan to any person, firm or corporation of up to 25 percent of its equity capital accounts. 
Various state and federal consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of SmartBank, including state usury laws, consumer credit and equal credit opportunity laws, and fair credit reporting. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, generally prohibits insured state chartered institutions from conducting activities as principal that are not permitted for national banks.
Capitalization levels and prompt corrective action
Federal law and regulations establish a capital-based regulatory scheme designed to promote early intervention for troubled banks and require the FDIC to choose the least expensive resolution of bank failures. The capital-based regulatory framework contains five categories of regulatory capital requirements, including “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” To qualify as a “well capitalized” institution for these purposes, a bank must have a leverage ratio of no less than 5 percent, a Tier 1 capital ratio of no less than 6 percent, and a total risk-based capital ratio of no less than 10 percent, and a bank must not be under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level. 
Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDIA, which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. Bank holding companies controlling financial institutions can be called upon to boost the institutions’ capital and to partially guarantee the institutions’ performance under their capital restoration plans. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; (iv) requiring the institution to change and improve its management; (iv) prohibiting the 
11

acceptance of deposits from correspondent banks; (v) requiring prior Federal Reserve approval for any capital distribution by a bank holding company controlling the institution; and (vi) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions.
Notably, the thresholds for each of the five categories for regulatory capital requirements were revised pursuant to the U.S. Basel III capital rules. See the discussion under the heading “U.S. Basel III capital rules” above. Under these rules, which started to phase in on January 1, 2015, a well-capitalized insured depository institution is one (i) having a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 percent or greater, (ii) having a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent or greater, (iii) having a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5 percent or greater, (iv) having a leverage capital ratio of 5 percent or greater and (v) that is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. A state member bank is considered “adequately capitalized” if it has a leverage ratio of at least 4 percent, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent or better, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent and does not meet the definition of a well-capitalized bank.
It should be noted that the minimum ratios referred to above in this section are merely guidelines, and the bank regulators possess the discretionary authority to require higher capital ratios.
Bank reserves
The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions, even if not members of the Federal Reserve System, to maintain reserves against some transaction accounts (primarily negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) and Super NOW checking accounts). The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements. An institution may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank “discount window” as a secondary source of funds, provided that the institution meets the Federal Reserve Bank’s credit standards.
Bank dividends
The Federal Reserve prohibits any distribution that would result in the bank being “undercapitalized” (<4 percent leverage ratio, <4.5 percent CET1 capital ratio, <6 percent Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, or <8 percent total risk-based capital ratio). Tennessee law places restrictions on the declaration of dividends by state chartered banks to their shareholders, including, but not limited to, that the board of directors of a Tennessee-chartered bank may only make a dividend from the surplus profits arising from the business of the bank, and may not declare dividends in any calendar year that exceeds the total of its retained net income of that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years without the prior approval of the commissioner of the TDFI. Tennessee laws regulating banks require certain charges against and transfers from an institution’s undivided profits account before undivided profits can be made available for the payment of dividends. Furthermore, the TDFI also has authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a Tennessee bank when it determines such payment to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

Insurance of accounts and other assessments
SmartBank pays deposit insurance assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is determined through a risk-based assessment system. SmartBank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. SmartBank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the FDIC assigns an institution to a risk category based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations, which are designed to measure risk. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement or condition imposed by the FDIC.
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, a federal government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019.
Restrictions on transactions with affiliates
SmartBank is also subject to federal laws that restrict certain transactions between it and its nonbank affiliates. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank, including in the case of SmartBank, SmartFinancial. Under sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, or FRA, and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W, covered transactions by SmartBank with a single nonbank affiliate are generally limited to 10 percent of SmartBank’s capital and surplus and 20 percent of capital and surplus for all covered transactions with all nonbank affiliates. The definition of “covered 
12

transactions” includes transactions like a loan by a bank to an affiliate, an investment by a bank in an affiliate, or a purchase by a bank of assets from an affiliate. A loan by a bank to a nonbank affiliate must be secured by collateral valued at 100 percent to 130 percent of the loan amount, depending on the type of collateral and certain low quality assets and any securities of an affiliate may not serve as collateral. 
All such transactions must generally be consistent with safe and sound banking practices and must be on terms that are no less favorable to the bank than those that would be available from nonaffiliated third parties. Moreover, state banking laws impose restrictions on affiliate transactions similar to those imposed by federal law. Federal Reserve policies also forbid the payment by bank subsidiaries of management fees which are unreasonable in amount or exceed the fair market value of the services rendered or, if no market exists, actual costs plus a reasonable profit.
Loans to insiders
Loans to executive officers, directors or to any person who directly or indirectly, or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls or has the power to vote more than 10 percent of any class of voting securities of a bank, or to any related interest of those persons, including any company controlled by that person, are subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and their corresponding regulations, which is referred to as Regulation O. Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those prevailing on transactions made to unaffiliated individuals and certain extensions of credit to those persons must first be approved in advance by a disinterested majority of the entire board of directors. Regulation O prohibits loans to any of those individuals where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15 percent of an institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(g) identifies limited circumstances in which the bank is permitted to extend credit to executive officers.
Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, and its corresponding regulations are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. These regulations provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of its service area. Federal banking agencies are required to make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. The federal banking agencies consider a bank’s CRA rating when a bank submits an application to establish banking centers, merge, or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of all banks involved in the merger or acquisition are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other financial holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay, block or impose conditions on the transaction. SmartBank received a satisfactory rating on its most recent CRA assessment.
Branching
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, or Riegle-Neal Act, provides that adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies are permitted to acquire banks in any state. Previously, under the Riegle-Neal Act, a bank’s ability to branch into a particular state was largely dependent upon whether the state “opted in” to de novo interstate branching. Many states did not “opt-in,” which resulted in branching restrictions in those states. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Riegle-Neal legal framework for interstate branching to permit national banks and state banks to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state. Under current Tennessee law, our bank may open branch offices throughout Tennessee with the prior approval of the TDFI. All branching remains subject to applicable regulatory approval and adherence to applicable legal requirements.
Bank Secrecy Act
The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, better known as the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, requires all United States financial institutions to assist United States government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, BSA requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding a daily aggregate amount of $10,000, and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities.

Anti-money laundering and economic sanctions
The USA PATRIOT Act provides the federal government with additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act imposed new requirements that obligate financial institutions, such as banks, to take certain steps to control the risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing.
Among other requirements, the USA PATRIOT Act and implementing regulations require banks to establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at a minimum:

• | internal policies, procedures and controls designed to implement and maintain the bank's compliance with all of the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, the BSA and related laws and regulations;


• | systems and procedures for monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions and activities;


• | designated compliance officer;


• | employee training;


• | an independent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program;


• | procedures to verify the identity of each customer upon the opening of accounts; and


• | heightened due diligence policies, procedures and controls applicable to certain foreign accounts and relationships.

Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act requires each financial institution to develop a customer identification program, or CIP, as part of the bank's anti-money laundering program. The key components of the CIP are identification, verification, government list comparison, notice and record retention. The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the true identity and anticipated account activity of each customer. To make this determination, among other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from customers at the time they enter into the customer relationship with the financial institution. This information must be verified within a reasonable time through documentary and non-documentary methods. Furthermore, all customers must be screened against any CIP-related government lists of known or suspected terrorists. Financial institutions are also required to comply with various reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC consider an applicant's effectiveness in combating money laundering, among other factors, in connection with an application to approve a bank merger or acquisition of control of a bank or bank holding company.
Likewise, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with the subjects of U.S. sanctions, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. Currently, OFAC administers and enforces comprehensive U.S. economic sanctions programs against certain specified countries/regions. In addition to the country/region-wide sanctions programs, OFAC also administers complete embargoes against individuals and entities identified on OFAC's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or SDN List. The SDN List includes over 7,000 parties that are located in many jurisdictions throughout the world, including in the United States and Europe. SmartBank is responsible for determining whether any potential and/or existing customers appear on the SDN List or are owned or controlled by a person on the SDN List. If any customer appears on the SDN List or is owned or controlled by a person or entity on the SDN List, such customer's account must be placed on hold and a blocking or rejection report, as appropriate and if required, must be filed within 10 business days with OFAC. In addition, if a customer is a citizen of, has provided an address in, or is organized under the laws of any country or region for which OFAC maintains a comprehensive sanctions program, the Bank must take certain actions with respect to such customers as dictated under the relevant OFAC sanctions program. SmartBank must maintain compliance with OFAC by implementing appropriate policies and procedures and by establishing a recordkeeping system that is reasonably appropriate to administer the Bank's compliance program. SmartBank has adopted policies, procedures and controls to comply with the BSA, the USA PATRIOT Act and OFAC regulations.
Privacy and data security
Under the GLBA, federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The GLBA also directed federal regulators, including the FDIC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. SmartBank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying customers in the event of a security breach.
Consumer laws and regulations
SmartBank is also subject to other federal and state consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 
14

the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair and Accurate Transactions Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when offering consumer financial products and services.
Rulemaking authority for these and other consumer financial protection laws transferred from the prudential regulators to the CFPB on July 21, 2011. In some cases, regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Department of Justice also retain certain rulemaking or enforcement authority. The CFPB also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices, or UDAAP, and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. While the statutory language of the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth the standards for acts and practices that violate the prohibition on UDAAP, certain aspects of these standards are untested, and thus it is currently not possible to predict how the CFPB will exercise this authority. In addition, consumer compliance examination authority remains with the prudential regulators for smaller depository institutions ($10 billion or less in total assets). The possibility of changes in the authority of the CFPB going forward after President-elect Trump is sworn into office is uncertain, and we cannot ascertain the impact, if any, changes to the CFPB may have on our business, revenues, operations, or results. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, financial institutions may not make a residential mortgage loan unless they make a “reasonable and good faith determination” that the consumer has a “reasonable ability” to repay the loan. The act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure but provides a full or partial safe harbor from such defenses for loans that are “qualified mortgages.” On January 10, 2013, the CFPB published final rules to, among other things, specify the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability-to-repay determination, the permissible sources for verification, and the required methods of calculating the loan’s monthly payments. Since then the CFPB made certain modifications to these rules. The rules extend the requirement that creditors verify and document a borrower’s “income and assets” to include all “information” that creditors rely on in determining repayment ability. The rules also provide further examples of third-party documents that may be relied on for such verification, such as government records and check-cashing or funds-transfer service receipts. The new rules were effective beginning on January 10, 2014. The rules also define “qualified mortgages,” imposing both underwriting standards-for example, a borrower’s debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43 percent-and limits on the terms of their loans. Points and fees are subject to a relatively stringent cap, and the terms include a wide array of payments that may be made in the course of closing a loan. Certain loans, including interest-only loans and negative amortization loans, cannot be qualified mortgages.
On October 3, 2015, the CFPB implemented a final rule combining the mortgage disclosures consumers previously received under TILA and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA. For more than 30 years, the TILA and RESPA mortgage disclosures had been administered separately by, respectively, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The final rule requires lenders to provide applicants with the new Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure and generally applies to most closed-end consumer mortgage loans for which the creditor or mortgage broker receives an application on or after October 3, 2015.
Volcker Rule
The Volcker Rule generally prohibits a “banking entity” (which includes any insured depository institution, such as SmartBank, or any affiliate or subsidiary of such depository institution, such as SmartFinancial) from engaging in proprietary trading and acquiring or retaining any ownership interest in, sponsoring, or engaging in certain transactions with, a “covered fund”. Both the proprietary trading and covered fund-related prohibitions are subject to a number of exemptions and exclusions. The Volcker Rule became effective by statute in July 2012, and on December 10, 2013, five federal regulators including the FDIC and the Federal Reserve jointly adopted the final regulations to implement the Volcker Rule. The final regulations contain exemptions for, among others, market making, risk-mitigating hedging, underwriting, and trading in U.S. government and agency obligations and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of funds to be retained. They also permit the offering and sponsoring of funds under certain conditions. In addition, the final regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities.
The final regulations became effective on April 1, 2014, and banking entities were required to conform their proprietary trading activities and investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place after December 31, 2013 by July 21, 2015. For those banking entities whose investments in and relationships with covered funds were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (“legacy covered funds”), the Volcker Rule conformance period was recently extended by the Federal Reserve to July 21, 2017 for such legacy covered funds. In addition, the Federal Reserve has also indicated its intention to grant two additional one-year extensions of the conformance period to July 21, 2017, for banking entities to conform ownership interests in and sponsorship of 
15

activities of collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, that are backed in part by non-loan assets and that were in place as of December 31, 2013.
FIRREA and FDICIA
Far-reaching legislation, including the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or FIRREA, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, have impacted the business of banking for years. FIRREA primarily affected the regulation of savings institutions rather than the regulation of commercial banks and bank holding companies like SmartBank and SmartFinancial, but did include provisions affecting deposit insurance premiums, acquisitions of thrifts by banks and bank holding companies, liability of commonly controlled depository institutions, receivership and conservatorship rights and procedures and substantially increased penalties for violations of banking statutes, regulations and orders.
FDICIA resulted in extensive changes to the federal banking laws. The primary purpose of FDICIA was to authorize additional borrowings by the FDIC in order to assist in the resolution of failed and failing financial institutions. However, the law also instituted certain changes to the supervisory process and contained various provisions affecting the operations of banks and bank holding companies.
The additional supervisory powers and regulations mandated by FDICIA include a “prompt corrective action” program based upon five regulatory zones for banks, in which all banks are placed largely based on their capital positions. Regulators are permitted to take increasingly harsh action as a bank’s financial condition declines. Regulators are also empowered to place in receivership or require the sale of a bank to another depository institution when a bank’s ratio of tangible equity to total assets reaches two percent. Better capitalized institutions are generally subject to less onerous regulation and supervision than banks with lesser amounts of capital. The Federal Reserve has adopted regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDICIA, which place financial institutions into one of the following five categories based upon capitalization ratios as these ratios have been amended following regulations implementing the requirements of Basel III: (1) a “well capitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8 percent, a leverage ratio of at least 5 percent and a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5 percent; (2)  an “adequately capitalized” institution has a total risk-based ratio of at least 8 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of at least 6 percent, a leverage ratio of at least 4 percent and a CET1 capital ratio of at least 4.5 percent; (3) an “undercapitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of under 8 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of under 6 percent, a leverage ratio of under 4 percent or a CET1 capital ratio of less than 4.5 percent; (4) a “significantly undercapitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of under 6 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of under 4 percent, a leverage ratio of under 3 percent or a CET1 capital ratio of less than 3 percent; and (5) a “critically undercapitalized” institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2 percent or less. Institutions in any of the three undercapitalized categories would generally be prohibited from declaring dividends or making capital distributions. The regulations also establish procedures for “downgrading” an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.
Various other sections of the FDICIA impose substantial audit and reporting requirements and increase the role of independent accountants and outside directors. Set forth below is a list containing certain other significant provisions of the FDICIA:

• | annual on-site examinations by regulators (except for smaller, well-capitalized banks with high management ratings, which must be examined every 18 months);


• | mandated annual independent audits by independent public accountants and an independent audit committee of outside directors for institutions with more than $500,000,000 in assets;


• | uniform disclosure requirements for interest rates and terms of deposit accounts;


• | a requirement that the FDIC establish a risk-based deposit insurance assessment system;


• | authorization for the FDIC to impose one or more special assessments on its insured banks to recapitalize the bank insurance fund (now called the Deposit Insurance Fund);


• | a requirement that each institution submit to its primary regulators an annual report on its financial condition and management, which report will be available to the public;


• | a ban on the acceptance of brokered deposits except by well capitalized institutions and by adequately capitalized institutions with the permission of the FDIC, and the regulation of the brokered deposit market by the FDIC;


• | restrictions on the activities engaged in by state banks and their subsidiaries as principal, including insurance underwriting, to the same activities permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries unless the state bank is well capitalized and a determination is made by the FDIC that the activities do not pose a significant risk to the insurance fund;


• | a review by each regulatory agency of accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with federal banking agencies and a mandate to devise uniform requirements for all such filings;

16


• | the institution by each regulatory agency of noncapital safety and soundness standards for each institution it regulates which cover (1) internal controls, (2) loan documentation, (3) credit underwriting, (4) interest rate exposure, (5) asset growth, (6) compensation, fees and benefits paid to employees, officers and directors, (7) operational and managerial standards, and (8) asset quality, earnings and stock valuation standards for preserving a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares (if feasible);


• | uniform regulations regarding real estate lending; and


• | a review by each regulatory agency of the risk-based capital rules to ensure they take into account adequate interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risks of non-traditional activities.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, increased the threshold under which a bank or bank holding company may terminate registration of a security under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to 1,200 shareholders of record from 300. The JOBS Act also raised the threshold requiring companies to register to 2,000 shareholders from 500. Since the JOBS Act was signed, numerous banks or bank holding companies have filed to deregister their common stock.
Future legislative developments
Legislative acts that impact SmartFinancial and SmartBank are introduced in Congress and the Tennessee legislature from time to time. This legislation may change banking statutes and the environment in which we operate in substantial and unpredictable ways. Due to the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, changes to legislation surrounding taxes, consumer protection laws, regulation of financial institutions, and other topics relevant to our company will likely be considered in Congress in the coming four years. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential changes to legislation, if enacted, or implementing regulations and interpretations with respect thereto, would have our financial condition or results of operations.
