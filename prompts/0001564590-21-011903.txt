Item 1. Business
Overview
 Oak Street Health, Inc. (collectively referred to as “Oak Street Health,” “OSH,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on October 22, 2019 for the purpose of completing a public offering and related restructuring transactions (collectively referred to as the “IPO”) in order to carry on the business of Oak Street Health, LLC (“OSH LLC”) and its affiliates. As the managing member of OSH LLC, Oak Street Health, Inc. operates and controls all of the business affairs of OSH LLC and its affiliates. Following the IPO, Oak Street Health, Inc. consolidates the financial results of OSH LLC. For further discussion related to the IPO, see Note 1 in Part IV Item 15. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “OSH.”
 The Company operates primary care centers within the United States serving Medicare beneficiaries. The Company, through its centers and management services organization, combines an innovative care model with superior patient experience. The Company invests resources into primary care to prevent unnecessary acute events and manage chronic illnesses. The Company engages Medicare eligible patients through the use of an innovative community outreach approach. Once patients are engaged, the Company integrates population health analytics, social support services and primary care into the care model to drive improved outcomes. The Company contracts with health plans to generate medical costs savings and realize a return on its investment in primary care. As of December 31, 2020, the Company operated 79 centers in 16 markets across 11 states, which provided care for approximately 97,000 patients. We, together with our affiliated physician practice organizations, employed approximately 3,200 team members, including approximately 300 primary care providers. Our operations are organized and reported under one segment.Mission
 Since our founding in 2012, our mission has been to build a primary care delivery platform that directly addresses rising costs and poor outcomes, two of the most pressing challenges facing the United States healthcare industry. Our patient-centered approach focuses on meaningfully improving the quality of care for the most at-risk populations. It represents the frontline implementation of the solutions addressing the most powerful trends in healthcare, mainly the shift towards value-based care and increasing patient consumerism. Our approach disrupts the current state of care delivery for Medicare-eligible patients and aligns the incentives of our patients, our providers and our payors by simultaneously improving health outcomes and care quality, lowering medical costs and improving the patient experience.
 To pursue our mission, we created a technology-enabled, integrated platform, which we refer to as the Oak Street Platform, to deliver value-based care focused exclusively on Medicare patients. The key attributes that differentiate the Oak Street Platform include:
  
• | Our patient focus. We are focused on the Medicare-eligible population, which generally has consistent, clinically cohesive needs and which we believe represents the greatest potential for cost savings, while still benefiting patient health outcomes, in our current healthcare system.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our technology-enabled model. We leverage technology that compiles and analyzes comprehensive patient data and provides actionable health insights through applications that are embedded in care delivery workflows, including at the point of patient-provider interaction.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our integrated approach to care delivery. We integrate a personalized approach to primary care, proactive management of our patients’ health needs and expanded preventive services to keep our patient population healthy, reducing the number of hospitalizations and other expensive and unnecessary utilization of the healthcare system. As such, we focus on delivering what we believe to be the right care in the right setting, encouraging our patients to visit us in our centers, while also offering robust virtual and digital engagement options.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our value-based relationships. Our value-based capitation contracts reward us for providing high- quality care rather than driving a high volume of services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Organization 
  
• | We operate through our direct and indirect subsidiaries, primarily, Oak Street Health MSO, LLC (“OSH MSO”). OSH MSO operates as a management services organization and is in the business of providing management and other administrative services to our affiliated physician practice organizations under long-term management and/or administrative services agreements (“MSAs”), pursuant to which OSH MSO manages certain non-medical services for the physician practice organizations and has authority over all non-medical decision making related to ongoing business operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We operate one Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) that participates in the Medicare Shared Saving Program to serve the Medicare fee-for-service (“FFS”) population known as Acorn Network, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of OSH MSO.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Some states have laws that prohibit business entities with non-physician owners from practicing medicine, which are generally referred to as the corporate practice of medicine. States that have corporate practice of medicine laws require only physicians
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to practice medicine, exercise control over medical decisions or engage in certain arrangements with other physicians, such as fee-splitting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Therefore, in addition to our subsidiaries, we mainly operate by maintaining long-term management services agreements with our affiliated physician practice organizations, which are owned, directly or indirectly, and operated by Dr. Griffin Myers, one of our founders and our Chief Medical Officer, and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide medical services. Under such agreements, we provide and perform non-medical management and administrative services, including financial management, information systems, marketing, risk management and administrative support.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have entered into MSAs with several affiliated professional organizations, including Oak Street Health Physicians Group, PC; OSH-RI Physicians Group, PC; OSH-MI Physicians Group, PC; OSH-NJ Physicians Group, PC; OSH-IL Physicians Group, PC; OSH-OH Physicians Group, LLC; OSH-PA Physicians Group, PC; Oak Street Health of Texas, PLLC; OSH-IN Physicians Group, PC; Griffin Myers Medical, PC and Oak Street Health Physicians Group of Mississippi, LLC (each, a “PC”). These affiliated PCs contract with various managed care organizations or licensed health care service plans, each of which pays a fixed capitation payment to that particular PC. In return, that PC provides health care services by employing physicians and other providers of primary care services. The applicable PC assumes the financial risk of the cost of delivering health care services in excess of the fixed amounts received. The risk is subject to stop-loss provisions. The physicians employed by the PC are exclusively in control of, and responsible for, all aspects of the practice of medicine for their patients. In accordance with relevant accounting guidance, each of these PCs is determined to be a variable interest entity (“VIE”) of Oak Street Health as Oak Street Health has the ability, through the MSA, to direct the activities (excluding clinical decisions) that most significantly affect the PC’s economic performance. Therefore, all PCs are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lastly, we are the majority interest owner in three joint ventures: OSH-PCJ Joliet, LLC; OSH-RI, LLC and OSH-ESC Joint Venture, LLC, which are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements.

Industry Overview, Challenges and our Opportunity
 According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), healthcare spending in the United States reached nearly $3.8 trillion, and Medicare accounted for $800 billion of spending in 2019. We believe the core addressable market for the Oak Street Platform is approximately 27 million Medicare eligibles in our target demographic, which we believe represents an approximate $325 billion annual industry revenue opportunity. We determine the core addressable market by multiplying an estimate of average annual revenue of $12,000 per member, which is derived from our experience and industry knowledge and which we believe represents a reasonable national assumption, by the number of Medicare eligibles in our target markets. Average spending on Medicare is projected by CMS to grow approximately 7% annually, driven primarily by the aging United States population as well as the high prevalence of chronic conditions and the associated cost of care for these conditions among the Medicare eligible population.
 We reimagined the approach to caring for a patient population with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and purpose-built the Oak Street Platform to improve health outcomes and combat wasteful spending. The Oak Street Platform consists of (i) Our Centers, (ii) Our Interdisciplinary Care Teams, (iii) Canopy: Our Purpose- Built, End-to-End Technology and (iv) Our Care Delivery Approach (further discussed below). 
 Although we have incurred net losses since inception, we believe that the Oak Street Platform has enabled us to create a healthcare model where all constituencies involved have the ability to “Win.” Our patients, payors and providers are incentivized to adopt the Oak Street Platform and each has the potential to benefit in a meaningful way.
  
• | Patients. We leverage our differentiated care delivery model to improve the health of our patients, effectively manage their chronic conditions and avoid unnecessary hospitalizations while greatly improving their patient experience.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payors. We enter into arrangements with Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans to manage the care of our patients, allowing us to control the plans’ medical costs, increase the plans’ Medicare quality scoring, improve the plans’ profit margin and help the plans grow membership.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers. We enable our providers to focus on improving the lives of their patients and improve their job satisfaction by providing them with meaningful clinical support and customized technology resources.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we can translate these “Wins” into economic benefits. Since 2016, our performance has been driven by our multi-year, contractual arrangements with payors on a per patient, per month (“PPPM”) basis, which create recurring revenue streams and provide significant visibility into our financial growth trajectory. By focusing on interventions that keep our patients healthy, we can capture the cost savings the Oak Street Platform creates and reinvest them in our care model. We believe these investments lead to better outcomes and improved patient experiences, which will drive further cost savings, power patient retention and enable us to attract new patients. We believe increasing cost savings over a growing patient population will deliver an even greater surplus to the organization, enabling us to reinvest to scale and fund new centers, progress our care model and enhance our technology. 
 5

We have demonstrated an ability to rapidly scale, expanding our model to a network of 79 centers, in 16 markets across 11 states, which provided care for approximately 97,000 patients as of December 31, 2020, of which approximately 66% are under capitation arrangements (which we refer to as “at-risk patients”) and approximately 34% are fee-for-service, although fee-for-service accounted for less than 1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we, together with our affiliated physician practice organizations, employed approximately 3,200 team members, including approximately 300 primary care providers. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total revenues were $882.8 million and $556.6 million, respectively, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 59%. 
 The U.S. healthcare system is at a transition point in its evolution
 Unsustainable and rising healthcare costs
 Healthcare spending in the United States reached nearly $3.8 trillion in 2019 according to CMS, representing approximately 17.7% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”). The United States spent approximately $11,500 per person on healthcare in 2019, more than any other country in the world and twice the OECD average. Healthcare expenditures are particularly concentrated in the Medicare-eligible population due to the high rate of chronic conditions. While representing only 15% of the United States population, the 65 and older age group accounted for 34% of all healthcare spending in 2014, with an average spend of $19,098 per person. Additionally, two-thirds of the Medicare population lives with two or more chronic health conditions, and treatment of these conditions represents 96% of Medicare spending.
 Prevalence of wasteful spending and sub-optimal outcomes
 A 2019 study estimated that approximately 25% of all healthcare spending is for unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud and other problems creating waste, implying approximately $760 billion to $935 billion of annual wasteful spending at current levels.
 In 2017, hospital care accounted for the largest portion of healthcare spending in the United States, representing 33% of the total. In 2018, over 60% of Medicare expenditures (including both Medicare Part A spend and Medicare Part B institutional spend), or approximately $455 billion, were dedicated to hospitalization, compared to only approximately 3% dedicated to primary care. Proper management of chronic conditions can significantly reduce the incidence of acute episodes, which are the main drivers of trips to the emergency room and hospitalization, particularly among the elderly.
 Despite high levels of spending, the United States healthcare system struggles to produce better health outcomes and to keep doctors and patients satisfied. Life expectancy in the United States was 78.6 years in 2017, compared to 82.2 years in comparable developed countries, and patient satisfaction with the healthcare system is low, as evidenced by a Net Promoter Score of 3 for the average provider, as shown in a 2015 Advisory Board survey.
 New payment structures have begun to address the problem
 Policymakers and healthcare experts generally acknowledge the fundamental challenges and opportunities for improvement in the delivery of healthcare in the United States. Historically, healthcare delivery was centered around reactive care to acute events, which resulted in the development of a fee-for-service payment model. By linking payments to volume of encounters and pricing for higher complexity interventions, the fee-for-service model does not reward prevention but rather unintentionally incentivizes the treatment of acute care episodes as they occur. Policymakers have responded by creating programs like MA and pushing for transitions to value- based reimbursements.
  
• | Medicare Advantage. MA works as an alternative to traditional fee-for-service Medicare. In MA, CMS pays health plans a monthly sum per member to manage all health expenses of a participating member. This provides the health plans with an incentive to deliver lower-cost, high-quality care.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Value-based payments. Value-based refers to the goal of incentivizing healthcare providers to simultaneously increase quality while lowering the cost of care. In January 2015, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) announced a goal of tying 30% and 50% of all Medicare payments to value through alternative payment models by the end of 2016 and 2018, respectively. In addition, while not a policy-setting body, the Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network, an active group of public and private healthcare leaders, indicated in October of 2019 its desire to move 100% of Medicare payments to being tied to value-based care by 2025. Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation recently announced a Direct Contracting Model set to begin in April 2021 for the first performance year to create value-based payment arrangements directly with provider groups for their current Medicare fee-for-service patients similar to the value-based contracts that we enter into with our MA partners.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Legacy healthcare delivery infrastructure has been unable to transition from reactive and episodic care to proactive and comprehensive care models
 In order for shifts to value-based payment models to drive meaningful results, there must be a corresponding shift in care delivery models. To date, such care delivery models have been slow to develop. While there has been significant investment by providers, payors and 
 6

technology companies in developing solutions to drive higher quality and lower cost of care, these investments have not resulted in meaningful change within a healthcare delivery infrastructure that remains optimized for the fee-for-service model.
 In order to maintain economically viable practices in a fee-for-service payment model, typical primary care providers:
  
• | need to see an ever-increasing number of patients per day with limited support from staff, which limits time spent with each patient during office visits;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experience time constraints that restrict their ability to engage with patients outside of office visits, which is a key component of ensuring that patients continue to proactively manage their health and do not fall through the cracks of the healthcare system; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experience financial constraints that limit their ability to invest in technology and provide patients with many of the supplemental services they need, such as home-based primary care, medication management and behavioral health services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Advances in technology have disrupted multiple industries when the technology was thoughtfully applied and integrated. These new business models, systems and approaches have replaced legacy offerings and driven significant changes in consumer behavior. We believe that an integrated, value-based care platform enabled by data and technology has the potential to similarly revolutionize the healthcare industry.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted challenges with the current legacy healthcare delivery system. As healthcare providers were faced with dwindling fee-for-service visits in light of the stay-at-home orders and general patient fear, the revenues of traditional healthcare providers plummeted thereby putting a strain on those providers and their ability to provide needed care for their patients.
 Our Market Opportunity
 We have designed the Oak Street Platform to bring technology-enabled, value-based care to the Medicare- eligible population, which represents the highest proportion of healthcare spending in the United States. We target populations of Medicare beneficiaries in high-density urban and suburban areas and further refine our target markets by utilizing socioeconomic data to target areas suffering from poor care quality and higher unnecessary spend. 
 As of 2018, there were approximately 60 million Medicare beneficiaries in the United States, with an additional 10,000 individuals reaching the age of eligibility every day. Healthcare spending in the United States reached nearly $3.8 trillion and Medicare accounted for $800 billion of spending in 2019. We estimate our addressable market of Medicare eligibles, based on the criteria set out above, to be 27 million patients. Based upon our experience and industry knowledge, we estimate average annual revenue of $12,000 per member. Multiplying this figure by the number of Medicare eligibles in our target markets, we arrive at what we believe is an annual total addressable market size of approximately $325 billion.
 The Oak Street Platform is Re-Defining Primary Care
 We reimagined the approach to caring for a patient population with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and purpose-built the Oak Street Platform to improve our patients’ health outcomes and combat wasteful spending, providing a higher-quality alternative to the status quo. Our Oak Street Platform consists of (i) Our Centers, (ii) Our Interdisciplinary Care Teams, (iii) Canopy: Our Purpose-Built, End-to-End Technology and (iv) Our Care Delivery Approach.
 Our Centers
 Our novel approach starts with retail-like, community-based centers that implement a branded and consumer-focused design to create a welcoming environment that engages our patients. These centers are leased or licensed by OSH MSO or an affiliated entity and, pursuant to the terms of certain contractual relationships between OSH MSO and our affiliated medical practices, made available for use by the medical practices in the provision of primary care services. While traditional healthcare facilities are often located in medical office buildings that are removed from where patients spend a majority of their time, we target locations in highly accessible, convenient locations close to where our patients live. Each of our centers has a consistent look and feel, which we believe differentiates Oak Street and contributes to our success in acquiring patients.
Our Interdisciplinary Care Teams
 We utilize a team-based approach in our patient-focused primary care delivery model and staff interdisciplinary care teams (“Care Team”) to execute our model. Each Care Team is led by a Primary Care Physician or Nurse Practitioner who is partnered with a Registered Nurse, a Medical Assistant and a Scribe to deliver value-based, coordinated care. As a center grows, we increase the number of Care Teams serving that center in order to keep the average number of patients per Care Team low to ensure optimal care quality and patient experience.
 Our Care Teams are trained in preventive and comprehensive care designed to address the whole person, across medical, social and behavioral attributes, in a welcoming and friendly manner. Our Care Teams meet daily to discuss their approach for each patient they will see that day and have weekly and monthly planning and review sessions for their sickest patients to assess their progress and determine the 
 7

next steps in improving their health. Care is provided in several different ways, including face-to-face visits, telehealth visits, remote patient monitoring and in-home care.
 Canopy: Our Purpose-Built, End-to-End Technology
 Canopy is a key driver of the success of our care model and underlies every aspect of our day-to-day patient engagement and workflows. Canopy comprises of internally developed software that connects a suite of population health analytics and technology applications designed to fit seamlessly into our care delivery model and Care Team virtual and in-person workflows.
 Our position in the healthcare ecosystem allows Canopy to access and capture an immense amount of data about our patients from a broad set of sources, including payor claims data, pharmacy data and medical records from hospitals and specialists. Canopy enhances our ability to quickly structure and sort these disparate data sets to develop a comprehensive view of both our patients and our target demographic across medical, behavioral and social health attributes. We leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to create and refine our clinical rules engine (predictive models and prescriptive algorithms) that informs care delivery and addresses hospital admissions and readmissions, medical costs and patient retention. Our algorithms are internally developed and optimized for the primary care setting, undergo rapid iteration cycles and benefit from clinician partnership and input.
 When paired with our operational expertise, we believe Canopy is a key driver in our ability to scale our platform quickly and consistently, while delivering evidence-based care in a value-based model.
 Our Care Delivery Approach
 Our care delivery approach consists of three core components:
  
• | Personalized Primary Care. We provide preventative care addressing the needs of the whole person— medical, social and behavioral. Upon joining Oak Street Health, our patients undergo a structured geriatric assessment to understand their care needs. We input these assessments, along with other available data, into Canopy, which analyzes multiple patient risk factors using our internally developed algorithms to stratify patients by the risk of their experiencing an acute event. Based on this analysis, we create a tailored, individualized care plan that determines the ideal frequency of primary care visits and use of disease-specific programs. Our patients experience the results of this differentiated approach through approximately eight physician visits per year, significantly more visits than a patient can expect with a typical primary care physician, with our sickest patients being seen even more frequently. In addition, we manage the total number of patients assigned to a Care Team at each center to allow each Care Team to spend more time with their patients and reduce wait times.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proactive Patient Health Management. In addition to spending more time with our patients, our smaller ratio of patients to Care Teams allows our physicians to reserve time daily to review their patients’ care plans and each week conduct a deeper dive on high-risk patients. The Oak Street Platform leverages Canopy’s robust data and analytics to generate insights, which are fed into our custom-built workflow applications in order to identify additional actions to take, gaps to close and interventions to perform on our patients. This systematic review of each of our patients is designed to ensure that once a Medicare member becomes an Oak Street patient, they stay current with their recommended health management plan, do not fall through the cracks of the healthcare systems and therefore remain on the path to better health.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced Clinical Services. Using Canopy’s internally developed algorithms, we identify high-risk patients with specific needs outside of primary care and provide multi-disciplinary interventions to improve outcomes and reduce cost. We offer a number of programs that are integrated into our care model and that would not typically be available to patients under legacy fee-for-service models, including behavioral health, home-based primary care by dedicated provider teams, virtual digital offerings, medication management, social determinant support, 24x7 live phone support by our clinical call center and transitional care support to help our patients navigate the care journey outside of our centers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Impact
 Our care model has consistently demonstrated outstanding clinical results, removed costs and delivered an industry-leading patient experience. By reducing utilization of high-cost, and often unnecessary, episodes of care and focusing on providing less expensive preventive care to our patients, we can reduce instances of expensive emergency care and hospitalization, which lowers the overall cost of care in the healthcare system. As we deliver on keeping our patients healthier, we capture the cost savings and drive our profitability. 
We Are Engineered to be Scalable
 We have proven our ability to execute our model, evidenced by the consistency of our performance as we have grown to date. Our performance has improved each year and we have seen our model work across all of our markets. Since opening our initial centers in 2013:

• | Our center-level contribution ramp has nearly uniformly improved across each subsequent vintage, driven by:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | patient-level contribution (defined as capitated revenue less medical claims expense) continuing to trend upward by vintage, both overall and when adjusted by tenure; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | steady patient growth across vintages.
--+---------------------------------------

 8

 
• | We have generated consistent center-level contribution ramps across all of our markets, driven by both core drivers of center contribution:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | consistent patient contribution across markets; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


o | steady patient growth across markets.
--+--------------------------------------

 This consistent performance gives us the conviction to continue to invest in identifying and building centers, hiring top-tier talent and attracting patients in existing and new markets in order to drive long-term value creation.
 We believe that we have created a repeatable, data-driven playbook to expand our brand and presence across the United States and we have made substantial investments to support each key component of our approach. The fundamental aspects of our playbook include an algorithmic approach to site selection based on our key criteria, a focused approach to recruiting and developing talent (including physicians, nurse practitioners, Care Team members and regional leaders) and an efficient go-to-market model with grassroots community outreach to engage and attract patients.
 Our Value Proposition
 We believe that, despite a history of net losses, our healthcare ecosystem provides all constituencies involved in our care delivery model with the opportunity to “Win.” The Oak Street Platform incentivizes our patients, our payors and our providers to adopt our vision and rewards them each in a meaningful way.
Our Patients “Win” due to Measurably Better Health Outcomes and Patient Experience
 Our patients have complex health needs. As of 2017, the average income of our patient base, as self- reported to us, was approximately $20,700. Approximately 45% of our patients are dual eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid as of the year ended December 31, 2020. Approximately 40% of our patients have a behavioral health diagnosis and approximately 50% struggle with one or more social risk factors like isolation and lack of access to housing and food that are considered social determinants of health. Approximately 86% of our at-risk patients have one or more chronic conditions, with the average at-risk patient having three or more chronic conditions. We currently provide care to this population in at least seven different languages. The Oak Street Platform is designed to address their needs and drive top-rated quality performance, outstanding health outcomes and an experience our patients love. 
 Our Payors “Win” as Medical Costs Decline, Membership Volumes Increase, and Medicare Quality Metrics Improve
 Although we have limited experience managing contracts with full risk, since entering into our first fully capitated contracts in 2016 we have worked closely with key payors to improve outcomes for patients. Our demonstrated track record of improving patient outcomes enables payors to become net beneficiaries when we open centers in locations where they have insured Medicare members or desire to grow. Payors dedicate a large share of their efforts to reducing medical costs and they have a strong desire to engage with solutions proven to achieve that goal. We believe that our ability to remove unnecessary costs through a comprehensive approach to patient care makes us a partner of choice for payors and allows payors to lock in improved medical cost performance. Also, our strong performance in Medicare quality metrics, as demonstrated by our achievements in addressing Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) gaps and adherence to evidence-based care guidelines, supports improvements in payors’ quality score, which increases their revenues. On the whole, we believe we represent an attractive opportunity for payors to meaningfully improve their financial results.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had contractual relationships with 25 payor partners, including all of the top five national MA payors. A significant portion of our revenues is concentrated with three large payors, Humana, WellCare/ Meridian and Cigna HealthSpring, which together comprised approximately 71% of our capitated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, with 45% from Humana, 15% from WellCare/ Meridian and 11% from Cigna HealthSpring.
 Our Providers “Win” because the Oak Street Platform Allows Them to Focus on Improving the Lives of Their Patients
 Our providers are supported by integrated Care Teams that partner together to take care of patients and allow providers to spend more time with patients. Additionally, the Oak Street Platform is enabled by technology that our providers leverage to ensure they are aware of each patient’s health history and potential risks, helping to inform proper diagnoses. The Oak Street Platform is designed to reward quality, not quantity, of care. Provider compensation is determined by quality measures across the population of patients for which they are responsible and is not linked to visit volume. This dynamic is valued by providers because it reduces the potential for burnout and rewards them for making decisions in the best interest of their patients.
 The net result of our model is that our providers have a smaller number of patients to care for, more time with patients, more support from our Care Teams and better technology to help them care for patients.
 We “Win” through a Virtuous Cycle that Promotes Growth across All Facets of Our Business and Drives Our Financial Results
 The Oak Street Platform generates a positive feedback loop that can drive our expansion and can perpetuate growth, unlocking the embedded economics of our business as we add centers and those centers mature. We built Oak Street Health to serve patients and provide 
 9

measurably better health in all communities we serve. By reducing overall cost by increasing the investment in primary and preventive care, we put the dollars where they better serve our patients and increase their overall wellbeing. We have created a model that incentivizes all constituencies to work together, because everyone “Wins.” When all constituencies benefit, we can share in the value. By structuring the majority of our contracts with MA plans as fully capitated arrangements for managing their members, we capture the meaningful value we create by increasing care quality, improving health outcomes and saving the healthcare system money. This potential surplus can then be reinvested in the business to expand and improve our care model which leads to more savings, powering a self-driven cycle of investment and growth that we believe allows us to scale nationally and rebuild healthcare as it should be.
 Our Competitive Advantages
 We Purpose-Built the Oak Street Platform from the Ground Up
 The Oak Street Platform was designed to manage Medicare-eligible patients’ total cost of care through capitated, value-based payments. We designed a brand-new model because the existing primary care infrastructure was not built to be able to provide the type of care necessary to drive the massive improvements in cost and quality the health system needs. We decided to focus on the Medicare market due to its size, growth tailwinds and largely clinically cohesive population. We designed the Oak Street Platform to take risk in managing patients’ health below an agreed-upon baseline cost because we believed there was a meaningful opportunity to generate system-wide cost savings and we saw an opportunity to capture the value we created by delivering those results. The purposeful design of the Oak Street Platform against a specific population with similar clinical needs differentiates it from the majority of other players in the healthcare delivery system.
We Have a First Mover Advantage
 Our care delivery model is the result of years of research, observation, iteration and enhancement, and we continue to invest in improving our approach. Due to our existing scale, growth trajectory and demonstrated ability to drive improving center-level financials, we believe we have access to more capital and operational expertise than potential new entrants, meaning we will be able to continue to improve our model more quickly than new entrants are able to develop their models, build scale and become our competitors.
Positive Feedback Loop Accelerates Our Business
 We have created an environment in which our strong performance in one dimension accelerates performance in another, which, in turn, leads to growth in yet another aspect of our business.
 Custom-Designed, Integrated End-to-End Technology
 Canopy is designed to fit seamlessly into our care delivery model and Care Team workflows. As we scale, so does our technology. With the benefit of larger data pools as our business grows, Canopy will be able to produce increasingly powerful data insights that will equip us with more tools to improve the health of our patients. We believe that we have only begun to unlock the value of our data assets, which are growing rapidly as we open new centers and add more patients.
 Organic, Community-Based Marketing and Patient Recruitment
 We employ a multichannel marketing strategy that goes directly to our target customer. We fundamentally control our own destiny and can scale the number of centers on our platform rapidly and fill them with any interested patients we attract.
Highly Recurring Customer Base Creates Subscription-Like Revenue Model
 Our patients benefit from our offering and they rarely leave. Because we generate the majority of our revenue on a PPPM basis and we are able to consistently retain patients, we have significant visibility into our future financial performance. This provides us the flexibility to quickly adapt to changing circumstances and deliver what we believe to be the right care in the right setting, as we did with telehealth in the spring of 2020, without having an immediate adverse impact to our revenue.
A Flexible Model Able to Match Patient Needs and Preferences
 The COVID-19 pandemic is creating difficulties for traditional fee-for-service model providers to provide care while causing changes to patient’s preferred means of engagement. The changes in preference are not uniform, with some patients preferring traditional in-person visits while others would prefer leveraging telehealth. It is unknown how these preferences will evolve both during and after the pandemic. Additionally, clinical needs of patients vary. Given the high disease burden of our patients, we believe in-person care will remain a necessity for the vast majority, with our sickest patients generally requiring more in-person care.
 However, we believe we have been able to effectively complement in-person care with telehealth visits and can continue to do so. For reasons of both patient preference and clinical need, we believe our model’s adaptability and our ability to effectively engage our patients in numerous ways without negatively impacting our capitated revenue will be an advantage for Oak Street Health.

 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Operations
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world and throughout the United States has altered the behavior of businesses and people, with significant negative effects on federal, state and local economies, the duration of which is unknown at this time. Various policies were implemented by federal, state and local governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that caused may people to remain at home and forced the closure of or limitations on certain businesses, as well as suspended elective procedures by health care facilities. While some of these restrictions have been eased across the U.S. and most states have lifted moratoriums on non-emergent procedures, some restrictions remain in place, and many state and local governments are re-imposing certain restrictions due to the increasing rates of COVID-19 cases. The virus disproportionately impacts older adults, especially those with chronic illnesses, which describes many of our patients.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, we took the following actions to ensure the safety of our employees and their families and to address the physical, mental and social health of our patients:
  
• | Created a COVID-19 Response Team in March 2020 that is supported by team members from across our organization to ensure a coordinated response to the pandemic;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Temporarily closed all of our corporate offices and enabled our entire corporate work force to work remotely;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implemented travel restrictions for non-essential business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transitioned much of our center-based care to be delivered by our providers virtually through newly developed telehealth capabilities, including video and telephone through June 2020 but have transitioned our business back to a more normal operating cadence as of July 2020, including seeing a larger proportion of our patients via in-center visits (with a corresponding reduction in telehealth visits) while maintaining stringent safety protocols to minimize the potential transmission of COVID-19. We plan to leverage our telehealth capabilities as a means of interacting with our patients to the extent an in-person visit is not required or preferred;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Made operational changes to the staffing and operations of our centers, which remain open as “essential” businesses, to minimize potential exposure to and transmission of COVID-19;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Temporarily delayed planned openings of new centers through August 2020 but have refocused our efforts on driving growth to our business through patient outreach and starting August 2020, we resumed opening new centers. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 79 centers, 28 of which opened in 2020;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Temporarily halted community outreach and other marketing initiatives which drive new patients to our platform through June 2020 but restarted marketing initiatives during the third quarter of 2020;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquired and deployed significantly greater amounts of personal protective equipment (“PPE”) to ensure the safety of our employees and patients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Created a program called “COVID Care” to actively monitor our patients for suspected COVID-19 infections with the goal of managing those symptoms to keep our patients safely out of the hospital unless and until necessary due to the potential infection risks in the hospital environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Redeployed our contracted and employed drivers, who typically transport patients to our centers, to deliver food from food pantries to our patients to address food supply issues or challenges;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provided free rapid COVID-19 tests to all members of the Chicago community; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Launched an effort in January 2021 to vaccinate frontline healthcare workers (both employees of Oak Street Health and non-employees), our patients and other eligible members of our communities. While this work is critically important for our communities, we also expect our agile vaccination efforts will result in greater brand awareness and loyalty and incremental patient growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position as of year ended December 31, 2020; although our decisions to defer center openings and limit patient outreach and marketing initiatives resulted in 
 11

slower growth than we would have otherwise experienced in 2020. Over 96% of our total revenues are recurring, consisting of fixed monthly per-patient-per-month capitation payments we receive from MA plans. 
 We do expect COVID-19 to impact both our per- patient capitated revenue due to lower risk scores for new patients and our medical claims expense. Although we expect risk scores for existing Oak Street Health patients to be consistent with our historical experience, due to a lack of availability of care and inadequate documentation as discussed in more detail below, we expect lower risk scores for new patients in 2021, which will result in lower per-patient capitated revenue.  As future patients not served by Oak Street Health in 2020 were unable to access the healthcare system for several months in 2020 due to local COVID-19 restrictions and therefore had fewer interactions with healthcare providers than a typical year, we expect the risk scores for these new patients in 2021 to be lower than they have been historically.    
 As we are financially responsible for essentially all of the healthcare costs associated with our at-risk patients whether we provide that care or a third party provides that care, we suspect that the healthcare costs of patients infected with COVID-19 will be greater than had COVID-19 not occurred. It is impossible, however, to know what other healthcare issues these patients may have encountered in their pre-COVID-19 lives and whether the COVID-19 costs are or will be greater or lesser than the costs these patients would otherwise incur. Additionally, because of the extraordinary measures taken by local governments in our markets particularly in the second quarter of 2020, all of our patients had more limited access to healthcare services, including healthcare specialists such as cardiologists or orthopedists, to schedule both inpatient and outpatient surgeries, and to some extent hospital care. Beginning in late March 2020 and extending through most of the second quarter of 2020, our patients who were not infected with COVID-19 incurred lower healthcare costs than we would have otherwise expected, which will result in lower medical claims expense that we incur. We expect the vast majority of these costs are just delayed and will be incurred at future points in time and it is possible that the deferral of healthcare services could cause additional health problems in our existing patients, which could increase our costs in the future. In the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we did experience an increase in medical costs to levels above historical norms.  Because of the COVID-19 related volatility in medical cost data in 2020, we do not believe that our 2020 medical cost data can serve as a reliable basis for estimating our 2021 performance and given the fact that we do not know what the impact to medical costs will be as a result of the surge in COVID-19 cases at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.  Given these factors, per-patient medical costs may be greater in 2021 than the levels we experienced in our recent historical results. Furthermore, given the time it takes for medical claims to be submitted to MA plans, adjudicated, and sent to us, we believe it will be several quarters before we will be able to accurately calculate the impact on medical claims expense from the COVID-19 pandemic. We do believe, however, that the impact on per-patient revenue and medical claims related to COVID-19 that we expect to experience will not have a materially detrimental effect on our long-term financial performance.
 The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, future results of operations and financial condition will depend on future factors that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 including the impact of new variants of the virus, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on our markets. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the scope and duration of stay-at-home practices and business closures and restrictions, government-imposed or recommended suspensions of elective procedures, and expenses required for supplies and personal protective equipment. Because of these and other uncertainties, we cannot estimate the length or severity of the impact of the pandemic on our business. Furthermore, because of our business model, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial condition until future periods. We will continue to closely evaluate and monitor the nature and extent of these potential impacts to our business, results of operations and liquidity.
 See “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
 Intellectual Property and Licenses
 This filing includes our trademarks and service marks, such as “Oak Street Health,” which are protected under applicable intellectual property laws and are the property of us or our subsidiaries. This filing also contains trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights of other companies, such as “Humana,” “WellCare,” and “Cigna HealthSpring,” which are the property of their respective owners. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this filing may appear without the ® or ™ symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names.
 Our continued growth and success depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and internally developed technology, including Canopy. We primarily protect our intellectual property through a combination of copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment-of-invention agreements with our employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business). Based upon our experience providing care in 79 centers in 16 markets across 11 states as of December 31, 2020, we continuously evaluate the needs of our providers and the tools that Canopy can provide and make improvements and add new features based on those needs. Although we do not currently hold a patent for Canopy, we continually assess the most appropriate methods of protecting our intellectual property and may decide to pursue available protections in the future. 
 However, these intellectual property rights and procedures may not prevent others from competing with us. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights 
 12

could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology or if the scope of our intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, others may be able to develop and commercialize technology substantially similar to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology may be adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
 Seasonal Variations in Business
 Our business experiences some variability depending upon the time of year. We experience the largest portion of our at-risk patient growth during the first quarter, when plan enrollment selections made during the prior Annual Enrollment Period (“AEP”) take effect. While we also add patients throughout the year, including during Special Enrollment Periods when certain eligible individuals can enroll in MA midyear, we would expect to see approximately half of our at-risk patient growth occur in connection with the annual enrollment period. In addition, in January of each year, CMS revises the risk adjustment factor for each patient based upon health conditions documented in the prior year, leading to an overall increase in per-patient revenue. As the year progresses, our per-patient revenue declines as new patients join us typically with less complete or accurate documentation (and therefore lower risk-adjustment scores) and patient mortality disproportionately impacts our higher-risk (and therefore greater revenue) patients. 
 Medical costs will vary seasonally depending on a number of factors, but most significantly the weather. Certain illnesses, such as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year, which will result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. We would therefore expect to see higher levels of per-patient medical costs in the first and fourth quarters. Medical costs also depend upon the number of business days in a period. See the summary of quarterly results (unaudited) in Note 21, Quarterly
 Financial Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 below. 
 Working Capital Practices
 
The Company uses various techniques to maintain working capital. The Company has historically financed its operations through private placements of our equity securities, payments received from various payors, through the issuance of a note payable to Hercules Capital, Inc. and most recently, the IPO. For additional information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources section in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7, below. 
Competitive Conditions
 
The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive. We compete with large and medium-sized local and national providers of primary care services, such as ChenMed, Iora Health and health system affiliated practices, for, among other things, contracts with payors, recruitment of physicians and other medical and non-medical personnel and individual patients. Our principal competitors for patients and payor contracts vary considerably in type and identity by market. Because of the low barriers of entry into the primary care business and the ability of physicians to own primary care centers and/or also be medical directors for their own centers, competition for growth in existing and expanding markets is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources. There have also been increasing indications of interest from non-traditional providers and others to enter the primary care space and/or develop innovative technologies or business activities that could be disruptive to the industry. For example, payors have and may continue to acquire primary care and other provider assets. Our growth strategy and business could be adversely affected if we are not able to continue to penetrate existing markets, successfully expand into new markets, maintain or establish new rela
tionships with payors, recruit qualified physicians or if we experience significant patient attrition to our competitors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The healthcare industry is highly competitive.” 
 
We believe the principal competitive factors for serving the healthcare market for adults on Medicare include: patient experience, quality of care, health outcomes, total cost of care, brand identity and trust in that brand. We believe we compete favorably on these factors.
 Government Regulations 
 
Our operations and those of our affiliated physician practice organizations are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, billings and reports to government payment programs, primary care centers and equipment, dispensing of pharmaceuticals, management of centers, personnel qualifications, maintenance of proper records, and quality assurance programs and patient care. If any of our operations or those of our affiliated physicians are found to violate applicable laws or regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price, including: 
 
•
suspension or termination of our participation in government and/or private payment programs; 
 
•
refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements dating back to the applicable statute of limitation periods; 
 13


•
loss of our licenses required to operate healthcare facilities or administer pharmaceuticals in the states in which we operate; 
 
•
criminal or civil liability, fines, damages or monetary penalties for violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Civil Monetary Penalties Law of the Social Security Act, Stark Law, the FCA and/or state analogs to these federal enforcement authorities, or other regulatory requirements; 
 
•
enforcement actions by governmental agencies and/or state law claims for monetary damages by patients who believe their health information has been used, disclosed or not properly safeguarded in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including the regulations implementing HIPAA and the Privacy Act;
 
•
mandated changes to our practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses or decrease our revenue; 
 
•
imposition of and compliance with corporate integrity agreements that could subject us to ongoing audits and reporting requirements as well as increased scrutiny of our billing and business practices which could lead to potential fines, among other things; 
 
•
termination of various relationships and/or contracts related to our business, including joint venture arrangements, contracts with payors, real estate leases and provider employment arrangements; 
 
•
changes in and reinterpretation of rules and laws by a regulatory agency or court, such as state corporate practice of medicine laws, that could affect the structure and management of our business and its affiliated physician practice corporations; 
 
•
negative adjustments to government payment models including, but not limited to, Medicare Parts A, B and C and Medicaid; and 
 
•
harm to our reputation, which could negatively impact our business relationships, the terms of payor contracts, our ability to attract and retain patients and physicians, our ability to obtain financing and our access to new business opportunities, among other things. 
 
We expect that our industry will continue to be subject to substantial regulation, the scope and effect of which are difficult to predict. Our activities could be subject to investigations, audits and inquiries by various government and regulatory agencies and private payors with whom we contract at any time in the future. Adverse findings from such investigations and audits could bring severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price. In addition, private payors could require pre-payment audits of claims, which can negatively affect cash flow, or terminate contracts for repeated deficiencies. 
 
There is no requirement in the states in which we operate for a risk-bearing provider to register as an insurance company and we have not registered as such in any of the states in which we operate. 
 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute 
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. 
 
Federal criminal penalties for the violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment, fines and exclusion of the provider from future participation in the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per kickback or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. Civil penalties for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute include up to $100,000 in monetary penalties per violation, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement and suspension from future participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Court decisions have held that the statute may be violated even if only one purpose of remuneration is to induce referrals. The ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to clarify the intent that is required to prove a violation. Under the statute as amended, the defendant does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or have the specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that any claims for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are considered false or fraudulent for purposes of the FCA. 
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. These exceptions and safe harbors are voluntary. Business transactions and arrangements that are structured to comply fully with an applicable safe 
 14

harbor do not violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law. When an arrangement does not satisfy a safe harbor, the arrangement must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse. Arrangements that do not satisfy a safe harbor may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies. 
 
We enter into several arrangements that could potentially implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute if requisite intent was present, such as: 
 
•
Joint ventures. We operate certain of our centers under joint ventures with managed care plans or other healthcare providers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, these joint ventures represented an immaterial portion of our total revenues. Although we do not expressly seek to enter into new joint ventures, it is possible that the payor landscape in certain markets we may attempt to enter in the future may make entering into additional joint ventures attractive. Our relationships with payors may not fully satisfy a safe harbor. Although failure to comply with a safe harbor does not render an arrangement illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, an arrangement that does not operate within a safe harbor may be subject to increased scrutiny and the Office of Inspector General (the “OIG”) of HHS has warned in the past that certain joint venture relationships have a potential for abuse. Joint ventures that fall outside the safe harbors are evaluated on a case-by-case basis under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. In this regard, we have endeavored to structure our joint ventures to satisfy as many elements of the safe harbor for investments in small entities as we believe are commercially reasonable. For example, we believe that these investments are offered and made by us on a fair market value basis and provide returns to the investors in proportion to their actual investment in the venture. However, since the arrangements may not satisfy all of the requirements of an applicable safe harbor, these arrangements could be subject to scrutiny on the ground that they are intended to induce patient referrals. 
 
•
Lease arrangements. We lease space for certain of our centers from one of our payor partners. We endeavor to structure these arrangements to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for space rentals in all material respects.
 
•
Discounts. Our centers sometimes acquire certain items and services at a discount that may be reimbursed by a federal healthcare program. We endeavor to structure our vendor contracts that include discount or rebate provisions to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for discounts. 
 
•
Sales forces and patient recruitment. The OIG has expressed concern regarding the use of non-employed sales forces to recruit or facilitate the recruiting of patients or referrals, especially when the sales agent is compensated in a manner that provides rewards or incentives on a volume or value basis. Accordingly, commissions or per-patient based compensation methodologies are closely scrutinized by federal agencies. We employ our own sales force and attempt to meet the Anti-Kickback Safe Harbor for Bona Fide Employment; however, in limited instances we use external companies to assist with certain aspects of these efforts, but only in arrangements that we believe do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. 
 
If any of our business transactions or arrangements, including those described above, were found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, we could face, among other things, criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal healthcare programs. Any findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price. 
 
As part of HHS’s Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care (“Regulatory Sprint”), OIG issued a request for information in August 2018 seeking input on regulatory provisions that may act as barriers to coordinated care or value-based care. In November 2020 OIG issued a final rule adding new safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute and made modifications to the civil monetary penalty law governing inducements provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries (the “CMPL”). OIG identified aspects of the Anti-Kickback Statute and CMPL that posed potential barriers to coordinated care and value based care and added new safe harbors that attempt to address those barriers. Additionally, numerous federal agencies have requested comments and information from the public and have published proposed regulations as part of the Regulatory Sprint on areas that have historically been viewed as barriers to innovative care coordination arrangements. Additionally, the Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) is also involved and has called for information from the public regarding ways that the HIPAA regulations could be modernized to support coordinated, value-based care. Additionally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (“SAMHSA”) published proposed regulations related to the privacy of substance use disorder treatment records, and CMS published proposals to revise its Stark advisory opinion process. On July 15, 2020, SAMHSA issued a final rule on the protection of substance use disorder (“SUD”) treatment records under 42 CFR Part 2 (the “Part 2 Rule”). The Part 2 final rule aims to reduce delays and burdens in care coordination by more closely aligning Part 2 with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, while maintaining certain privacy protections specific to Part 2. This final rule is effective August 14, 2020. Also of note, under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) (Pub. L. 116-136), signed into law on March 27, 2020, Congress itself made significant modifications to the authorizing statute for the Part 2 regulations, with the aim of aligning the Part 2 laws more strongly with the HIPAA privacy rule. The law directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to revise the Part 2 regulations such that the amendments would apply to uses and disclosures of SUD records the date that is 12 months after the date of enactment of the CARES Act. We anticipate many more proposals and changes into the future as part of this initiative. These changes in federal regulations are anticipated to make a significant impact on health care providers and other stakeholders These and similar changes may cause OIG, CMS or other regulators to change the parameters of rules and regulations that we must follow and thus impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
15

Risk Bearing Provider Regulation 
 
Certain of the states where we currently operate or may choose to operate in the future regulate the operations and financial condition of risk bearing providers like us and our affiliated providers. These regulations can include capital requirements, licensing or certification, governance controls and other similar matters. While these regulations have not had a material impact on our business to date, as we continue to expand, these rules may require additional resources and capitalization and add complexity to our business. 
Stark Law 
 
The Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing Designated Health Services (“DHS”) from referring Medicare patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies. Although uncertainty exists, federal agencies and at least one court have taken the position that the Stark Law also applies to Medicaid. DHS is defined to include clinical laboratory services, physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, radiology services including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scans, and ultrasound services, radiation therapy services and supplies, durable medical equipment and supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies, prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies, home health services, outpatient prescription drugs, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and outpatient speech-language pathology services. The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity providing DHS that trigger the self-referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law prohibits any entity providing DHS that has received a prohibited referral from presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim or billing for the services arising out of the prohibited referral. Similarly, the Stark Law prohibits an entity from “furnishing” a DHS to another entity in which it has a financial relationship when that entity bills for the service. The Stark Law also prohibits self-referrals within an organization by its own physicians, although broad 130 exceptions exist that cover employed physicians and those referring DHS that are ancillary to the physician’s practice to the physician group. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. Unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law is a strict liability violation where unlawful intent need not be demonstrated. 
 
If the Stark Law is implicated, the financial relationship must fully satisfy a Stark Law exception. If an exception is not satisfied, then the parties to the arrangement could be subject to sanctions. Sanctions for violation of the Stark Law include denial of payment for claims for services provided in violation of the prohibition, refunds of amounts collected in violation of the prohibition, a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral, a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law prohibition, civil assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and potential exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Amounts collected on claims related to prohibited referrals must be reported and refunded generally within 60 days after the date on which the overpayment was identified. Furthermore, Stark Law violations and failure to return overpayments in a timely manner can form the basis for FCA liability, as discussed below. 
 
If CMS or other regulatory or enforcement authorities determine that claims have been submitted for referrals by us that violate the Stark Law, we would be subject to the penalties described above. In addition, it might be necessary to restructure existing compensation agreements with our physicians. Any such penalties and restructuring or other required actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
In June 2018, CMS issued a request for information seeking input on how to address any undue regulatory impact and burden of the Stark Law. CMS placed the request for information in the context of the Regulatory Sprint and stated that it identified aspects of the Stark Law that pose potential barriers to coordinated care. In November 2020 CMS issued a final rule, in its view, that addressed the undue regulatory impact and burden of the Stark Law. CMS added new exceptions to attempt to address potential barriers to coordinated care and value based care. CMS also attempted to clarify guidance on prior rulemaking in a number of areas of the Stark Law. These or other changes implemented by CMS in the future may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
The definition of DHS under the Stark Law does not include outpatient physician services. Since most services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries provided in our centers are physician services, our services generally do not implicate the Stark Law referral prohibition. However, certain ancillary services we may provide, including certain diagnostic testing, may be considered DHS. Also, we refer Medicare beneficiaries to third parties for the provision of DHS and our financial relationships with those third parties must satisfy a Stark Law exception. 
 
We have entered into several types of financial relationships with physicians, including compensation arrangements. If our centers were to bill for a non-exempted service and the financial relationships with the physician did not satisfy an exception, we could be required to change our practices, face civil penalties, pay substantial fines, return certain payments received from Medicare and beneficiaries or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to payments made pursuant to referrals from these physicians under the Stark Law. 
 
Fraud and Abuse under State Law 
 
Some states in which we operate centers have laws prohibiting physicians from holding financial interests in various types of medical facilities to which they refer patients. Some of these laws could potentially be interpreted broadly as prohibiting physicians who hold shares of our publicly traded stock or are physician owners from referring patients to our centers if the centers perform services for their patients or 
 16

do not otherwise satisfy an exception to the law. States also have laws similar to or stricter than the federal Anti-Kickback Statute 131 that may affect our ability to receive referrals from physicians with whom we have financial relationships. Some state anti-kickback laws also include civil and criminal penalties. Some of these laws include exemptions that may be applicable to our physician relationships or for financial interests limited to shares of publicly traded stock. Some, however, may include no explicit exemption for certain types of agreements and/or relationships entered into with physicians. If these laws are interpreted to apply to physicians who hold equity interests in our centers or to physicians who hold our publicly traded stock, and for which no applicable exception exists, we may be required to terminate or restructure our relationships with these physicians and could be subject to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, refund requirements and exclusions from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price. 
 
Similarly, states have beneficiary inducement prohibitions and consumer protection laws that may be triggered by the offering of inducements, incentives and other forms of remuneration to patients and prospective patients. Violations range from civil to criminal and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting 
 
The laws and regulations relating to our operations vary from state to state and many states prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting professional fees with physicians. We currently contract with affiliated physician-owned professional corporations who provide healthcare services that are required to be provided by licensed healthcare professionals. Pursuant to the MSA, we provide comprehensive suite of administrative services to those professional corporations in exchange for the payment by such professional corporations of a management fee. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting, other parties may assert that, despite the way we are structured, we could be engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or unlawful fee-splitting. Were such allegations to be asserted successfully before the appropriate judicial or administrative forums, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative penalties, certain contracts could be determined to be unenforceable and we may be required to restructure our contractual arrangements. The laws of other states do not prohibit non-physician entities from employing physicians to practice medicine but may retain a ban on some types of fee-splitting arrangements. 
 
Violations of the corporate practice of medicine vary by state and may result in physicians being subject to disciplinary action, as well as to forfeiture of revenues from payors for services rendered. For lay entities, violations may also bring both civil and, in more extreme cases, criminal liability for engaging in medical practice without a license. Some of the relevant laws, regulations and agency interpretations in states with corporate practice of medicine restrictions have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. In limited cases, courts have required management services companies to divest or reorganize structures deemed to violate corporate practice restrictions. Moreover, state laws are subject to change. Any allegations or findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
The False Claims Act 
 
The federal FCA is a means of policing false bills or false requests for payment in the healthcare delivery system. Among other things, the FCA authorizes the imposition of up to three times the government’s damages and significant per claim civil penalties on any “person” (including an individual, organization or company) who, among other acts: 
 
•
knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; 
 
•
knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; 
 
•
knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay the government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or 
 
•
conspires to commit the above acts. 
 
In addition, amendments to the FCA and Social Security Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors. Under these provisions, within 60 days of identifying and quantifying an overpayment, a provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare Administrative Contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. An overpayment impermissibly retained could subject us to liability under the FCA, exclusion from government healthcare programs and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty statute. As a result of these provisions, our procedures for identifying and processing overpayments may be subject to greater scrutiny. 
 
The penalties for a violation of the FCA range from $5,500 to $11,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim. On June 19, 2020, the DOJ issued a final rule announcing adjustments to FCA penalties, under which 
 17

the per claim range increases to a range from $11,665 to $23,331 per claim, so long as the underlying conduct occurred after November 2, 2015. 
 
The federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs, including but not limited to coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost or other reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code, billing for care that is not considered medically necessary and false reporting of risk-adjusted diagnostic codes to MA plans. The ACA provides that claims tainted by a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false for purposes of the FCA. Some courts have held that filing claims or failing to refund amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law can form the basis for liability under the FCA. In addition to the provisions of the FCA, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Any allegations or findings that we have violated the FCA could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In addition to the FCA, the various states in which we operate have adopted their own analogs of the FCA. States are becoming increasingly active in using their false claims laws to police the same activities listed above, particularly with regard to Medicaid fee-for-service and Managed Medicaid programs. 
 
Civil Monetary Penalties Statute 
 
The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a, authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to: 
 
•
presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent; 
 
•
offering remuneration to a federal health care program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider; 
 
•
arranging contracts with an entity or individual excluded from participation in the federal health care programs; 
 
•
violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; 
 
•
making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal health care program; 
 
•
making, using or causing to be made any false statement, omission or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of services or a supplier under a federal health care program; and 
 
•
failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government. 
 
Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute and may vary depending on the underlying violation. In addition, an assessment of not more than three times the total amount claimed for each item or service may also apply and a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. 
 
We could be exposed to a wide range of allegations to which the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute would apply. We perform monthly checks on our employees, affiliated providers and certain affiliates and vendors using government databases to confirm that these individuals have not been excluded from federal programs. However, should an individual become excluded and we fail to detect it, a federal agency could require us to refund amounts attributable to all claims or services performed or sufficiently linked to an excluded individual. Likewise, our patient programs, which can include enhancements, incentives and additional care coordination not otherwise covered under traditional Medicare, could be alleged to be intended to influence the patient’s choice in obtaining services or the amount or types of services sought. Thus, we cannot foreclose the possibility that we will face allegations subject to the Civil Monetary Penalty Statute with the potential for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
Privacy and Security 
 
The federal regulations promulgated under the authority of HIPAA require us to provide certain protections to patients and their health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of “protected health information” (“PHI”) and require covered entities, which include healthcare providers and their business associates, to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic PHI. These regulations also provide patients with substantive rights with respect to their health information. 
 
18

The HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require us to enter into written agreements with certain contractors, known as business associates, to whom we disclose PHI. Covered entities may be subject to penalties for, among other activities, failing to enter into a business associate agreement where required by law or as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity and acting within the scope of the agency. Business associates are also directly subject to liability under certain HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In instances where we act as a business associate to a covered entity, there is the potential for additional liability beyond our status as a covered entity. 
 
Covered entities must notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay but no later than 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Reporting must also be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights and, for breaches of unsecured PHI involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, to the media. All impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has 134 been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving personal information without regard to the probability of the information being compromised. 
 
Violations of HIPAA by providers like us, including, but not limited to, failing to implement appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, have resulted in enforcement actions and in some cases triggered settlement payments or civil monetary penalties. Penalties for impermissible use or disclosure of PHI were increased by the HITECH Act by imposing tiered penalties of more than $50,000 per violation and up to $1.5 million per year for identical violations. In addition, HIPAA provides for criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison, with the severest penalties for obtaining and disclosing PHI with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit or otherwise) alleging non-compliance with HIPAA regulations in our maintenance of PHI. 
 
Healthcare reform 
 
In March 2010, broad healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States through the ACA. Although many of the provisions of the ACA did not take effect immediately and continue to be implemented, and some have been and may be modified before or during their implementation, the reforms could continue to have an impact on our business in a number of ways. We cannot predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to federal and state healthcare reform legislation, whether already enacted or enacted in the future, nor can we predict what form many of these regulations will take before implementation. 
 
Other aspects of the 2010 healthcare reform laws may also affect our business, including provisions that impact the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These and other provisions of the ACA remain subject to ongoing uncertainty due to developing regulations and clarifications, including those described above, as well as continuing political and legal challenges at both the federal and state levels. Since 2016, various administrative and legislative initiatives have been implemented that have had adverse impacts on the ACA and its programs. For example, in October 2017, the federal government announced that cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers would end, effective immediately, unless Congress appropriated the funds, and, in December 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes a provision that eliminates the penalty under the ACA’s individual mandate for individuals who fail to obtain a qualifying health insurance plan and could impact the future state of the exchanges. Moreover, in February 2018, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act (the “BBA”) which, among other things, repealed the Independent Payment Advisory Board that was established by the ACA and intended to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending by extending sequestration cuts to Medicare payments through fiscal year 2027. While certain provisions of the BBA may increase the scope of benefits available under MA for certain chronically ill federal health care program beneficiaries beginning in 2020, the ultimate impact of such changes cannot be predicted. 
 
While there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future, the specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future with respect to the exchanges and other core aspects of the current health care marketplace. Future elections may create conditions for Congress to adopt new federal coverage programs that may disrupt our current commercial payor revenue streams. While specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent, such changes could lower our reimbursement rates or increase our expenses. Any failure to successfully implement strategic initiatives that respond to future legislative, regulatory, and executive changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
CMS and state Medicaid agencies also routinely adjust the risk adjustment factor which is central to payment under MA and Managed Medicaid programs in which we participate. The monetary “coefficient” values associated with diseases that we manage in our population are subject to change by CMS and state agencies. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 
Other regulations 
 
Our operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non-hazardous medical waste disposal laws. These laws do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from medical services. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations require employers to provide workers who are occupationally subject to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These regulatory requirements apply to all healthcare facilities, including primary care centers, and require employers to make a determination as to which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written 
 19

exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or employ hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection control training, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls. Employers are also required to comply with various record-keeping requirements. 
 
Federal and state law also governs the dispensing of controlled substances by physicians. For example, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act governs the distribution of drug samples. Physicians are required to report relationships they have with the manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and biologics through the Open Payments Program database. Any allegations or findings that we or our providers have violated any of these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
In addition, while none of the states in which we currently operated have required it, certain states in which we may desire to do business in the future have certificate of need programs regulating the establishment or expansion of healthcare facilities, including primary care centers. These regulations can be complex and time-consuming. Any failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company employed approximately 3,200 employees, including approximately 300 primary care providers. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
 Our team has a steadfast commitment to executing on the mission and vision of our business. To achieve our goals, we have developed an “Oaky” culture centered around creating an unmatched patient experience, driving clinical excellence, taking ownership, fostering innovation and radiating positive energy. Our unique combination of talent and healthcare experience across a number of professional settings, as well as our team’s commitment to our “Oaky” culture, underpins our success in all that we do. 
 In addition, our focused approach to recruiting and developing talent allows us to attract outstanding physicians, nurse practitioners, other Care Team members and regional leaders in order to continue to grow and scale our business. We believe that this approach has supported the creation of a strong pipeline of top tier talent for leadership roles within our company and provides a differentiated value proposition for our providers. We have created multiple programs to ensure we continue to attract best-in-class teams and provide the necessary training to foster professional development. In recent years we have added a variety of training and development programs, including regional leadership development, in-house provider recruitment and a medical scribes program. We have demonstrated a consistent ability to attract and retain top clinical talent given our unique value proposition to physicians and nurse practitioners. Our team members also have a deep understanding of the communities in which our patients live, as we strive to hire from within the local community.

 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer (this means the market value of common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year), or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:
  
• | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding financial statements and executive compensation in this filing and expect to elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our shareholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
 In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under the JOBS Act until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Our election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the longer phase-in periods permitted under the JOBS Act and who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to the JOBS Act.
