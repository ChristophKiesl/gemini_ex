ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Newborn Acquisition Corp. (“we,” “us,” “our Company” or “Newborn”) is a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on April 12, 2019 as a blank check company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic location, although we intend to focus on operating businesses in Asia (excluding China) and the United States.


On February 19, 2020, we consummated an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,750,000 units (which includes full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option) (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share of our Company (“Ordinary Share”), one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000 (including full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option). We granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, which the underwriter simultaneously exercised in full with the consummation of the IPO.


On February 19, 2020, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated a private placement (“Private Placement”) with NeoGenesis Holding Co. Ltd. (“Sponsor” or “NeoGenesis”), a Cayman Islands entity that is owned and controlled by Wenhui Xiong, of 272,500 units as the underwriter exercised the over-allotment option in full (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating net proceeds of $2,445,000, which reflected settlement of the promissory note issued to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the closing of the IPO in the amount of $280,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that the warrants underlying the Private Units (i) may be exercised on a cashless basis at the holder’s option and (ii) will not be redeemable by us, in each case as long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees. Additionally, because the Private Units were issued in a private transaction, our Sponsor and its permitted transferees will be allowed to exercise the warrants included in the Private Units for cash even if a registration statement covering the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective and receive unregistered Ordinary Shares. Additionally, our Sponsor agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the registration statement relating to the IPO) until the completion of our initial business combination. The Sponsor was granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the Private Units.
 
A total of $57,500,000 from the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option Units) and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders at JPMorgan Chase Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of our initial business combination and (ii) our failure to consummate a business combination by May 19, 2021, as extended (or August 19, 2021, if further extended).
 
Recent Developments


On November 11, 2020, we entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with NB Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Purchaser”), Nuvve Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (the “Merger Sub”), Nuvve Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Nuvve”), and Ted Smith, an individual, as the representative of the stockholders of Nuvve.


Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, on November 11, 2020, we entered into subscription agreements with certain accredited investors pursuant to which the investors agreed to purchase 1,425,000 Ordinary Shares, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $14,250,000 (the “PIPE”). The investors also will receive warrants to purchase 1,353,750 Ordinary Shares. The warrants will be exercisable at $11.50 per share and have the same terms as our public warrants. The investors will receive demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the securities issued to them. The PIPE will close immediately prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Also on November 11, 2020, Nuvve entered into a bridge loan agreement with an accredited investor, pursuant to which the investor agreed to purchase a $4,000,000 convertible debenture from Nuvve. The debenture will automatically convert into shares of Nuvve common stock immediately prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
 
Acquisition Merger and Acquisition Consideration
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Nuvve will merge with Merger Sub (the “Acquisition Merger”), with Nuvve surviving and the Purchaser acquiring 100% of the equity securities of Nuvve. In exchange for their equity securities, the stockholders of Nuvve prior to the conversion of the bridge loan (the “Existing Stockholders”) and the option holders of Nuvve will receive an aggregate of approximately 10.2 million shares of common stock of the Purchaser (the “Purchaser Common Stock”). Of such shares of Purchaser Common Stock, (i) approximately 8.9 million shares of Purchaser Common Stock will be issued to the Existing Stockholders, and (ii) approximately 1.3 million shares of Purchaser Common Stock will be reserved for issuance pursuant to the Nuvve options. Ten percent of the shares to be issued to the Existing Stockholders, or approximately 0.9 million shares, will be held in escrow to satisfy any indemnification obligations incurred under the Merger Agreement. The bridge loan investor will receive additional shares of Purchaser Common Stock at the same exchange ratio as the Existing Stockholders.
 
Pursuant to a Purchase and Option Agreement between the Purchaser and one of the Existing Stockholders, immediately after the closing of the business combination, the Purchaser will repurchase 0.6 million shares of Purchaser Common Stock from such Existing Stockholder at a price of $10.00 per share. In addition, such Existing Stockholder will have the option to sell up to an additional $2 million of shares of Purchaser Common Stock back to the Purchaser within a year after the closing at a price per share equal to the then-current market price. In the event the Existing Stockholder exercises its option, two of Nuvve’s executive officers have committed to repurchase such shares from the Purchaser at the same price the Purchaser paid for them.
 
Additionally, the Existing Stockholders may be entitled to receive up to 4.0 million earn-out shares if, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, the Purchaser’s revenue equals or exceeds $30,000,000. Existing Stockholders will be entitled to a portion of the earn-out shares only if they continue to hold their shares of Purchaser Common Stock received in the Acquisition Merger through the earn-out payment date.


The parties agreed that immediately following the closing of the Acquisition Merger, Purchaser’s board of directors will consist of seven directors, five of whom shall be designated by Nuvve and two of whom will be designated by Newborn. A majority of the directors will qualify as independent directors under rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”).
 
Existing Stockholders holding shares of Nuvve capital stock representing approximately 55% of Nuvve’s outstanding voting power have entered into support agreements with Parent and Nuvve, pursuant to which, among other things, the Existing Stockholders have agreed to vote in favor of proposals to approve the Acquisition Merger.
 
Reincorporation Merger
 
Immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger, Newborn will merge with and into the Purchaser, the separate corporate existence of Newborn will cease and the Purchaser will continue as the surviving public company (the “Reincorporation Merger”). In connection with the Reincorporation Merger, Newborn’s outstanding securities will be converted into equivalent securities of the Purchaser, as follows:

● | Each of Newborn’s Ordinary Shares will be converted automatically into one share of Purchaser Common Stock.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Each right to acquire one-tenth of one Newborn Ordinary Share will be converted automatically into one-tenth of one share of Purchaser Common Stock.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one-half (1/2) of one Newborn Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share will be converted automatically into one warrant to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of Purchaser Common Stock at a price of 11.50 per whole share. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Each issued and outstanding unit of Newborn will be automatically separated into its constituent securities, with each constituent security being automatically converted into a security of the Purchaser as described in the preceding bullet points.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Each unit purchase option of Newborn will be converted automatically into one unit purchase option of Purchaser.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Promissory Notes to NeoGenesis and Nuvve
 
On February 1, 2021, we issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Working Capital Note”) in an amount of $200,000 to NeoGenesis, in exchange for NeoGenesis providing such amount for our working capital. The Working Capital Note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of the business combination. In addition, the Working Capital Note may be converted by the holder into units of our Company identical to the units issued in the IPO at a price of $10.00 per unit.
 
On February 19, 2021, we issued two unsecured promissory notes (the “Extension Notes”), each in an amount of $287,500 (or an aggregate principal amount of $575,000), to NeoGenesis and Nuvve, in exchange for NeoGenesis and Nuvve each depositing such amount into our trust account in order to extend the amount of time it has available to complete a business combination with Nuvve. The Extension Notes do not bear interest and mature upon closing of the business combination. In addition, the Extension Notes may be converted by the holder into units of our Company identical to the units issued in the IPO at a price of $10.00 per unit (which units would be immediately exchanged for securities of the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Reincorporation Merger).
 
Amendment of Merger Agreement
 
On February 20, 2021, the Company, the Purchaser, the Merger Sub, Nuvve, and Ted Smith, as the representative of the stockholders of Nuvve, entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, any loans made to Nuvve pursuant to the Payroll Protection Program pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, to the extent that such loans are eligible for forgiveness, will be excluded from Nuvve’s indebtedness for purposes of determining the merger consideration to be paid to Nuvve’s stockholders. In addition, in the event that such loans are determined not to be eligible for forgiveness within 12 months following the closing of the merger, the combined company may seek indemnification for such amounts against the shares held in escrow for indemnification purposes.
Shareholder Approval of Business Combination
 
On March 17, 2021, Hong Kong Time, we held an extraordinary general meeting (the “Extraordinary Meeting”) at which our shareholders voted to approve the business combination with Nuvve and related proposals described in detail in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 17, 2021, which was first mailed to our shareholders on or about February 17, 2021, and our proxy supplement filed with the SEC on March 8, 2021 (as amended and supplemented, the “Proxy Statement”).
 
As of February 10, 2021, the record date for the Extraordinary Meeting, there were 7,460,000 ordinary shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. There were 4,408,691 ordinary shares presented in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary Meeting.
 
Each of the proposals described in the Proxy Statement was approved by our shareholders.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
If the transaction with Nuvve does not close, we believe that our management team is well positioned to identify and implement attractive business combination opportunities in an efficient manner. Through our management team’s network, we intend to execute a business combination and ultimately create returns for our shareholders through organic growth and/or follow-on acquisitions. Our management team is led by Wenhui Xiong.
 
We will seek to capitalize on the experience and networks of our management team, Mr. Wenhui Xiong, Mr. Jianjun Nie, Mr. H. David Sherman, Mr. Jianzhong Lu and Ms. Li Wan. Our team consists of seasoned and experienced professionals who have experience in equity investments, finance, business operations and management, as well as deal negotiation. We believe our team has the ability to source attractive deals and find good investment opportunities from private and public sources in their networks. Wenhui Xiong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has over twenty years of experience in the financial and equity investment industry. He has established a strong network of investment institutions and business connections, which we believe can help us to identify attractive targets and negotiate a transaction that benefits our shareholders. Other members of our management also have extensive experience in sourcing and evaluating potential investment targets, and have developed a proprietary network of business leaders, investors and intermediaries that we believe can generate deal flow for us. H. David Sherman is a professor at Northeastern University specializing in financial and management accounting, with experience serving on the board and as audit committee chair for several public companies, including Dunxin Financial Holdings Ltd. (AMEX: DXF), Kingold Jewelry Inc. (NASDAQ: KGJI), and China HGS Real Estate Inc. (NASDAQ: HGSH). Professor Sherman was an Academic Fellow at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Division of Corporate Finance’s Office of Chief Accountant. Jianzhong Lu is a financial expert with over thirty years of experience on listed companies, including auditing, due diligence, internal control, risk management and budget management. He was previously an Audit Partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers. Li Wan has over twenty years of experiences in private equity investment, professional accounting firm, corporate financial house and enterprises. With their support, we intend to conduct a disciplined process of deal origination and evaluation, due diligence, and investment.
 
Our management team’s past performance is not an assurance that we will be able to identify an appropriate candidate for our initial business combination or achieve success with respect to the business combination we intend to consummate, and the members of our management team, other than Mr. Sherman, do not have previous experience with special purpose acquisition companies or blank check companies. However, we believe that the skills and professional network of our management team will enable us to identify, structure and consummate a business combination.

Effecting an Acquisition Transaction
 
If the transaction with Nuvve does not close, our acquisition strategy will be to capitalize on the strengths of our management team to allow us to identify businesses that have the capacity for cash flow creation, opportunity for operational improvement, robust company fundamentals, and qualified and driven management teams. Our deal sourcing process will leverage our management team’s business knowledge, industry expertise and deep network of relationships that we expect will provide us with a pipeline of acquisition candidates. Moreover, we anticipate introductions to potential acquisition candidates through various unaffiliated sources, including venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, investment bankers, management buyout funds, and other members of the financial community, as well as attorneys and accountants. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Our efforts to identify a potential target business will not be limited to a specific industry or country; however we intend to focus on targeting businesses in Asia (excluding China) and the United States. We shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China.
 
The outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, and, if the transaction with Nuvve does not close, potential target companies may defer or end discussions for a potential business combination with us whether or not COVID-19 affects their business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. We may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limiting our ability to conduct meetings to negotiate and consummate transactions in a timely manner with potential investors, target company’s personnel, or vendors and services providers. 
 
We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act.
 
Our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if only a quorum is present at the meeting at which we seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination, we would need only 125,001 of our public shares (or approximately 2.5% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved.
 
None of our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase Units or Ordinary Shares from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of Ordinary Shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.

Conversion/Tender Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The conversion rights will be effected under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law as redemptions. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares.
 
Our initial shareholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to the IPO, in the IPO or in the aftermarket.
 
We may also require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. Once the shares are converted by the holder, and effectively redeemed by us under Cayman Islands law, the transfer agent will then update our Register of Members to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any shareholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public shareholders who wish to convert their ordinary shares into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.
 
Any request to convert or tender such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.

Automatic Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
If we are not able to consummate an initial business combination before May 19, 2021, as extended (or August 19, 2021, if further extended), we will commence an automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation, unless we seek and receive the consent of our shareholders to otherwise extend the life of the Company. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Companies Law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not necessary to pay our taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the public rights will expire and will be worthless.


The amount in the trust account (less approximately $575 representing the aggregate nominal par value of the shares of our public shareholders) under the Companies Law will be treated as share premium which is distributable under the Companies Law provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.
 
Each of our initial shareholders and our Sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the insider shares and Private Units and to vote their insider shares and private shares in favor of any dissolution and plan of distribution which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our Warrants or Rights, which will expire worthless.
 
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share distribution from the trust account would be $10.00.
 
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.

Wenhui Xiong, a member of our Board of Directors, agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, he will be liable to pay debts and obligations to businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of the IPO not held in the trust account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. However, we cannot assure you that he will be able to satisfy those obligations if he is required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.00 due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least $10.00 per share.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding Warrants, Rights and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to Chardan Capital Markets LLC upon consummation of our initial business combination; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to either repay or issue units upon conversion of up to $500,000 of any working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week when we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
