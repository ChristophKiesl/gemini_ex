Item 1.  Business
Our History
 
Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Idaho on October 19, 1964, under the name Idaho Silver, Inc. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Florida Precision Aerospace, Inc., a Florida corporation ("FPA"), was incorporated on February 26, 1993.
General
 
The Company has developed, patented and manufactures the Voraxial® Separator ("Voraxial Separator" or "Voraxial"), a proprietary technology that efficiently separates large volumes of liquid/liquid, liquid/solids or liquid/liquid/solids fluid mixtures with distinct specific gravities. Management believes this superior separation quality is achieved in real-time, and in much greater volumes, with a more compact, cost effective and energy efficient machine than any comparable product on the market today. Management believes the Voraxial fills a void in the market; specifically a real-time separation device that separates a large volume of liquids with a small footprint and without the need of a pressure drop. We believe the need for such a separation device overlaps many markets. These benefits result in significant cost savings to the customer, both acquisition and operating cost.
 
The Voraxial is capable of processing volumes as low as 3 gallons per minute as well as volumes over 5,000 gallons per minute with only one moving part. The Company believes that the Voraxial technology can help protect the environment and its natural resources while simultaneously making numerous industries more productive and cost effective.
 
The separation of contaminants from water is needed in virtually every industry, either in the manufacturing or production side of the business or in purifying the wastewater prior to discharge. Because of the advantages the Voraxial Separator offers the end user, we believe the Voraxial can be used in many different markets. This allows the Company to develop different marketing strategies for different industries such as oil spill, mining, and municipal wastewater. The Company has focused its sales and marketing activity in the oil & gas exploration and production market, which also includes produced water, the tar sands, frac water, oil refineries and production facilities, and other liquid/liquid or liquid/solid applications for both offshore and onshore operations.
 
On March 13, 2017, we entered into a Technology Purchase Agreement with Schlumberger Technology Corporation, a Texas corporation, Schlumberger Canada Limited, a Canadian entity, and Schlumberger B.V., an entity organized under the laws of the Netherlands (collectively, the "Purchasers").
 
Under the agreement, subject to conditions to closing, we intend to sell our intellectual property, substantially consisting of our Voraxial patents, marks, software and copyrights, to the Purchasers in consideration of up to four million dollars ($4,000,000), of which three million dollars ($3,000,000) is payable at closing and one million dollars ($1,000,000) payable upon the completion of both 1) the complete transfer of the intellectually property to Purchasers and 2) the provision by the Company of transition information, assets and services to Purchasers, which is estimated to be approximately 12 months from the closing date. In addition, following the closing we shall receive a worldwide, royalty-free license from the Purchasers, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes embodying the intellectual property outside the oil-and-gas market.  In addition, the Company and the Purchasers, upon the closing of the agreement, shall enter into a supply agreement for certain manufacturing rights.
 
The agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this type. Each party's obligation to consummate the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and the condition that all representations and warranties, including a representation that no material adverse change has occurred, are true and correct on the date of closing as if made on such date. The agreement is subject to customary termination provisions and, in addition, may be terminated by the Company or the Purchasers if specified closing conditions have not been fulfilled by May 30, 2017, unless the terminating party has failed to comply with or perform its covenants and obligations in the agreement at the time of such termination.

In addition to the proceeds from the sale of our intellectual property, our management believes that the agreement will provide for the potential increase of revenues through the sale of Voraxial Separators to the Purchasers while enabling us the opportunity to possibly leverage future increased sales in the oil and gas market to penetrate the sale and use of licensed Voraxial products to other industries, including, but not limited to mining, sewage and wastewater. We are also entering into the agreement because of the historical and current challenges we have experienced in introducing the Voraxial products to the oil and gas market. 
 
Voraxial® Separator
 
The Voraxial Separator is a continuous flow turbo machine that generates a strong centrifugal force, a vortex, capable of separating light and heavy liquids, such as oil and water, or any other combination of liquids and solids at extremely high flow rates. As the fluid passes through the machine, the Voraxial Separator accomplishes this separation through the creation of a vortex. In liquid/liquid and liquid/solid mixtures, this vortex causes the heavier compounds to gravitate to the outside of the flow and the lighter elements to move to the center where an inner core is formed. The liquid stream processed by the machine is divided into separate streams of heavier and lighter liquids and solids. As a result of this process, separation is achieved.
 
The benefits of the Voraxial include:
 
 
- | High volume / small footprint
--+------------------------------


- | No Pressure drop requirement
--+-----------------------------


- | High G force
--+-------------


- | Treats a wide range of flows, even slugging flows
--+--------------------------------------------------


- | Handles fluctuation in flow rates without any adjustments
--+----------------------------------------------------------


- | Handles fluctuation in contaminates without any adjustments
--+------------------------------------------------------------


- | Separation of 2 or 3 components simultaneously
--+-----------------------------------------------


- | Non-clogging - open rotor assembly
--+-----------------------------------


- | Low maintenance with ease of operation and installation
--+--------------------------------------------------------


- | Can operate dry
--+----------------


- | Since there is no pressure drop, there is very little wear caused by sand
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Voraxial Separator is a self-contained, non-clogging device that can be powered by an electric motor, diesel engine or by hydraulic power generation. Further, the Voraxial Separator's scalability allows it to be utilized in a variety of industries and to process various amounts of liquid. The following are the various sizes and the corresponding capacity range:
 
 
Model | | Diameter | | Capacity Range 
----------+------+----------+----------+-------------------
Number | | Size | | Gallons Per Minute
Voraxial® | 1000 | | 1 inch | 3 | - 5 
Voraxial® | 2000 | | 2 inches | 20 | - 70 
Voraxial® | 4000 | | 4 inches | 100 | - 500 
Voraxial® | 8000 | | 8 inches | 1,000 | - 3,500



The Voraxial Separator can transfer various liquids in either direction by reversing the machine's rotation. We currently maintain an inventory of various models of the Voraxial Separator.
 
Management believes that our Voraxial Separator offers substantial applications on a cost-effective basis, including: oil exploration & production, oil remediation services, municipal wastewater treatment, bilge water purification, food processing waste treatment and numerous other industrial production and environmental remediation processes. We also believe that the quality of the water separated from the contaminant is good enough to recycle back into the process stream (back into the plant) or discharge to the environment. As clean water becomes less available to the ever-increasing world population, this technology may become more valuable.

The Market
 
The need for effective and cost efficient wastewater treatment and separation technology is global in scale. Moreover, virtually every industry requires some type of separation process either during the manufacturing process, prior to treatment or discharge of wastewater into the environment, for general clean up, or emergency response capability. Separation processes, however, are largely unknown to the average consumer. These processes are deeply integrated in almost all industrial processes from oil to wastewater to manufacturing. Management believes that the Voraxial technology has applications in most, if not all major separation industries. The unique characteristics of the Voraxial allow it to be utilized either as a stand-alone unit or within an existing system to provide a more efficient and cost effective way to handle the separation needs of the customer. We believe the Voraxial Separator can result in a cost savings and other benefits to the customer. These benefits result in and include:

● | A reduction in water and energy usage,
--+---------------------------------------


● | Requires no pressure drop to perform separation,
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Less space needed to implement the Voraxial Separator, the Voraxial Separator weights less than existing systems,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A reduction time to process and separate the fluids, allowing the customer to be more efficient,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Creation of more efficient and faster process to treat water to increase the overall productivity of the end-user,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fewer employees needed to operate the system, and
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Reduction of ongoing maintenance and servicing costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------



We believe that we are the only front-end solution for the separation industry that can offer increased productivity while reducing the physical space and energy required to operate the unit. These advantages translate into the potential for substantial operating cost efficiencies that would increase the profitability of the solution's end user. The Voraxial's unique characteristic to conduct separation without a pressure loss allows the unit to be installed in locations other technologies cannot. For instance another separation technology in the oil industry called a hydrocyclone requires a significant pressure loss to perform separation. We believe this characteristic gives our customers a more practical way to achieve separation.
 
If, as we expect, environmental regulations, both domestically and internationally, become more stringent, companies will be required to more effectively treat their wastewater prior to discharge. We believe this offers a great opportunity for the Company as the Voraxial Separator can be utilized in most separation applications to significantly increase the efficiency of the separation processes while simultaneously reduce the cost to the end-user.
 
Management believes that the oil industry, and more specifically the produced water market within this industry, represents a great opportunity for significant sales growth for the Voraxial Separator. The produced water market is worldwide and the need for effective produced water (oil/water) separation is a major issue for both offshore and land-based oil production facilities. The ability to efficiently separate produced water waste streams (oil and water) has enormous economical and environmental consequences for the oil production industry. Produced water comprises over 98% of the total waste volume generated by the oil and gas industry, making it the largest volume waste stream associated with oil and gas production.
 
Oil reservoirs frequently contain large volumes of water and as oil wells mature (the oil field becomes depleted), the amount of produced water increases. In the continental US, it is estimated that 7-10 barrels of water is produced for each barrel of recovered oil. According to the Argonne National Laboratory 2007 White Paper, "approximately 15 to 20 billion bbl (barrels; 1 bbl = 42 U.S. gallons) of produced water are generated each year in the United States. This is equivalent to a volume of 1.7 to 2.3 billion gallons per day." Worldwide, the total amount of produced water generated, excluding the United States, is approximately 50 billion barrels (approximately 6 billion gallons per day). Produced water volumes will continue to increase as oil wells mature.
 
The necessity to process and efficiently separate high volumes of liquids coupled with the more stringent environmental regulations worldwide is increasing the demand for the Voraxial Separator. The Voraxial Separator provides a cost effective way to separate large volumes of produced or re-injection water for both on-land and offshore production facilities. The Voraxial provides superior separation while decreasing the amount of space, energy and weight to conduct the separation. In addition to oil separation, the Voraxial can also perform solid (sand and grit) extraction, which prevents production damage by increasing the life of the well.
