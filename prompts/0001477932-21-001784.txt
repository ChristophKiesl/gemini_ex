Recent Developments
 
In mid-December Terra Tech experienced a significant change that began with the addition of three new Directors to the Company’s Board. This was the first step in a process that saw the addition of a new CEO and COO, the recapitalization of the company, the exiting of the founders of the company after ten years at the helm, and the retirement of our Preferred Stock. In December, Nicholas Kovacevich, Francis Knuettel II, and Ira Ritter joined the Board of Directors. Shortly thereafter Francis Knuettel II and Uri Kenig joined the Company as our Interim CEO and COO, respectively. The recapitalization provided the Company with working capital and a runway to expected cash inflows from asset sales and other investments, which are anticipated to make a significant impact on our balance sheet.
Pending Asset Sales
 
Wholly-owned subsidiaries of Terra Tech Corp entered into asset purchase agreements with non-affiliated third parties to sell the assets related to the Company’s Nevada dispensaries. These three transactions are pending, due to the fact that they are subject to approval by the Nevada Department of Taxation as well as local approval. After a year and a half delay, the transactions have been approved by the State of Nevada. We are now awaiting local government approval which has been impacted by COVID-19.The transactions are expected to close promptly following receipt of such approval.

The risks and uncertainties regarding the future of our business due to the impact of COVID-19 and regulatory uncertainty, combined with our historical lack of profitability, have in the past raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our management feels that proceeds due from its Hydrofarm investment, proceeds due from the Nevada asset sales, management’s past and on-going efforts to trim costs and management’s recent efforts to boost sales will lead to cash sustainability. Therefore management feels that there is no material uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Our Business
 
We are a retail, production and cultivation company, with an emphasis on providing the highest quality of medical and adult use cannabis products. We have a presence in two states (California and Nevada) . All of our cannabis dispensaries operate under the name Blüm. Our cannabis dispensaries in California operate as Blüm Oakland in Oakland and Blüm San Leandro in San Leandro and offer a broad selection of medical and adult-use cannabis products including flowers, concentrates and edibles. 
Business Update Regarding COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 outbreak has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting employers, employees, communities and business operations, as well as the world’s economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.
 
To date, we have been able to continue our operations and do not anticipate any material interruptions in the foreseeable future. However, we are continuing to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our industry and our company.
 
Marijuana Industry Overview
 
Marijuana cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as “buds.” The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ for other purposes such as hemp production and generally references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp.
 
Cannabis belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C. sativa (“Sativa”), C. indica (“Indica”), and C. ruderalis (“Ruderalis”). Sativa and Indica generally grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately four meters. The females produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC but is very rich in cannabidiol (“CBD”) and which is an antagonist (inhibits the physiological action) to THC.
 
As of December 2020, there are a total of 37 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have passed legislation as it relates to medicinal cannabis. Of these states, 15 have decriminalized adult use cannabis legislation. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently-accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision.
 
These 37 states, and the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different.

1. | Alaska | 13. | Maryland | 25. | North Dakota 
----+-------------+-----+---------------+-----+--------------
2. | Arizona | 14. | Massachusetts | 26. | Ohio

Medical cannabis decriminalization is generally referred to as the removal of all criminal penalties for the private possession and use of cannabis by adults, including cultivation for personal use and casual, nonprofit transfers of small amounts. Legalization is generally referred to as the development of a legally controlled market for cannabis, where consumers purchase from a safe, legal, and regulated source.
 
The dichotomy between federal and state laws has limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Treasury have issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, as banks can still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, there is widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws.
 
In November 2016, California and Nevada voters both approved marijuana use for adults over the age of 21 without a physician’s prescription or recommendation, and permitted the cultivation and sale of marijuana, in each case subject to certain limitations. We have obtained the necessary permits and licenses to expand our existing business to cultivate and distribute marijuana in compliance with the laws in the State of Nevada and California. Despite the changes in state laws, marijuana remains illegal under federal law.
 
In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which is also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“the AUMA”), in a ballot initiative. Among other things, the AUMA makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to 28.5 grams of marijuana flowers and 8 grams of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, the AUMA establishes a licensing system for businesses to, among other things, cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On January 1, 2018, the California Bureau of Marijuana Control enacted regulations to implement the AUMA.
 
Nevada voters approved Question 2 in a ballot initiative in November 2016. Among other things, Question 2 makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, Question 2 authorizes businesses to cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On June 30, 2017, the State of Nevada Department of Taxation approved our Dual-Use Marijuana business licenses. This approval allowed all of our Blüm cannabis dispensaries in Nevada to commence sales of cannabis for adult-use beginning on July 1, 2017. 
 
The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.

Since the start of the new Congress, there have been positive discussions about the Federal Government’s approach to cannabis. The new Biden administration has signaled a more pro-cannabis approach than the previous administration, however we’ve yet to see any definitive changes. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.
 
Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in California and Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Nevada and California laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
 
Our Medical Marijuana Dispensaries, Cultivation and Manufacturing 
 
Black Oak Gallery / Blüm Oakland / Hegenberger
 
On April 1, 2016, we acquired Black Oak, which operates a medical and adult use marijuana dispensary in Oakland, California under the name Blüm. Black Oak opened its retail storefront in Oakland, California in November 2012.
 
Black Oak sells a combination of our own cultivated products as well as high quality name-brand products from outside suppliers. In addition to multiple grades of medical and adult use marijuana, Black Oak sells “edibles”, which include cannabis-infused baked goods, chocolates, and candies; cannabis-infused topical products, such as lotions, massage oils and balms; clones of marijuana plants; and numerous kinds of cannabis concentrates, such as hash, shatter and wax.
 
Black Oak’s target markets are those individuals located in the areas surrounding its dispensary. Black Oak services approximately 250 consumers per day. Collectively known as the Blüm Campus, Black Oak’s location consists of a retail dispensary storefront, indoor cultivation area, a distribution area and a 20-car capacity parking lot.
 
During January 2017, we executed a lease for 13,000 square feet of industrial space on over 30,000 square feet of land in Oakland’s industrial corridor with the intention of building a cultivation facility, which we refer to as “the Hegenberger facility”. The Hegenberger facility is expected to be completed in the 3rd Quarter of 2021 and we will begin cultivating marijuana once all required operating permits are approved. 
 
Blüm San Leandro
 
We incorporated Blüm San Leandro on October 14, 2016. Blüm San Leandro has received the necessary governmental approvals and permitting to operate a medical and adult use marijuana dispensary and distribution facility in San Leandro, California. The San Leandro dispensary opened on January 11, 2019. The distribution facility is expected to be completed in mid-2021.
 
IVXX and IVXX Branded Products
 
On September 16, 2014, Terra Tech formed IVXX for the purposes of producing a line of IVXX branded cannabis flowers as well as a complete line of IVXX branded pure cannabis concentrates including: oils, waxes, shatters, and clears.
 
The science of cannabis concentrate extraction functions on the solubility of the cannabinoids and other active ingredients in the cannabis plant. Cannabinoids are not water soluble, so to extract them properly, the cannabinoids must be dissolved in a solvent. IVXX utilizes multiple proprietary extraction methods to produce its concentrates. The Company’s extractors process raw cannabis plants and separate the chemical cannabinoids from the cannabis plant material, producing a concentrate.

IVXX produces, markets and sells their line of IVXX branded cannabis products both to adult use and recreational cannabis markets in California and Nevada pursuant to Proposition 64 and Question 2, respectively, which made marijuana consumption legal (January 1, 2018 for California and July 1, 2017 for Nevada), with certain restrictions and rules, for adults over the age of 21.
 
On October 26, 2017, the Company entered into joint venture agreements with NuLeaf Sparks Cultivation, LLC and NuLeaf Reno Production, LLC (collectively “NuLeaf”) to build and operate cultivation and production facilities for our IVXX brand of cannabis products in Nevada. The agreements were subject to approval by the State of Nevada, the City of Sparks and the City of Reno in Nevada. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company remitted to NuLeaf an upfront investment of $4.50 million in the form of convertible loans bearing an interest rate of 6.0% per annum. The Company received all required permits and licenses from the State of Nevada and local authorities in 2018. As a result, the notes receivable balance was converted into a 50.0% ownership interest in Nuleaf. See Note 4— “Variable Interest Entity Arrangements”.
 
Carnegie 
 
On October 31, 2017, we formed Carnegie, a wholly owned subsidiary. Carnegie is a real estate holding company that owns the real property and a building located in Santa Ana, California. The Carnegie real estate was listed for sale in the fourth quarter of 2018. On July 30, 2020, we completed sold the real property and building located at 1815 Carnegie Avenue in Santa Ana, California to an unrelated third party. See Note 19 – “Discontinued Operations”.
 
Dyer 
 
On October 31, 2017, we formed Dyer, a wholly owned subsidiary. Dyer is a real estate holding company for the purpose of acquiring real property and a building located in Santa Ana, California, where the Company plans to open an additional cannabis operation in Santa Ana, California.
