ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company”. “we”, “us”, “our” and “our company” refer to Lazard Growth Acquisition Corp. I. Except where indicated, the information in this Form 10-K assumes that the company only has ordinary shares in issue.
 General
 We are a blank check company, incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (an “initial business combination”). Lazard Ltd and its subsidiaries (“Lazard” and, together with such subsidiaries, “Lazard Group”), an affiliate of our sponsor, LGACo 1 LLC (the “sponsor”), uses resources across its international financial advisory and asset management businesses to source and evaluate attractive, high growth private companies. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region in our identification and acquisition of a target company, we believe the growth-oriented subsectors of the healthcare, technology, energy transition, financial and consumer sectors present particularly attractive investment opportunities.
 On December 17, 2020, the sponsor paid an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.0017 per share, to subscribe for an aggregate of 14,375,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B ordinary shares” or “founder shares”). Up to 1,875,000 founder shares were subject to forfeiture by the sponsor, depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option was exercised. As a result of the underwriter’s exercise of the over-allotment option in full, 1,875,000 of the founder shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
 On February 12, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 57,500,000 of our units (the “units”), including 7,500,000 units sold upon exercise in full of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Class A ordinary shares” or “public shares”), and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant (the “public warrants”), with each whole public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $575,000,000.
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the issuance and sale of the units, the Company consummated the sale to the sponsor of 9,000,000 private placement warrants (the “private placement warrants”), with each private placement warrant exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating total proceeds of $13,500,000. The private placement warrants are identical to the public warrants, except that, so long as they are held by the sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) they will be entitled to registration rights.  
 A total of $575,000,000, comprised of $563,500,000 of the proceeds from the IPO and $11,500,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (the “trust account”). Transaction costs amounted to $32,476,988, consisting of $11,500,000 of underwriting fees (a net underwriting fee of $8,500,000 after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement of the Company for $3,000,000 of financial advisory fees payable by the Company to Lazard Frères & Co. LLC), $20,125,000 of deferred underwriting fees (as may be reduced as a result of the underwriter’s reimbursement to the Company for certain financial advisory fees payable by the Company to Lazard Frères & Co. LLC) and $851,988 of other offering costs. In addition, cash of $1,812,418 was held outside of the trust account and is available for working capital purposes and payment of IPO expenses.

Lazard currently operates from 41 cities in key business and financial centers across 26 countries throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and Central and South America. We believe we will be able to leverage Lazard’s proprietary network of relationships to help us source and consummate our initial business combination.
 Lazard is one of the world’s leading financial advisory firms and offers a wide array of services regarding mergers and acquisitions, capital structure, restructurings, shareholder advisory, sovereign advisory, capital raising and other strategic advisory matters.

 Lazard’s asset management business serves investors around the world with a broad range of global investment solutions and investment management services. Lazard has built the business over decades with an emphasis on strategies that benefit from intensive proprietary research and active management, and the result has been a strong pattern of long-term performance, global perspective and deep insight into local markets. Lazard’s asset management business offers a broad range of global investment solutions and investment management services in equity and fixed income strategies, asset allocation strategies, alternative investments and private equity funds.

 While Lazard’s employees are not our employees, we utilize Lazard’s scale and reach, including the reach of its professionals, as a source of potential opportunities for our initial business combination. Specifically, we leverage the following resources: 
  
• | Financial Advisory: Lazard has a distinctive network of deeply established relationships with meaningful insight and expertise across industry sectors and geographies. We have direct access to 179 managing directors in financial advisory across the globe, as well as other investment banking professionals, to identify opportunities in the areas that we deem appropriate and attractive for our initial business combination.

 Lazard prides itself on, and believes it differentiates itself from its competitors by, being able to offer a high level of attention from senior personnel to its clients.

 Our management team has extensive experience undertaking whole company and carve-out mergers and acquisitions, assessing IPO-readiness, overseeing business integrations, directing transformational growth strategies and identifying potential synergies. We believe that our management team is exceptionally capable of identifying attractive businesses, executing both whole company and carve-out acquisitions, and adding value post-deal completion. We believe our management team’s ability to identify and implement transformational growth and operational value creation initiatives are central to our differentiated acquisition strategy. Additionally, Lazard’s extensive global network of investment bankers, leading financial sponsor relationships and strong founder-led business track record enable us to pursue a broad range of attractive acquisition opportunities. Our network and affiliation with Lazard allows us to rely on an existing infrastructure of resources that assist in due diligence and, ultimately, structuring and executing an acquisition.
 Our Independent Directors 
 Our efforts to seek a suitable business combination target are, and will continue to be, complemented and augmented by the expertise and network of the relationships of our independent directors, Mr. Pierre-Yves Cros, Mr. Philip Hadley, Dr. Noreen Roth Henig and Ms. Selina Tobaccowala, each of whom has extensive experience in business and financial matters.
 For additional information regarding our independent directors, see Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance”.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our objective is to acquire a high-quality, growing business that can generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns for shareholders and negotiate favorable acquisition terms at a compelling valuation. To that end, our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, enhance the growth of a company in an industry that complements the experience and expertise of Lazard and our management team. Our selection process leverages Lazard’s and our management team’s extensive global network of relationships, deep knowledge across multiple industries and geographies, transaction execution experience and deal sourcing capabilities that provide access to a broad spectrum of acquisition opportunities. We believe Lazard’s distinguished reputation and vast network of institutional relationships differentiate us as a partner to growth companies. 
 We believe that the following differentiated value propositions will allow us to bring to the public market a highly attractive business: 
  
•Best-in-Class Sourcing Capabilities: Lazard’s preeminent global network of vast and deep relationships with CEOs, founders and private equity sponsors provides us with a proprietary avenue for sourcing target businesses. •Deep Insights across Sectors and Geographies: We believe that the extensive knowledge of Lazard and our management team across a multitude of industries and an understanding of economic and political nuances globally provide us with a differentiated ability to evaluate promising target businesses. •Proven Experience in Consummating Transactions: We believe that Lazard’s and our management team’s extensive mergers and acquisitions experience, with a distinct reputation for navigating transaction complexities, is a significant advantage. Lazard and our management team have demonstrated the ability to negotiate and structure transactions, evaluate corporate strategies, access growth capital and develop appropriate capital structures. •Extensive Understanding of Capital Markets and Public Market Investors: Lazard is a world-leading advisor to public company boards of directors and executives on matters of public markets, corporate strategy, shareholder engagement and ESG. We believe that the significant know-how of Lazard and our management team allows us to effectively gauge target companies that possess a readiness for being public, as well as to support their executives in the process of going public. •Significant Investment Experience: Lazard’s asset management business has extensive experience in analyzing attractive investments in individual equity opportunities as part of larger portfolios, including regularly evaluating and participating in IPOs, which have produced for its clients favorable risk-adjusted investment returns over long periods. We believe that Lazard’s proficiency in this area can help us evaluate compelling business combination opportunities.

Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region in our identification and acquisition of a target company, we believe the growth-oriented subsectors of the healthcare, technology, energy transition, financial and consumer sectors present particularly attractive investment opportunities for us. Lazard and our management team possess significant transactional experience in these industries, and many companies in these sectors tend to have significant and sustainable revenue and cash-flow growth rates. In addition to these fundamentals, these sectors are fragmented and contain a large number of privately-held and sponsor-owned businesses that we believe could benefit from accelerating revenue growth, expanding margins and deleveraging. In addition to independent privately- and sponsor-held businesses, we believe many public companies in these sectors are in the process of evaluating their portfolios of businesses and reviewing candidates for potential divestitures, which we believe may also prove to be attractive business combination targets.
 Our Acquisition Criteria
 Consistent with our acquisition and value creation strategy, we have developed the following high-level, non-exclusive investment criteria that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses: 

• | Large and Growing Addressable Market: A business with significant opportunity to capture market share in a large and growing addressable market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Differentiated Position: A business that holds a compelling strategic position in the industry in which it operates, with a differentiated product or service. Sources of differentiation may include: patents, brands, customer reputation or other intellectual property, unique technical expertise or personnel, innovative processes or proprietary sourcing or distribution or customer access.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant Future Growth Prospects: A business that has multiple, diverse potential drivers of revenue growth and that operates in sectors supported by secular tailwinds.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Attractive Prospective Return Profile: We view ourselves as rigorous, disciplined investors with a keen understanding of intrinsic and market valuations, as well as related potential risks. Accordingly, we are targeting businesses with attractive risk-return profiles and potential significant upside.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Committed and Capable Management Team: We are seeking to acquire a business with a professional management team whose interests are aligned with those of our investors. Where appropriate, we will enhance the capabilities of the target business’s management team by recruiting additional talent through Lazard’s network of contacts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as on other considerations, factors and criteria that our board of directors may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any of the above criteria, we will disclose that the target business does not meet all of our above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
 Our Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct, and expect to continue to conduct, a comprehensive due diligence review. That due diligence review may include, among other things, financial statement analysis, document reviews, meetings with the target’s management and other employees, consultations with relevant industry experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, as well as a review of additional information that we seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company.
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, a member of our management team or Lazard’s historical clients. In the event we seek to complete our 
 6


initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor or a member of our management team, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 Certain of our directors and officers presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 So long as our securities are then listed on the Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors intends to make the determination as to fair market value of our initial business combination. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board of directors is less familiar or experienced with the target business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects, including if such target is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. If our board of directors is unable to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 We may, at our option, subject to applicable law, pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with Lazard, one or more of Lazard’s historical clients, one or more entities affiliated with Lazard and/or one or more Lazard managed funds, separate accounts and other investment vehicles (“Lazard Funds”) and/or one or more investors in Lazard Funds, which we refer to as a “Joint Acquisition”. Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. We refer to this potential future issuance, or a similar issuance to other specified purchasers, as a “specified future issuance” throughout this Form 10-K. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B ordinary shares, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that our sponsor and other holders of our Class B ordinary shares would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of the IPO plus all Class A ordinary shares issued or deemed issued, or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued, or deemed issued in the specified future issuance (excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, deemed issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans), unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class B ordinary shares agreed to waive such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of our Class B ordinary shares at the time of any such specified future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class B ordinary shares, but would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our ordinary shares.
 7


We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. If our securities are not then listed on the Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test.
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 Corporate Information 
 Our executive offices are located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10112 and our telephone number is (212) 632-6000. We maintain a corporate website at https://lazardltd.gcs-web.com/lgacu. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered a part of, this Form 10-K.
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 30 years from December 14, 2020, no law which is thereafter enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
 We are also an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our 
 8


securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have taken advantage of, and intend to continue to take advantage of, the benefits of this extended transition period.
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the last business day of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
 Until the completion of our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the election of directors. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under the Nasdaq corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements. We have not utilized, and do not intend to utilize, these exemptions and intend to comply with the corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq, subject to applicable phase-in rules. However, we may determine in the future to utilize some or all of these exemptions.
