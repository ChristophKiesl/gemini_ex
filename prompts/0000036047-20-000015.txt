Item 1. Business
The Company
We are a leading global property information, analytics, data-enabled software platforms, and services provider operating in North America, Western Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our vision is to deliver unique property-level insights that power the global real estate economy. Our mission is to empower our clients to make smarter decisions through data-driven insights.
With our data as a foundation, we provide software platforms and value-added business services that address the unique needs of the mortgage, real estate, insurance, capital, public sector, and rental property markets. The quality of our software platforms and services is distinguished by our broad range of data assets and our experience in aggregating, organizing, normalizing, processing, and delivering data on a large-scale basis. Our structured property-specific data, consisting of over 150 million parcel records, covers 99% of the United States ("US"), includes both residential and commercial real estate data and is enriched by over 1 billion historical sales, mortgage, and pre-foreclosure transactions. Our consortium data covers loan level mortgage performance, appraisal, as well as mortgage application data and is in excess of 300 million records. We are also the industry's first parcel-based geocoder and have developed a proprietary spatial database covering more than 150 million parcel polygons across the US. These databases enable our clients to access detailed property insights, current and historical mortgage data, involuntary property liens and encumbrances, building construction and replacement costs, consumer credit, tenancy, location intelligence, hazard, and other natural risk factors as well as mortgage risk and portfolio performance data.
We have more than one million end-users who rely on our data and predictive decision analytics to reduce risk, enhance transparency, and improve the performance of their businesses.
We offer our clients a comprehensive national database covering real property and mortgage information, judgments and liens, building and replacement costs, parcel and geospatial data, criminal background records, eviction information, non-prime lending records, credit information, and tax information, among other data types. Using these robust datasets, we have built strong value-added analytical capabilities and business services to meet our clients’ needs for property tax processing, property valuation, mortgage and automotive credit reporting, tenancy screening, hazard risk, property risk and replacement cost, flood plain location determination, geospatial data, analytics, and related services.
We became a stand-alone public company on June 1, 2010, when we completed a transaction in which we separated from the financial services businesses of our predecessor company, The First American Corporation ("FAC") (referred to as the "Separation"). To effect the Separation, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement (“Separation and Distribution Agreement”) that governs the rights and obligations of us and First American Financial Corporation ("FAFC") regarding the distribution. It also governs the on-going relationship between us and FAFC subsequent to the completion of the Separation and provides for the allocation of assets and liabilities between us and FAFC. In addition, we also entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement (“Tax Sharing Agreement”) with FAC and FAFC. FAC was incorporated in California in 1894, and as part of the Separation, we reincorporated in Delaware on June 1, 2010, changed our name to CoreLogic, Inc. and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CLGX.” As used herein, the terms "CoreLogic," the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to CoreLogic, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, except where it is clear that the terms mean only CoreLogic, Inc. and not our subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 40 Pacifica, Irvine, California, 92618-7471, our telephone number is (949) 214-1000, and our website is www.corelogic.com.
Corporate Events
Dividend
In December 2019, we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders. CoreLogic paid a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock on January 24, 2020 to shareholders of record on the close of business January 10, 2020. 
Business Exits & Transformation 
In December 2018, we announced our intent to exit a loan origination software unit and its remaining legacy default management related platforms, as well as accelerate an appraisal management company ("AMC") transformation program. We believe these actions will expand our overall profit margins and provide for enhanced long-term organic growth trends. In September 2019, we divested our default management related platforms and received proceeds of $3.8 million. The AMC 
 3

transformation was concluded in December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, operating revenues decreased by $61.9 million attributable to the aforementioned business exists and strategic transformation compared to 2018. We also recorded non-cash impairment charges of $47.8 million and severance expense of $5.3 million in 2019 relating to the AMC transformation program.
Acquisitions
We opportunistically acquire companies, businesses, products, and services to grow market share in the mortgage, real estate, insurance, capital, public sector, and rental property markets. We also identify opportunities that complement our strengths and/or diversify our exposure from the mortgage and real estate market.
During 2019, we completed the acquisition of National Tax Search, LLC ("NTS") for total net cash of approximately $13.2 million. This acquisition included contingent consideration of up to $7.5 million to be paid in cash by 2022, contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. NTS is a leading provider of commercial property tax payment services and specializes in identifying potential collateral loss related to unpaid property tax, homeowner's association fees, and inaccurate flood zone determinations. The NTS acquisition increases the Company's commercial property tax offerings and is expected to drive future growth in the US. See Note 17 - Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Financing Activities
In May 2019 we amended our credit agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent and other financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.8 billion five-year term loan facility (the "Term Facility"), and a $750.0 million five-year revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"). The Term Facility matures, and the Revolving Facility expires, in May 2024. The Revolving Facility includes a $100.0 million multicurrency revolving sub-facility and a $50.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for the ability to increase the Term Facility and Revolving Facility by up to $300.0 million in the aggregate; however, the lenders are not obligated to do so. See Note 8 - Long Term Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Technology Transformation
In September 2018, we announced the adoption of the Google Cloud Platform ("GCP") as a foundational element of our ongoing technology transformation program to further expand infrastructure capabilities and drive efficiencies. We expect to complete the initial deployment of GCP over the next 12 months. Once implemented, CoreLogic plans to leverage the capabilities of the cloud platform to achieve best-in-class system performance and reliability and to facilitate the deployment of unique business insights fueled by gold-standard data, information, and analytics. Additionally, we expect to realize significant cost efficiencies and enhanced security upon implementation.
Our Data
Our data is the foundation of many of our products, platforms, and services, and can generally be categorized as property information, mortgage information, and consumer information. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including but not limited to, data gathered from public sources, data contributed by our clients, and data obtained from other industry leading data aggregators.
We gather a variety of data from public sources, including electronic data and documents from federal, state, and local governments and enhance this information through advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, leveraging data we collect from non-public sources. This allows us to create comprehensive textual and geospatial views of each property within our coverage areas, including physical property characteristics, boundaries and tax values, current and historical ownership, voluntary and involuntary liens, tax assessments and delinquencies, replacement cost, property risk including environmental, flood, and hazard information, criminal data, building permits, local trends, and nationwide summary statistics.
Specific agreements exist which govern data contributed to our consortium data assets by our clients. These contractual arrangements provide the necessary permissions to enable us to deliver solutions across several vertical markets using the client contributed data. We structure end-user agreements to consortium data solutions to acknowledge the specific uses of the data and to provide the required levels of data privacy and protection for the consortium contributors’ data. Consortium data 
 4

includes loan performance information, appraisal information, information regarding property rental and under-banked loan applications, and rental property information.
We gather property listing and tenant/landlord rental information from Boards of Realtors®, real estate agents, brokers, landlords, and owners of multi-tenant properties. We acquire appraisal and property valuation from appraisers, and license consumer credit history information from nationwide credit reporting agencies.
Business Segments
We have organized our business into the following two segments: Property Intelligence & Risk Management Solutions ("PIRM") and Underwriting & Workflow Solutions ("UWS"). 
We believe that we hold the leading market position for many of our solutions, including:

• | property tax processing, based on the number of loans under service;


• | flood zone determinations, based on the number of flood zone certification reports issued;


• | credit and income verification services to the US mortgage lending industry, based on the number of credit reports issued;


• | property valuation and technology platform solutions, based on the number of in-house staff appraisers and inquiries received; and


• | multiple listing services ("MLS"), based on the number of active desktops using our technology.

In addition to our two reporting segments, we also have a corporate group, which bears costs and expenses not allocated to our segments. More detailed financial information regarding each of our business segments is included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as Note 18 - Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of Part II of this report.
Solutions
Property Intelligence & Risk Management Solutions
Our PIRM segment delivers unique housing market and property-level insights, predictive analytics, and risk management capabilities. We have also developed proprietary technology and software platforms to access, automate, and track this information, as well as assist our clients with decision-making and compliance tools in the real estate industry, insurance industry, and the single and multifamily industry. We deliver this information directly to our clients in a standard format over the web, through hosted software platforms or in bulk data form. Our solutions include property insights and insurance and spatial solutions in North America, Western Europe, and Asia Pacific. 
Our property insights combine our patented predictive analytics with our proprietary and contributed data to enable our clients to improve customer acquisition and retention, detect and prevent fraud, improve mortgage transaction cycle time and cost efficiency, identify real estate trends and neighborhood characteristics, track market performance, and increase market share. Our data is comprised of real estate information, incorporating crime, site inspection, neighborhood, document images, and other information from proprietary sources. We also offer verification of applicant income, identity, and employment services using Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and Social Security Administration databases, as well as third-party employment data providers. Further, we maintain the leading market share of real estate listing software systems, with provisioning to more than 50% of all US and Canadian real estate agents. We also provide a full range of professional services to listing organizations and assist our clients in identifying revenue opportunities and improving member services.
Our insurance and spatial solutions provide property and casualty insurers, energy, and other markets the ability to more effectively locate, assess, and manage property-level assets and risks through location-based data, property content, proprietary workflow solutions, and analytics. In addition to the industry's first parcel-based geocoder and an industry-leading parcel database covering more than 150 million parcels across the US, we maintain critical and up-to-date information across multiple hazard databases including information on storm, land-based, fire, and even non-weather-related hazards. 
Underwriting & Workflow Solutions
Our UWS segment provides comprehensive mortgage origination and monitoring solutions, including underwriting-related solutions and data-enabled valuations and appraisals. We have also developed proprietary technology and software platforms to access, automate, and track this information, as well as assist our clients with vetting and on-boarding prospects, meeting 
 5

compliance regulations, and understanding, evaluating, and monitoring property values. Our UWS solutions include property tax solutions, valuation solutions, credit solutions, and flood data solutions in North America.
Our property tax solutions are built from aggregated property tax information from over 20,000 taxing authorities. We use this information to advise mortgage originators and servicers of the property tax payment status of loans in their portfolio and to monitor that status over the life of the loans. If a mortgage lender requires tax payments to be impounded on behalf of its borrowers, we can also monitor and oversee the transfer of these funds to the taxing authorities and provide the lender with payment confirmation.
Our valuations solutions represent property valuation-related, data-driven services, and analytics combined with collateral valuation workflow technologies, which assist our clients in assessing risk of loss using both traditional and alternative forms of property valuation, driving process efficiencies, and ensuring compliance with lender and governmental regulations. We have been building collateral risk management models for more than 20 years and provide collateral information technology and solutions that automate property appraisal ordering, tracking, documentation, and review for lender compliance with government regulations.
Our credit solutions have access to one of the largest consumer and business databases, which enables us to provide credit, income, and employment verification services to the mortgage and automotive industries. We provide comprehensive information about credit history, income verification, and home address history. We normalize our data to provide a broad range of advanced business information solutions designed to reduce risk and improve business performance.
Our flood data solutions provide flood zone determinations in accordance with the US Federal legislation passed in 1994, which requires that most mortgage lenders obtain a determination of the current flood zone status at the time each loan is originated and obtain applicable updates during the life of the loan. We provide flood zone determinations primarily to mortgage lenders.
Clients
Our clients are predominantly financial services institutions in the mortgage and insurance industries. We provide our solutions to national and regional mortgage lenders, servicers, brokers, credit unions, commercial banks, investment banks, fixed-income investors, real estate agents, MLS companies, property management companies, real estate investment trusts, property and casualty insurance companies, government agencies, and government-sponsored enterprises.
Our more significant client relationships tend to be long-term in nature and we typically provide a number of different solutions to each client. Because of the depth of these relationships, we derive a significant portion of our aggregate revenue from our largest clients, with 29.8% of our 2019 operating revenues being generated by our ten largest clients. None of our clients individually accounted for greater than 10% of our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Competition
We offer a diverse array of specialized products and services that compete directly and indirectly with similar products and services offered by national and local providers. We believe there is no single competitor who offers the same combination of products and services that we do. Therefore, we believe that we compete with a broad range of entities.
Our PIRM segment competes with entities that provide access to data or data-based analytics products and services as part of their product offerings, including Black Knight, Inc., which provides real estate information, analytics, valuation-related services, and other solutions; ATTOM Data, which provides public records data; FAC, which provides real estate, home ownership and property data; Verisk Analytics, Inc., which provides data and risk assessment in the insurance and financial services industries, as well as RealPage, Inc. and Yardi Systems, Inc., which provide services in the multifamily residential industry. We also compete with departments within financial institutions that utilize internal resources to provide similar analytics and services on a captive basis. We compete based on the breadth and quality of our data sets, the exclusive nature of some of our key data sets, the quality and effectiveness of our products, and the integration of our platforms into client systems. We believe the data we offer is distinguished by quality, the broad range of our data sources (including non-public sources), the volume of records we maintain, and our ability to provide data spanning a historical period of time that exceeds comparable data sets of most of our competitors.
Our UWS segment competes with third-party providers such as Black Knight, Inc. and Lereta LLC, which provide tax and flood solutions, as well as credit and screening solutions providers such as Equifax, Inc., Credit Plus, Kroll Factual Data, Clear Capital, Solidifi, and ServiceLink, which provide valuation-related services. For these services, we compete largely based on 
 6

the quality of the products and services we provide, our ability to provide scalable services at competitive prices, and our ability to provide integrated platforms. We also compete with departments within financial institutions that utilize internal resources to provide similar services on a captive basis. We generally compete with captive providers based on the quality of our products and services, the scalability of our services, cost efficiencies, and our ability to provide some level of risk mitigation.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales strategy is client-focused, and resources are primarily assigned based on client size and complexity. Several of our sales team members and subject matter experts specialize in specific solutions, products, and services. Each of our sales executives develops and maintains key relationships within each client’s business units and plays an important role in relationship management as well as developing new business. Our sales executives understand the current marketplace environment and demonstrate extensive knowledge of our clients’ internal operating structure and business needs. The depth and breadth of our relationships with our clients allows us to develop and implement solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of each client in a prompt and efficient manner.
Smaller clients, measured by revenue or geographic coverage, are primarily managed through our inside sales operations function which is responsible for working with mortgage and real estate brokers, smaller property and casualty insurance companies, fixed-income investors, appraisers, real estate agents, correspondents, and other lenders.
Several of our product and service lines have sales teams and subject matter experts who specialize in specific solutions, products, and services. These sales teams and subject matter experts work collaboratively with our sales executives and our inside sales operations to assist with client sales by combining our data, products, and data-enabled services to meet the specific needs of each client and may be assigned to assist with sales in targeted markets for certain categories of clients or for particular service groups.
Our marketing strategy is to accelerate growth by building trusted relationships with our clients and delivering superior value through unique property-related data, analytics, and data-enabled solutions. We use the most efficient methods available to successfully identify, target, educate, and engage potential and existing clients through their preferred channel of communication. Employing client-centric marketing initiatives and campaigns, we clearly articulate our value proposition to build awareness, familiarity and interest in our business solutions, demand for our products and services, as well as increase volume, quality, and velocity of sales opportunities. Our marketing activities include direct marketing, advertising, public relations, event marketing, digital marketing, social media, and other targeted activities.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Historically, we have increased the scale of our existing businesses and entered new markets, products, and services through selective acquisitions that we believe strengthen our overall solution offerings and value proposition to clients. We continually evaluate our business mix and opportunistically seek to optimize our business portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures.
Intellectual Property
We own significant intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret, and patent) and contractual safeguards in an intellectual property enforcement program to protect our intellectual property rights.
We have more than 50 issued patents in the US covering business methods, software, and systems patents, principally relating to automated valuation, fraud detection, data gathering, flood detection, MLS technology, and property monitoring. We also have at least 19 patent applications pending in these and other areas in the US. In addition, we have a number of issued patents and pending patent applications internationally, including in Canada and Australia. The protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success and we intend to continue to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and are material to our business.
In addition, we own more than 300 trademarks in the US and foreign countries, including the names of our products and services as well as our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered. Many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos are material to our business, as they assist our clients in identifying our products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
 7

We own more than 1,000 registered and unregistered copyrights in the US and foreign countries, covering computer programs, reports, and manuals. We also have other literary works, including marketing materials, handbooks, presentations, and website content that are protected under common law copyright. We believe our written materials are essential to our business as they provide our clients with insight into various areas of the financial and real estate markets in which we operate.
Our research and development activities focus primarily on the design and development of our analytical tools, software applications, and data sets. We expect to continue our practice of investing in the development of new software applications and systems in response to the market and client needs we identify through client input collected in meetings, phone calls, and web surveys. We also assess opportunities to integrate existing data sets to enhance our products' effectiveness. 
In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into license agreements with our clients, granting rights to use our products and services, including our software and databases. We also audit our clients from time to time to ensure compliance with our agreements. This helps to maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions. As a general practice, employees, contractors, and other parties with access to our proprietary information enter into agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information, and technology.
Information Technology
Information technology is a significant focus area and we maintain a long-term strategic technology plan which is reassessed annually. Our existing technology infrastructure is a private, dedicated cloud-based computing environment hosted in primary and secondary technology centers owned and managed by the NTT Data Corporation ("NTT"). Additionally, we have begun the process of modernizing a number of our legacy solutions to take full advantage of the dynamic scaling offered by the Google Cloud Platform using the Pivotal Cloud Foundry ("PCF") Platform as a Service ("PaaS") capability to ensure we maintain the flexibility to operate our products and services on any public cloud platform in the future.
We maintain an innovation development center ("IDC") to develop, enhance and expand our next generation cloud-agnostic IDC platform on which new products can be rapidly built, scaled, modified, and deployed. In addition, the IDC plays a leading role in research and development in the areas of employing hardware advancements, data and analytics, mobility, voice, and the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning ("AI/ML"). We supplement the IDC with a number of strategic alliances.
Technology Operations
In conjunction with NTT and Google, we operate a computing technology environment intended to allow us to provide flexible systems at all times, enabling us to deliver increased capacity as needed or when client needs demand increased speed of delivery. Our current mainstream private, dedicated cloud computing environment hosted by NTT is designed to enable us to deliver secure and compliant data, analytics, and services to support client needs. We have also completed the development of an advanced cloud operating model that provides a fully automated, tightly controlled, and highly secured environment for the products and services we will be operating on GCP as we transition to the Google public cloud. This network of systems, combined with enterprise-level service operations, positions us as a leading property insights provider to the financial services market. Our platforms store, process, and deliver our data and proprietary technologies that are the foundation of our business and critical to the development of our solutions. Additionally, our unified network architecture allows us to operate multiple systems as a single resource capable of delivering subsets of our applications, data, and analytics as compelling combined solutions to our clients.
Security
Leveraging the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Cybersecurity Framework, we have deployed a wide range of physical and digital security measures, along with a formal governance program to protect the security of our information technology infrastructure, personnel, and data. Our security team is responsible for establishing corporate information security policies, performing 24/7 security operations, maintaining information security awareness, and ensuring enterprise IT compliance. Both our technology managers and NTT’s technology infrastructure managers are Information Technology Infrastructure Library ("ITIL") certified. NTT is contractually obligated to comply with our information security policies and procedures, and our new cloud operating model that we use for those products and services that have already been refactored to operate on GCP automatically enforces compliance with our information security policies. Our digital security framework for both our NTT and GCP computing environments provides layered protection designed to secure both active and inactive virtual machines in the data centers we use. This approach enables dedicated virtual machines to regularly scan all of our systems. These measures help to detect and prevent intrusions, monitor firewall integrity, inspect logs, catch and quarantine malware, 
 8

and prevent data breaches. Our physical and digital security solutions run in tandem, enabling us to better identify suspicious activities and implement preventive measures
Regulation
We are subject to a number of US federal, state and local, and foreign laws and regulations that involve various aspects of our businesses. Failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to provide certain products and services or could result in the imposition of fines or penalties or the incurrence of damages. US federal, state and local, and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the US Congress, various state legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning consumer and data protection that could affect us. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. These laws are enforced by regulatory agencies or other enforcement bodies in the jurisdictions where we operate and, in some instances, also through private civil litigation. Among the more significant areas of regulation for our business are the following:
US Consumer Financial Regulations and Data Protection
Our US operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the collection, protection and use of consumer data and other information, and provide for sanctions for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data. The laws and regulations that affect our US operation include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”). The FCRA governs the practices of consumer reporting agencies that are engaged in the business of collecting and analyzing certain types of information about consumers, including credit eligibility information. The FCRA also governs the submission of information to consumer reporting agencies, the access to and use of information provided by consumer reporting agencies, and the ability of consumers to access and dispute information held about them. Some of our services are subject to regulation under the FCRA. Violation of the FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties and the FCRA contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual or class action lawsuits for violations of the FCRA. Regulatory enforcement of the FCRA is under the purview of the US Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with one another. Many states have also enacted laws with requirements similar to the FCRA. Some of these state laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than the FCRA.


• | Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act gave the CFPB supervisory authority over “larger participants” in the market for consumer financial services, as the CFPB defines by rule. In July 2012, the CFPB finalized its regulation regarding larger participants in the consumer reporting market. Under the regulation, certain of our credit services businesses are considered larger participants. As a result, the CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations of the covered credit services businesses and we expect that we will continue to be examined by the CFPB as part of this authority. In addition, the CFPB serves as the principal federal regulator of providers of consumer financial products and services. As such, the CFPB has significant rulemaking authority under existing federal statutes that regulate many of our products and services, as well as the authority to conduct examinations of certain providers of financial products and services, including our tax services business. The CFPB also has the authority to initiate an investigation of our other businesses if it believes that a federal consumer financial law is being violated. In addition to transferring authority under certain existing laws to the CFPB and providing it with examination and supervisory authority, the Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) with respect to consumer financial products and provides the CFPB with authority to enforce those provisions. The CFPB has stated that its UDAAP authority may allow it to find statutory violations even where a specific regulation does not prohibit the relevant conduct, or prior published regulatory guidance or judicial interpretation has found the activity to be in accordance with law.


• | Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA"). The GLBA regulates the sharing of non-public personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions. In addition to regulating information sharing, the GLBA requires that non-public personal financial information be safeguarded using physical, administrative, and technological means. Certain of the non-public personal information we hold is subject to protection under the GLBA.


• | Privacy Laws. The privacy and protection of consumer information remains a developing area and we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments at the federal, state, and local levels. In addition to the GLBA, we expect that there will continue to be enhanced state and/or federal regulation in the area of financial and consumer data privacy, including regulation similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). Such regulation may impose additional registration

 9

requirements and/or require us to make new disclosures to consumers about our data collection, use, and sharing practices and afford consumers new abilities to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Any such additional regulation could significantly impact some of our business practices. 

• | Data Security. Federal and state laws also impose requirements relating to the security of information held by us. For our businesses that involve the collection, processing, and distribution of personal public and non-public data, certain of their solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state, and local laws in the US and, to a lesser extent, foreign countries. These laws impose requirements regarding the collection, protection, use, and distribution of some of the data we have, and provide for sanctions and penalties in the event of violations of these requirements. In addition, certain state laws may impose breach notice responsibilities in the event of the loss of data due to third-party security breaches, employee error, or other events resulting in persons gaining unauthorized access to our data (including, in some cases, for losses that are incurred through our clients’ errors or systems). Some of these laws require additional data protection measures over and above the GLBA data safeguarding requirements. If data within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws. All states have adopted data security breach laws that require notice be given to affected consumers in the event of a breach of personal information, and in some cases the provision of additional benefits such as free credit monitoring to affected individuals. In addition, the CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action under certain circumstances if their personal information is subject to a breach. If data within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of these various state security breach laws.


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”). RESPA is enforced by the CFPB and generally prohibits the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of real estate-related settlement services. RESPA also prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services, such as mortgage brokerage services and real estate brokerage services. Notwithstanding these prohibitions, RESPA permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed, so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided. Our mortgage origination-related businesses that supply credit reports, flood and tax solutions, valuation products, and all other settlement services to residential mortgage lenders are structured and operated in a manner intended to comply with RESPA and related regulations.


• | Real estate appraisals and automated valuation models (“AVMs”) are subject to federal and state regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented rules and guidance thereunder, and inter-agency guidance jointly issued by the federal financial institution regulators have expanded regulation of these activities. Regulations address appraisals, AVMs, and other forms of property value estimates, which are subject to explicit and detailed regulations including licensing, pricing, and quality control requirements. In addition, creditors are required to disclose information to applicants about the purpose, and provide consumers with a free copy, of any appraisal, AVM or other estimate of a home's value developed in connection with a residential real estate mortgage loan application.

In addition to the foregoing areas of regulation, several of our other businesses are subject to or impacted by additional regulation, including our tenant screening business, which is subject to certain landlord-tenant laws and insurance agency laws, and our activities in foreign jurisdictions are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and comparable foreign laws.
International Consumer Financial Regulations and Data Protection
We are subject to consumer and data protection laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we conduct business. We conduct business in several international jurisdictions, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, and various countries in Europe. Principal regulatory bodies and regulatory laws that impact our international operations include the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the agency with direct responsibility for administering the Australian Privacy Principles and Part IIIA of the Privacy Act 1988, and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of New Zealand, which issued the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2004. We are also subject to the European Union Data Protection Regulation, commonly known as GDPR, which places certain obligations on companies processing and controlling data on individuals in the EU and prohibits the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. In Canada, we are subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000, as well as substantially similar provincial laws enacted in Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec. In addition to the above-mentioned regulations, we are subject to a variety of international consumer protection, privacy, data security and notification laws and regulations in each foreign jurisdiction in which we operate that may relate to our business or affect the demand for our products and services.
 10

Compliance with current and future laws and regulations relating to our businesses, including consumer protection laws and regulations and international regulations, could have a material adverse effect on us and activities related to ongoing compliance will likely increase our compliance costs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 5,100 employees, of which approximately 4,200 were employed in the US and 900 outside the US.
