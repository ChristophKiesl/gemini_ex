 Item 1.  Business.
 ﻿
 We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on August 22, 1989.  We are in the business of innovating fundamental wireless technologies.  We design, develop and market proprietary radio frequency (“RF”) technologies for use in wireless communication products including our own internally developed products. We have expended significant financial and other resources to research and develop our RF technologies and to obtain patent protection for those technologies in the United States (“U.S.”) and certain foreign jurisdictions.  We believe certain patents protecting our proprietary technologies have been broadly infringed by others and therefore our business plan includes enforcement of our intellectual property rights through patent infringement litigation and licensing efforts.
 ﻿
 Based on the manner in which our management views and evaluates our operations, we have determined that our business currently operates under a single operating and reportable segment.  Refer to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for financial data including net losses from operations and total assets.    ﻿

Recent Developments
 ﻿
 Termination of ITC Proceedings
 In January 2016, the  U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) instituted an investigation against  Apple, Inc. (“Apple”), LG (LG Electronics, Inc., LG Electronics U.S.A., Inc., and LG Electronics MobileComm U.S.A., Inc.), Samsung (Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Samsung Electronics America, Inc., and Samsung Semiconductor, Inc.) and Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm”) based on a complaint we filed in December 2015 alleging that these companies have engaged in unfair trade practices by unlawfully importing into the U.S. and selling various products that infringe certain of our patent claims.  For expediency, we later narrowed the proceedings to a single patent.  Our complaint requested that the ITC bar the defendants from continuing to import and sell infringing products in the U.S.  We filed a corresponding patent infringement complaint in the Middle District of Florida against these same defendants. The district court case was stayed pending the outcome of the ITC proceedings.  On March 13, 2017, the date the ITC hearing was scheduled to commence, we filed a motion to terminate the ITC proceedings as a result of a pre-trial ruling that precluded us from presenting key evidence in our case. Termination of the ITC proceedings will allow us to request the removal of the stay on the corresponding proceedings in district court.  The ITC has not yet ruled on our motion to withdraw.       At Market Issuance Sales Agreement
 On December 30, 2016, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with FBR Capital Markets & Co. (“FBR”) for the sale of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $10 million.  From January through March 2017, we sold an aggregate of 4.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $2.46 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $10 million.   Shares sold under the ATM Agreement were issued pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-214598) filed with the SEC in November 2016 and a prospectus supplement dated December 30, 2016. We intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM Agreement for research and development, sales and marketing activities, and for other working capital and general corporate purposes.  
 ﻿
 Nasdaq Compliance
 On January 19, 2017, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) stating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the market value of our listed securities (“MVLS”) had been below the minimum of $35 million required for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). The notification letter stated that we would be afforded 180 calendar days, or until July 18, 2017 to regain compliance.  In order to regain compliance, our MVLS must remain at or above $35 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.  The notification letter also states that in the event we do not regain compliance within the 180 day period, our securities may be subject to delisting.  In the event we receive a delisting determination, we may appeal that determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel.

General Development of Business  
 ﻿
 Our business has been primarily focused on the development, marketing and licensing of our RF technologies for mobile and other wireless products and applications, including our own internally developed end-user wireless products. Our technologies represent among other things, unique, proprietary methods for processing RF waveforms in wireless applications. Our technologies apply to both transmit and receive functions of transmitters, receivers, and transceivers as well as other related RF communications functions. A portion of our transmit technology is marketed as Direct2Power™, or d2p™, and enables the transformation of a baseband data signal to an RF carrier waveform, at the desired RF power output level, in a single unified operation. A portion of our receiver technology is marketed as Direct2Data™, or d2d™, and enables the direct conversion of an RF carrier to a baseband data signal, as well as enabling the direct conversion of a baseband signal to a modulated RF carrier signal.  This technology is also referred to as energy transfer sampling down conversion and/or pulse-shaping up conversion.  We have developed these and a number of additional innovations which are protected by the intellectual property we have secured in various patent families for RF and related functions in RF-based communications.
 ﻿
 Prior to 2005, our business was primarily focused on our direct conversion transceiver technology. Our business plan included efforts to license the technology as well as the development and sale of retail wireless networking products that incorporated the technology.  In 2005, we exited our retail business activities in order to better focus on our licensing efforts and on product and component development, manufacturing and sales. This strategy coincided with the introduction of a new family of wireless technologies, the transmit, or d2p, technology family. Our primary target market became the mobile handset industry and over the next several years we focused our marketing and sales efforts within this industry.
 ﻿
 From 2007 through 2013, we partnered with VIA Telecom, Inc. (“VIA”), a CDMA baseband provider, on a CDMA-based transceiver product.  We initially entered into a licensing and engineering services agreement with VIA which allowed VIA a royalty-based license to manufacture devices based on our technology and also preserved our right to manufacture and sell such devices ourselves to third parties. By 2009, VIA had not manufactured any royalty-producing devices under this agreement, and we began working with VIA on the joint development of reference platforms that incorporated our RF products and VIA’s baseband processors without the exchange of intellectual property rights.  We also worked with VIA to co-develop a sample 3G mobile handset which verified our technology in a working implementation and tested our technology’s performance. The results of these efforts were utilized to market our product to VIA’s customers.  From 2010 through 2013, we modified our circuit layout and packaging to meet design requirements of specific VIA customers.  In 2013, we entered into a formal development agreement with VIA whereby we compensated VIA for their development and ongoing support and maintenance of the custom interfaces between our products for a specific customer.  In 2014, we terminated our formal development agreement with VIA prior to VIA’s completion of the interface to its latest model baseband processor due to the uncertainty of the specific customer’s future use of the VIA baseband in its products.  VIA subsequently sold its CDMA-based mobile assets, including its baseband processors, to Intel Corporation (“Intel”) in 2015.

Our lack of tenure in the mobile handset industry coupled with the unique nature of our technology resulted in lengthy and intense technology evaluation and due diligence efforts by potential customers. Furthermore, in order to utilize our technology in a mobile handset application, we were reliant upon the provider of the baseband processor that generates the data to be transmitted or received by our RF chipsets.  Although our technology is capable of interfacing with any baseband processor, the development of the interface between the baseband processor and our chipset requires a cooperative effort with the baseband provider. Accordingly, our marketing efforts were dependent on the activities of third parties. In addition, we believe our technology has been broadly infringed by others thereby reducing the competitive advantage of our technologies. We believe these factors hindered our sales efforts, particularly in the mobile handset market.
 ﻿
 In 2011, through analysis of conference papers and tear down reports, we concluded that Qualcomm’s products were infringing our energy transfer sampling down conversion technology.  Based on our belief that our technology is widely-deployed in the mobile handset market as a result of infringement of our patents, we began to more vigorously pursue an intellectual property licensing strategy which included enforcement actions. We filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Qualcomm in July 2011 (the “Qualcomm I Action”).  Although this case resulted in a $173 million jury award in 2013 for Qualcomm’s infringement of several of our patents, the jury decision was ultimately overturned by the district court judge, a decision that was later upheld on appeal.  Despite the courts’ decisions in the Qualcomm I Action, we continue to believe that certain of our technologies are broadly infringed and have wide-spread application in the industry.  From 2014 through 2016, we pursued licensing opportunities for our technologies, including through additional litigation where we deemed necessary to protect our patent rights.  These efforts resulted in a patent license and settlement agreement with Samsung in 2016.  See “Legal Proceedings” in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a full discussion of our patent-related litigation activities.          In 2016, we received an aggregate of $13 million in funding from Brickell Key Investments (“BKI”), the majority of which was designated for the payment of legal fees and expenses in connection with certain patent infringement proceedings.  BKI has a right to reimbursement and compensation from gross proceeds we receive from patent enforcement and other patent monetization actions.  We repaid approximately $3.3 million of this contractual obligation in 2016 from proceeds received from a patent license and settlement agreement.  BKI is entitled to priority payment of at least the next $9.7 million in proceeds received by us from any patent-related action.  Thereafter, BKI is entitled to a portion of additional patent-related proceeds up to a contractual minimum return that varies depending upon the timing of the repayment.  In addition, proceeds from patent-related activities may be subject to prorated contingent payments to legal counsel. 
      From 2013 through 2016, our product development efforts were focused on the development and production of modulator/demodulator integrated circuits (“ICs”) based on our proprietary technologies.  These ICs are targeted at less integrated markets than those markets where we believe our technologies are already deployed through the unauthorized use by others.  In 2015 and early 2016, we also offered engineering design services to third-parties for a negotiated fee, to assist customers in their development or testing of components, including wireless devices. We ceased offering design services in early 2016 in favor of deploying our limited resources toward the development of an end-user Wi-Fi product that is expected to be launched in the second quarter of 2017.  
 ﻿
 We anticipate our future business will include the development and sale of ICs and products based on our technologies as well as the licensing of our intellectual property for incorporation into wireless devices designed and manufactured by others.  In addition, during 2016, we began to evaluate acquisition and/or joint venture opportunities with a focus on small to medium sized businesses with product offerings in the Internet of Things (IoT) space that are synergistic with our RF technologies.

Our technology is capable of being incorporated for any of the mobile handset standards, as well as numerous other communications protocols, including Wi-Fi.  By pursuing both licensing and product opportunities, we believe our technologies can be deployed in multiple markets that incorporate RF transmitters, receivers, and/or transceivers, including mobile handsets, tablets, femtocells, digital television, machine-to-machine, RF identification, cable modems, satellite communication, and infrastructure, among others.  In order to secure proper compensation for the unauthorized use of our technologies by others, our licensing efforts also include enforcement actions against parties in some of these markets who we believe have already deployed products that infringe certain of our patented technologies.    ﻿
 Products and Services
 ﻿
 Our current products include a modulator/demodulator component based on our proprietary technologies, the PV5870 IC, as well as a small number of supporting components that are used in the assembly of wireless devices.  The PV5870 IC was targeted for markets that use less integrated RF transceivers than those used by the mobile handset market, such as infrastructure, industrial and military applications.  We sell our PV5870 IC through manufacturers’ representatives who operate on a commission basis and a distribution relationship with RFMW, Ltd.  Our sales of these ICs have been minimal to date. 
     As part of our longer-term product plan, in 2016, our product development efforts included the incorporation of the intellectual property core of the PV5870, along with additional microprocessor capabilities and controls, to create a complete Wi-Fi system-on-chip, the PV6870.  We expect to utilize this IC in our own end-user products that are currently under development as well as future products.  In addition, we intend to market this IC to third-parties for non-competing Wi-Fi offerings    ﻿
 In 2017, we will be introducing a new Wi-Fi home networking product line that is cost-effective and provides highly reliable distributed Wi-Fi coverage throughout a residential space, eliminating dead zones, extending Wi-Fi to new coverage areas, and creating a more even distribution of high data rates.  We have completed development of prototypes of our Wi-Fi product, and in 2017, we began production activities for this product, including purchasing of inventory for use in assembly of the final product, development of test programs, and recruiting of additional staff to support product operations.  We anticipate the launch of a direct marketing campaign for our Wi-Fi product line in the second quarter of 2017.   
 ﻿
 Licensing
 ﻿
 In 2014, we launched a formal licensing campaign to explore licensing opportunities with wireless communications companies that make, use or sell chipsets and/or products that incorporate RF.   We engaged a third-party, 3LP Advisors (“3LP”) to manage our licensing operations under a licensing services agreement that compensated 3LP through a combination of fixed fees and commission-based payments.   We terminated our agreement with 3LP in late 2015, but continue to commit both internal and external resources towards our licensing efforts which include litigation or patent-enforcement efforts.  Currently, we have a perpetual, worldwide license to our current patent portfolio, subject to certain confidential exclusions, with Samsung.

Production and Supply  
 ﻿
 We carry finished product inventory of our modulator/demodulator ICs to support our component sales efforts.  Our work-in-process inventory includes unprocessed wafers that can be diced, packaged and tested with minimal lead time to provide additional finished product inventory.  In addition, we own the tooling to fabricate additional components, subject to a standard foundry lead time, through our fabrication relationships with IBM Microelectronics (“IBM”).  Our next generation ICs are being produced at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”) using a 28 nanometer CMOS semiconductor process.  We believe IBM and TSMC have sufficient capacity to meet our foreseeable needs.  
 ﻿
 For our new Wi-Fi product line, we purchase raw materials and subassemblies from third-party vendors and will complete final assembly, testing and packaging of the product in our facilities.  Our materials generally have multiple sources of supply and relatively short lead-times.  
 ﻿
 Competitive Position  
 ﻿
 We operate in a highly competitive industry against companies with substantially greater financial, technical, and sales and marketing resources.  Our technologies and IC products face competition from incumbent providers of transceivers, such as Broadcom, Fujitsu, Intel, MediaTek, NVidia, Qualcomm, STMicroelectronics, Marvell, Texas Instruments, and others, as well as incumbent providers of power amplifiers, including companies such as Anadigics, Qorvo, and Skyworks, among others.  Each of our competitors, however, also has the potential of becoming a licensing or product customer for our technologies. 
 ﻿
 To date, we are unaware of any competing or emerging RF technologies, other than infringing products that provide all the simultaneous benefits that certain of our technologies enable.  Our unique technologies process RF carriers in a more optimal manner than prior traditional technologies, thereby allowing the creation of handsets and other products that have extended battery life, lower operating temperatures, more easily incorporate multiple air interface standards and frequencies in smaller form factors, improve operational performance, and reduce manufacturing costs.  One or more of these benefits enable some of the key features that can be found in high volume wireless products.  Our technologies provide such attractive benefits, in part, because of their unique operational and/or circuit architectures.  The benefits our technologies enable include highly accurate transmission and reception of RF carriers that use less power than traditional architectures and components, thereby extending battery life, reducing heat and enabling certain size, cost, performance, and packaging advantages.  
 ﻿

We believe the most significant hurdle to the licensing and/or sale of our technologies and products is the widespread use of certain of our technologies in infringing products produced by companies with significantly greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources.  In some cases, the required integration of our technologies with other sub-systems in semiconductor systems on-chip and our lack of tenure in the markets we are targeting provide further hurdles to adoption.  We believe we can gain adoption and/or secure licensing agreements with unauthorized current users of one or more of our technologies, and therefore compete, based on a solid and defensible patent portfolio and the advantages enabled by our unique circuit architectures.  Our circuit architectures are capable of being compliant with all current mobile phone and numerous other wireless industry standards and can be configured to accept all standard baseband data interfaces with the cooperation of the baseband processor providers.  In addition, we believe that one or more of our technology’s abilities to provide improved power efficiencies, highly accurate RF carrier waveforms, reduced cost, smaller form factors and better manufacturing yields, provides a sought-after solution to existing problems in applications for current and next-generation mobile wireless standards, as well as in other applications that use wireless and wired RF where we believe our technologies can provide an attractive solution. 
 ﻿
 Our Wi-Fi end user products are expected to face competition from Netgear, Belkin, Linksys, Google and others who offer home Wi-Fi networking products.  We believe we can gain adoption of our new product offering, and compete, based on price, performance and superior customer experience.  
 ﻿
 Patents and Trademarks 
 ﻿
 We consider our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, and trade secrets to be significant to our competitive positioning.  We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the U.S. and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products.  During 2016, we evaluated our foreign patent portfolio and elected to abandon patents in select jurisdictions where we do not believe the ongoing cost to maintain these patents is justified.  As of December 31, 2016, we had 196 U.S. and 35 foreign patents related to our RF technologies.  In addition, we have approximately 30 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending.  We estimate the economic lives of our patents to be fifteen to twenty years and our current portfolio of issued patents have expirations ranging from 2018 to 2034.
 ﻿
 From time to time, we obtain licenses from others for circuit designs that are peripheral to our core technologies or that provide additional system-on-chip functionality.  We believe there are multiple sources for these types of circuit designs, and we estimate the economic lives of the licenses to be two to five years based on estimated technological obsolescence.   
 ﻿
 Research and Development  
 ﻿
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 we spent approximately $3.3 million, $4.1 million, and $7.0 million, respectively, on Company-sponsored research and development activities.  Our research and development efforts have been, and are expected to continue to be, devoted to the development and advancement of RF technologies, including the development of prototype ICs and products, the development of production-ready silicon samples, reference designs and products for specific applications, the development of software interfaces for our ICs and products, and the creation of test programs for quality control testing of our chipsets and/or products.
