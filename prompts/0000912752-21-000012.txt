ITEM 1.            BUSINESS

We are a diversified television media company with national reach and a strong focus on providing high-quality content on our local television stations, regional and national sports networks, and digital platforms.  The content, distributed through our broadcast platform and third-party platforms, consists of programming provided by third-party networks and syndicators, local news, college and professional sports, and other original programming produced by us.  Additionally, we own digital media products that are complementary to our extensive portfolio of television station and regional sports network related digital properties. Outside of our media related businesses, we operate technical services companies focused on supply and maintenance of broadcast transmission systems as well as research and development for the advancement of broadcast technology, and we manage other non-media related investments.
We are a Maryland corporation founded in 1986.  Our principal executive offices are located at 10706 Beaver Dam Road, Hunt Valley, Maryland 21030.  Our telephone number is (410) 568-1500 and our website address is www.sbgi.net.  The information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated herein by reference.
Segments 
As of December 31, 2020, we have two reportable segments: broadcast and local sports. Our broadcast segment is comprised of all of our television stations, which are owned and/or operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sinclair Television Group, Inc. (STG) and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Our local sports segment is comprised of our regional sports networks, which are owned and operated by our subsidiary, Diamond Sports Group, LLC (DSG) and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. We also earn revenues from our owned networks, original content, digital and internet services, technical services, and non-media investments. These businesses are included within the other segment. Other is not a reportable segment but is included for reconciliation purposes. 
Broadcast 
As of December 31, 2020, our broadcast segment consists primarily of our broadcast television stations. We own, provide programming and operating services pursuant to local marketing agreements (LMAs), or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to other outsourcing agreements (such as joint sales agreements (JSAs) and shared services agreements (SSAs)) to 188 stations in 88 markets. These stations broadcast 628 channels, including 240 channels affiliated with primary networks or program service providers comprised of:  FOX (57), ABC (40), CBS (31), NBC (25), CW (48), and MyNetworkTV (MNT) (39).  The other 388 channels broadcast programming from programming services including Antenna TV, Azteca, Bounce Network, CHARGE!, Comet, Dabl, Decades, Estrella TV, Get TV, Grit, Me TV, Stadium, TBD, Telemundo, This TV, UniMas, Univision, Weather, and two channels broadcasting independent programming. Solely for the purpose of this report, these 188 stations and 628 channels are referred to as “our” stations and channels, and the use of such term shall not be construed as an admission that we control such stations or channels.  Refer to our Television Markets and Stations table later in this Item 1. for more information.
Our broadcast segment provides free over-the-air programming to television viewing audiences in the communities we serve through our local television stations.  The programming that we provide on our primary channels consists of network provided programs, locally-produced news, local sporting events, programming from program service arrangements, syndicated entertainment programs, and internally originated programming. We provide live, local sporting events on many of our stations by acquiring the local television broadcast rights for these events or through our relationship with national networks.  
We are one of the nation's largest producers of local news. We produce more than 2,500 hours of news per week at 130 stations in 82 markets. During 2020, our stations were awarded with 356 journalism awards, including one National Edward R. Murrow award.

Our broadcast segment derives revenue primarily from the sale of advertising inventory on our television stations and fees received from traditional multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs), such as cable and satellite providers; virtual MVPDs (vMVPDs, and together with MVPDs, "Distributors"), which distribute multiple television channels through the internet without supplying their own data transport infrastructure; and other over-the-top (OTT) distributors that deliver live and on-demand programming over the internet, for the right to distribute our channels on their distribution platforms without a subscription with a Distributor. We also earn revenues by selling digital advertisements on third-party platforms and providing digital content to non-linear devices via websites, mobile, and social media advertisements. Our objective is to meet the needs of our advertising customers by delivering significant audiences in key demographics. Our strategy is to achieve this objective by providing quality local news programming, popular network, syndicated and live sports programs, and other original content to our viewing audience. We attract most of our national television advertisers through national marketing representation firms which have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas. Our local television advertisers are primarily attracted through the use of a local sales force at each of our television stations, which is comprised of approximately 600 marketing consultants and 90 local sales managers company-wide.
Our operating results are subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising. Political spending has been significantly higher in the even-number years due to the cyclicality of political elections. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising related to the presidential election. Because of the political election cyclicality, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing even-numbered years’ performance to the odd numbered years’ performance. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number and importance of individual political races and issues discussed on a national level as well as those within the local communities we serve. We believe political advertising will continue to be an important advertising category in our industry. Political advertising levels may increase further as political-activism, around social, political, economic and environmental causes, continues to draw attention and Political Action Committees (PACs), including so-called Super PACs, continue to increase spending.

Local sports
On August 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of the controlling interests in certain regional sports network brands and Fox College Sports (collectively, the Acquired RSNs) from The Walt Disney Company (Disney). See Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In February 2019, we announced a joint venture with the Chicago Cubs (Cubs) that owns and operates Marquee Sports Network (Marquee, and, collectively with the Acquired RSNs, the RSNs), a regional sports network based in Chicago, Illinois. Marquee debuted February 22, 2020 with the airing of the Cubs’ first Spring Training game and is the Chicago-region’s exclusive network for fans to view live Cubs games, exclusive Cubs content, and other local sports programming. On August 29, 2019 we acquired a minority equity interest in the Yankee Entertainment and Sports Network (the YES Network), a regional sports network based in New York, New York. 
Through our RSNs and the YES Network, we own equity interests in the largest collection of regional sports networks in the United States, broadcasting approximately 4,800 professional sports games and producing approximately 24,800 hours of new content each year. As a result of the modified sports seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, our RSNs and the YES Network broadcast approximately 2,270 professional sports games and produced approximately 12,200 hours of new content. Our RSNs and the YES Network are located in attractive, highly-populated geographic areas of the United States with significant local viewership and 45 of the most exciting professional sports teams. Our RSNs are a premier destination for local sports viewership, with premium live sports content reaching approximately 52 million subscribers nationally, excluding YES Network subscribers. Our RSNs and the YES Network have an extensive footprint that includes exclusive long-term agreements with 16 Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, 17 National Basketball Association (NBA) teams and 12 National Hockey League (NHL) teams. Within our sports network portfolio are 21 regional sports network brands (to be rebranded as 19 Bally Sports network brands), Marquee, and a minority equity interest in the YES Network. We generate revenues by distributing our networks to Distributors, and from the sale of advertising inventory.
In connection with our agreement with Bally's Corporation (Bally's), our RSNs will be rebranded with the Bally Sports name. See Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6. Other Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. As of December 31, 2020, our RSNs have relationships with the following professional teams.

MLB Teams | NBA Teams | NHL Teams 
Arizona Diamondbacks | Atlanta Hawks | Anaheim Ducks 
Atlanta Braves | Charlotte Hornets | Arizona Coyotes 
Chicago Cubs | Cleveland Cavaliers | Carolina Hurricanes

Other
Owned Networks and Content
We own and operate Tennis Channel, a cable network which includes coverage of many of tennis' top tournaments and original professional sport and tennis lifestyle shows; Tennis Magazine, the sport’s largest print publication; and Tennis.com (collectively, Tennis), the most visited online tennis platform in the world.
We also own and operate various networks carried on distribution platforms owned by us or others, including: Comet, our science fiction network; CHARGE!, our adventure and action-based network; TBD, the first multiscreen TV network in the U.S. market to bring premium internet-first content to TV homes across America; and Stadium, a network that brings together professional sports highlights and college games. 
Our internally developed content, in addition to our local news, includes Ring of Honor (ROH), our professional wrestling promotion; The National Desk hosted by Jan Jeffcoat (The National Desk); and Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson (Full Measure), our national Sunday morning investigative and political analysis program. 
Digital and Internet
In January 2019, we launched STIRR, a national free, ad-supported direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming app, which offers live and on-demand content spanning entertainment, sports, and news. With more than 6 million app downloads to date, STIRR had a break-out year and exceeded expectations with viewership up significantly, doubling the number of average monthly users and minutes viewed for the full year compared to a year ago. Driving this growth is STIRR’s local news channel, STIRR City, the addition of exclusive local on-demand rights, over 120 free TV channels, and two commercial free channels that cover both local and national elections and Covid-19 live press conferences from across the country. STIRR’s growth throughout the year enabled it to reach critical mass for national and local advertisers. 
We earn revenues from Compulse Integrated Marketing (Compulse), a full-service digital agency which uses our digital expertise, including our OTT advertising platform, CompulseOTT, to help businesses run social media, search, advertising, email marketing, web design, mobile marketing and creative services, audience extension, and navigate and compete in a world of constant innovation and changes in consumer behavior. 
DataSphere Technologies, provides marketing services to small businesses across the country and works in partnership with multiple media companies, including Sinclair. NewsON is a free, ad-supported app that provides instant access to live or on-demand local news broadcasts, including non-Sinclair affiliate partners. Sinclair Digital Ventures focuses on investment in emerging digital technologies, ad tech, and digital content companies that support, complement, or expand the Company's businesses. 
 In November 2020, we entered into agreements for a long-term, enterprise-wide strategic partnership with Bally's Corporation (Bally's) to combine Bally's vertically integrated, proprietary sports betting technology and expansive market access footprint with our premier portfolio of local broadcast stations, RSNs, Tennis Channel, STIRR and digital and over-the-air television network Stadium. This partnership is expected to enhance the gamification of live sports to provide audiences a first-of-its-kind interactive viewing experience and drive legalized sports betting monetization. In connection with the agreement, we also received various equity interests in Bally's. See Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6. Other Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Technical Services
We own subsidiaries which are dedicated to providing technical services to the broadcast industry, including: Acrodyne Technical Services, a provider of service and support for broadcast transmitters throughout the world; Dielectric, a designer and manufacturer of broadcast systems including all components from transmitter output to antenna; and ONE Media 3.0, whose purpose is to develop business opportunities, products, and services associated with the NEXTGEN TV broadcast transmission standard and TV platform. We have also partnered with several other companies in the design and deployment of NEXTGEN TV services including: Saankhya Labs to develop NEXTGEN TV technologies to be used in consumer devices; Cast.era, a joint venture with South Korea’s leading mobile operator, SK Telecom, to develop wireless, cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence technologies; and BitPath, a joint venture with Nexstar Media Group, to deploy and exploit datacasting models using NEXTGEN capabilities.
Non-media Investments
We own various non-media related investments across multiple asset classes including private equity, mezzanine financing, and real estate investments. Some of the largest investments include: Triangle Sign and Service (Triangle), a sign designer and fabricator; Jefferson Park, a mixed-use land development project in Frederick, MD; investments in sustainability initiatives; and a portfolio of apartment complexes.
Customers
In 2020, the broadcast and local sports segments had three customers, AT&T, Charter Communications, and Comcast, that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Any disruption in our relationship with these customers could have a material adverse effect on the broadcast segment, the local sports segment, and our results of operations.
Operating Strategy
Programming to Attract Viewership.  We seek to target our programming offerings to attract viewership, to meet the needs of the communities in which we serve, and to meet the needs of our advertising customers.  
Our stations seek to broadcast live local and national sporting events that would appeal to a large segment of the local community.  Moreover, our stations produce local news at 130 stations in 82 markets. See News below for further discussion. Our stations also seek to develop original programming or obtain, at attractive prices, popular syndicated programming that is complementary to each station’s network programming. 
Television advertising prices are based on ratings information measured and distributed by Nielsen and Comscore. Ratings methodologies have been changing rapidly due to advancements in technology and changes in the manners in which viewers consume news, sports, and entertainment. Certain new methodologies are currently not accredited by the Media Rating Council (MRC), an independent organization that monitors rating services, and may not reflect actual viewership levels.
Our RSNs intend to continue to invest in producing popular sports programming, and measure audience engagement and needs to determine what our sports fans value most and to continue to work to deliver premier sports content in the markets in which we operate.
Our RSNs intend to continue investing in technologies that improve the viewer experience of our loyal sports fans and that will help tell the "story" of a sports game and make our offering more appealing to the viewer. These technologies could allow the viewer to control the camera angle, add customized audio tracks to the broadcast, integrate social media, overlay statistics, gaming or otherwise customize his or her experience. Additionally, our broad rights position us to benefit from new viewing technologies as they are developed, such as virtual, augmented and mixed reality. As these technological capabilities develop, we will invest in bringing them to our premium live sports content.
News.  Through local news, our mission is to serve our communities by sharing relevant information to alert, protect, and empower our audiences. We believe that the production and broadcasting of local news is an important link to the community and an aid to a station’s efforts to expand its viewership. In addition, local news programming can provide access to advertising sources targeted specifically to local news viewers. Our news stations also produce content on digital platforms such as websites, mobile applications, OTT distributors, and social media. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 34% of our stations' net time sales were earned during the local news we produce each week.
Our local news initiatives are an important part of our strategy. We have entered into local news sharing arrangements in which we receive news in nine markets from other in-market broadcasters. We believe that, in the markets where we have news share arrangements, such arrangements generally provide both higher viewer ratings and revenues for the station receiving the news and generate a profit for the news share provider. Generally, both parties and the local community are beneficiaries of these arrangements.
In addition to our traditional local news stories, we have utilized our national reach and physical presence in the nation's capital to provide our local viewers with broader national news stories which are relevant to our local viewers.
Our local news coverage is supported by our national news desk and Capitol Hill bureau. These teams focus on providing context and perspective to important stories in the daily news cycle. This content provides a significant point of difference with a focus on accountability reporting. Available on-air and online, the bureau not only expands our news presence, but gives our local station viewers an opportunity to hear the views of their members of Congress through programs such as "Connect to Congress," our weekly on-air and digital feature which provides an electronic video pathway for lawmakers to speak to their constituents. Our weekly investigative news program, Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson, reinforces our mission to provide our fearless storytelling on significant topics of public importance. 
In January 2021, we launched our original news program, The National Desk, on 68 of our stations, including MNT and CW, on STIRR, and across all of our news websites. The National Desk is hosted by award-winning anchor Jan Jeffcoat, who provides audiences with commentary-free news coverage from both a local and national perspective. Leveraging Sinclair’s expansive local news footprint, The National Desk elevates some of the most important stories occurring in cities and towns across the country. With reporters residing in the communities they cover, The National Desk has access to real stories from the perspectives of those they affect directly. The goal of The National Desk is to leverage these assets into a single news program for a national audience. The program also supplements expansive local coverage by bringing the most important national headlines to audiences.
We have a national investigative team of 15 journalists, plus more than 30 local investigative reporters. We plan to continue to grow our investigative footprint, and to provide in-depth stories not covered elsewhere.
We provide our viewers with "Town Halls," which bring together our viewers to discuss major local and national topics. In 2018 we began producing the "Your Voice Your Future Opioid Town Hall" and in 2019 we produced 25 Town Halls on the opioids crisis. The year 2020 was a unique year, yet productive. Overall, we produced 143 Town Halls. Our stations produced 53 debates, 16 hour long discussions on race relations, and 18 "COVID Town Halls", helping our viewers cope and decipher information to help their families through very difficult times. Since launching our commitment to give a voice to our viewers, our Town Halls have produced over 835 hours to address the needs of and educate our audience.
With more than 6 million app downloads to date, STIRR had a break-out year and exceeded expectations with viewership up significantly, doubling the number of average monthly users and minutes viewed for the full year compared to a year ago. Driving this growth is STIRR’s local news channel, STIRR City, the addition of exclusive local on-demand rights, over 120 free TV channels, and two commercial free channels that cover both local and national elections and Covid-19 live press conferences from across the country. We also own NewsOn, a single app to watch live, local news on mobile and OTT devices.
Sports. Live sports have remained highly popular with fans and advertisers. Sports programming generally elicits strong emotional responses and attracts a loyal and passionate following among fans. Our premium live sports programming typically attracts viewership demographics that are highly desirable to advertisers. Sports viewership among the key 25 to 54 year-old demographic continues to outperform all other content. Every sports season is a new chapter in a story that has continued for decades and is popular across fans from multiple generations. As media has continued to trend toward on-demand consumption, sports events have remained an ‘‘appointment viewing’’ event. As such, live sports content is frequently the most watched programming in a local market on most nights.
Through our RSNs and the YES Network, we own equity interests in the largest collection of regional sports networks in the United States, located in attractive, highly-populated geographic areas with significant local viewership and 45 of the most exciting professional sports teams. Our RSNs are a premier destination for local sports viewership, with premium live sports content reaching approximately 52 million subscribers nationally, excluding YES Network subscribers. Our RSNs and the YES Network have an extensive footprint that includes exclusive long-term agreements with 16 Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, 17 National Basketball Association (NBA) teams and 12 National Hockey League (NHL) teams. 
Tennis has certain telecast rights to the US Open, Wimbledon, Roland Garros (French Open), Australian Open, ATP World Tour events, WTA competitions, Fed Cup, Laver Cup and the ATP Cup; and College and Junior events and exhibitions. Our stations also broadcast programming and other content provided by Tennis and we provide access to certain events through our premium OTT offering, Tennis Channel Plus. Tennis also includes Tennis.com, the most visited online tennis platform in the world. Tennis' complementary offerings allow us to provide greater and more in depth tennis content to consumers on TV, internet, and print. 
Additionally, some of our stations have the local television broadcast rights for certain sporting events, including MLB, NBA, NHL, National Football League (NFL) preseason, and certain other college and high school sports. Our CW and MNT stations generally face fewer preemption restrictions on broadcasting live local sporting events compared with our FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC stations, which are required to broadcast a greater number of hours of programming supplied by the networks. In addition, our stations that are affiliated with FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC have network arrangements to broadcast certain MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, and Professional Golf Association (PGA) events, as well as other popular sporting events.
Control of Operating and Programming Costs.  By employing a disciplined approach to managing programming acquisition and other costs, our stations have been able to achieve operating margins that we believe are very competitive within the television broadcast industry. We believe our national reach as of December 31, 2020 of approximately 39% of the country provides us with a strong position to negotiate with programming providers and, as a result, the opportunity to purchase high quality programming at more favorable prices. Moreover, we emphasize control of each of our station’s programming and operating costs through program-specific profit analysis, detailed budgeting, regionalization of staff, and detailed long-term planning models. We also control our programming cost by creating original high-quality programming that is distributed on our broadcast platform.
Our RSNs manage our programming rights costs to improve margins and increase our cash flow. We intend to balance our portfolio to ensure that losing one team’s rights will not materially harm the overall product offering. We intend to maintain our disciplined approach to non-programming expense management by seeking opportunities to increase our efficiency without jeopardizing our commitment to provide high quality sports content to our customers. We will seek to emphasize high quality production at low cost with a continuous focus on technological advancements and managing the cost of on-air talent retention, overhead, and salaries and compensation. 
Developing Local Franchises.  We believe the greatest opportunity for a sustainable and growing customer base lies within our local communities. Therefore, we have focused on developing a strong local sales force, which is comprised of approximately 600 marketing consultants and 90 local sales managers company-wide. Excluding political advertising revenue, distribution revenues, and other local revenues, 45% and 62% of net time sales were local for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our goal is to grow our local revenues by increasing our market share, developing new business opportunities, and offering marketing solutions across our platforms. 
Attract and Retain High Quality Management.  We believe that much of our success is due to our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled and motivated managers at corporate, stations, RSNs, and other businesses. We provide a combination of base salary, long-term incentive compensation including equity awards and, where appropriate, cash bonus pay designed to be competitive with comparable employers in our industry. A significant portion of the compensation available to certain members of our senior management and our sales force is based on their achievement of certain performance goals. We also encourage station and network managers and employees to utilize our diverse business to grow in their careers while remaining in the Sinclair family via internal promotion and relocation.
Multi-Channel Broadcasting.  FCC rules allow television broadcasters to transmit additional digital channels within the spectrum allocated to each FCC license holder. This provides our stations' viewers with additional programming alternatives at no additional cost to them. We may consider other alternative programming formats that we could air using our multi-channel digital spectrum space with the goal towards achieving higher profits and community service. As of December 31, 2020, our stations have 441 multi-channels in our digital spectrum.
Distribution Agreements.  We have distribution agreements with Distributors and other OTT distributors who compensate us for the right to retransmit our stations, RSNs, and other offerings on their respective distribution platforms. Our successful negotiations with Distributors and other OTT distributors have created agreements that produce meaningful sustainable revenue streams. We intend to maintain the strong relationships with our Distributors and other OTT distributors and believe our local news, sports and entertainment content positions us to continue to expand our agreements within all of these distribution platforms. However, we cannot guarantee that some Distributors and other OTT distributors will not drop carriage of our channels. Many of our existing sports programming rights agreements include springing rights that automatically provide our RSNs with the rights to additional forms of distribution if the leagues permit their teams to exploit those distribution rights, enabling us to continue to adapt to changing consumption habits.
Improvement and Maintenance of Our Distribution Platforms.  Our Acrodyne and Dielectric subsidiaries are leaders in servicing and manufacturing broadcast infrastructure. As a result, we maintain a strong infrastructure through which we provide high quality uninterrupted content on our stations. These subsidiaries are critical in the buildout of the infrastructure behind the NEXTGEN TV for both our stations and other broadcasters.
Developing New Business.  We strive to develop new business models to complement or enhance our traditional television broadcast business. We have developed new ways to sell online, mobile text messaging, social media advertising, and audience extension services along with our traditional commercial broadcasting model. Additionally, we continue to leverage our national reach to provide new high-quality content to our local communities.
We continue to expand our digital distribution platforms through initiatives such as our video management system, which simplifies and automates our broadcast-to-digital streaming workflow and allows for dynamic replacement of broadcast ads with digital ads targeted to each individual viewer and allows us to ingest and redistribute content across our platform so that we can break news first. By using a single ad-serving system across all of our web sites, mobile apps, and other digital assets, we are able to streamline our sales workflow, optimize yield, and deliver comprehensive sales opportunities across our digital footprint. Additionally, we are deploying DTC and OTT initiatives, such as STIRR, as well as our own content applications. 
Additionally, we have continued to develop business opportunities, products, and services associated with NEXTGEN TV as discussed under Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform below.
Our RSNs seek to maximize growth in our advertising revenue. We believe that through higher quality non-game programming and multiplatform offerings, we will be able to drive incremental improvements in our RSN advertising revenues. We believe political advertising, which historically has been a relatively small portion of our RSN advertising revenue, could be an avenue to grow advertising dollars given our RSNs’ large viewing audiences. Our live sports content is appealing to both national and local advertisers and is diverse across industries. In addition, we believe that the legalization of sports betting provides incremental opportunities for the business to generate higher advertising revenue due to increased advertising spend from certain customers, increased viewer engagement ratings, creation of the RSNs' digital app and optimization of digital impressions.
Many of our existing sports programming rights agreements include springing rights that automatically provide our RSNs with the rights to additional forms of distribution as soon as the leagues permit their teams to exploit those distribution rights. As more of our RSNs are permitted to expand into digital streaming, we expect to monetize our viewership by selling targeted advertising on our digital feeds and by introducing our digital agency services to our RSN advertisers. We believe that our RSN portfolio is well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing transition of the media world to digital and mobile viewing.
We believe that the legalization of sports betting provides incremental opportunities for the business to generate higher advertising revenue due to increased advertising spend from certain customers and from increased viewer engagement and ratings. In November 2020, we entered into agreements for a long-term strategic partnership with Bally's to combine Bally's vertically integrated, proprietary sports betting technology and expansive market access footprint with our premier portfolio of local broadcast stations and RSNs, STIRR, Tennis Channel and digital and over-the-air television network Stadium. This will create further gamification of live sports that will provide audiences a first-of-its-kind personalized and interactive viewing experience.
Strategic Realignment of Media Portfolio.  We routinely review potential media acquisitions, dispositions, swaps, or develop original networks and content. We expect to continue to assess acquisition and investment opportunities to complement our existing stations, RSNs, and other businesses. As we evaluate potential acquisitions and investments, we intend to focus on making disciplined, accretive acquisitions and investments that will complement our existing portfolio of television stations and RSNs while providing increased scale. At any given time, we may be in discussions with one or more media owners.
Digital and Internet.  Our digital properties, Compulse, STIRR, Datasphere, and NewsOn are innovative products and extensions of our core broadcast business that allow us to compete for digital, internet, network, and print impressions and revenues. We continue to seek additional opportunities to invest in emerging digital technologies, ad tech, and digital content companies that support and expand our digital capabilities and non-linear footprint.
Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform. In 2017, the FCC approved the use of NEXTGEN TV, a next generation broadcast transmission standard. NEXTGEN TV is capable of merging broadcast and broadband content and data services using over-the-air spectrum and Internet-provided data connectivity, allowing a mature broadcast industry to reinvent itself due to its mobility, addressability, capacity, IP connectivity, and conditional access.
NEXTGEN TV will allow us to use our spectrum for more than just video-formatted data as we do today. As a data-agnostic Internet Protocol (IP) based pipe, we also will be able to distribute data including text, audio, video, and software. While our one-to-many architecture will remain a strength, we will be able to deliver “the last mile” from program/data origination to the consumer's receiver device across a more robust system, connect legacy ATSC 1.0 televisions to NEXTGEN TV using broadcast hot spots and wi-fi functionality, and provide compatible data-offload service offerings in conjunction with certain 5G platforms. Among the many emerging opportunities are hyper-local news, weather, and traffic; dynamic ad insertion; geographic and demographic-targeted advertising; customizable content; better measurement and analytics; the ability to interface with devices connected to the Internet; flexibility to add streams as needed; substantially enhanced picture quality with immersive audio; connectivity to automobiles, including 3D mapping, telematics and infotainment; geo-location services; data wholesale models; and other content delivery networks. Conditional access capabilities also permit broadcasters to offer secure “skinny-bundle” pay services as well as various video-on-demand type offerings. In addition, NEXTGEN TV provides new emergency and information capabilities, including advanced alerting functions which can provide crucial rich media including evacuation routes and device wake-up features. All of these features will be available to mobile and portable devices, allowing us to reach viewers virtually anywhere. In January 2020, we announced the formation of Cast.era, a joint venture with SK Telecom, focused on cloud infrastructure for broadcasting, ultra-low latency OTT broadcasting, and targeted advertising.
In order to bring this technology to the market, we have partnered with technology leaders to develop broadcasting solutions and services in the U.S. and globally. We have also formed a joint venture with other broadcasters, BitPath, to promote spectrum efficiency and innovation, aggregate and monetize underutilized spectrum capacity over which to deliver national services, and create opportunities such as robust video and data exchange. We continue to work with other NEXTGEN TV stakeholders to build and test the single frequency network tower infrastructure, develop systems to allow the convergence of NEXTGEN TV and 5G data delivery, and design NEXTGEN TV receiver chips for mobile, portable and fixed devices. We expect the implementation and adoption of NEXTGEN TV to occur over the next three years. In 2020, we and the industry began deployment of NEXTGEN TV capabilities on some of our own television facilities and in conjunction with other station operators in our markets, as well as non-Sinclair markets. As of the end of January 2021, NEXTGEN TV had been launched in 12 of our markets. When completed, the country will have a lower-cost, world class wireless IP data distribution network capable of supporting multiple business models.
Monetization of Certain Intellectual Property Rights. We have developed, on our own and through our ONE Media, LLC joint venture, several NEXTGEN TV-related patents that we intend to monetize directly, through third-party agents, or through a patent pool designed to consolidate similar patents owned by independent licensors for licensing to equipment manufacturers.
FEDERAL REGULATION OF TELEVISION BROADCASTING
The ownership, operation, and sale of television stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under the authority granted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act).  Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines the particular frequencies, locations, and operating power of stations; issues, renews, revokes, and modifies station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation, and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules and regulations of the Communications Act.
The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and specific FCC regulations and policies.  Reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC rules, and the public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
License Grant and Renewal
Television stations operate pursuant to broadcasting licenses that are granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC.  During certain periods when renewal applications are pending, petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public.
Although historically renewal of a license is granted in the vast majority of cases, even when petitions to deny are filed, there can be no assurance that the license of any station will be renewed or, if renewed, that the renewal terms will be for the maximum term permitted.
All of our stations' most recent license renewal applications have been granted for the maximum term permitted. The current television license renewal application cycle began on June 1, 2020. On November 26, 2018, the American Cable Association (ACA) filed an informal request with the FCC seeking to require the early filing of renewal applications for the licenses of four of our stations, and an individual filed a similar informal request on July 22, 2019 with respect to our Baltimore, MD station, WBFF(TV), and two Baltimore stations with which we have a JSA or LMA (WUTB(TV) and WNUV(TV)). The FCC dismissed both informal requests on April 29, 2020. The individual requestor filed an application for review of the FCC’s dismissal on May 22, 2020, which the FCC declined to act on prior to the ordinary June 1, 2020 renewal application filing deadline for the stations. On September 1, 2020, the same individual filed a petition to deny the license renewal applications of WBFF(TV), WUTB(TV), and WNUV(TV). We filed an opposition to the petition on October 1, 2020 with respect to WBFF(TV), and the petition remains pending at this time. We cannot predict when the FCC will take action on the petition or what the outcome of such action will be. To date, we have timely filed all renewal applications due for our stations during this renewal application cycle.
Ownership Matters
General.  The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC.  In determining whether to permit the assignment or transfer of control of, or the grant or renewal of, a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the licensee and those persons holding “attributable” interests in that licensee and compliance with the Communications Act’s limitations on foreign ownership. The FCC has indicated that in order to approve an assignment or transfer of a broadcast license the FCC must make an affirmative determination that the proposed transaction serves the public interest, not merely that the transaction does not violate its rules or shares factual elements with other transactions previously approved by the FCC, and that it may deny a transaction if it determines that the transaction would not be in the public interest.
The FCC generally applies its ownership limits to “attributable” interests held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other association. In the case of corporations holding, or through subsidiaries controlling, broadcast licenses, the interests of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the corporation’s stock (or 20% or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies, investment companies and bank trust departments that are passive investors) are generally attributable. In addition, pursuant to what is known as the equity-debt-plus rule, a major programming supplier or same-market media entity will be an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or same-market media entity holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station’s total debt plus equity. Further, the Communications Act generally prohibits foreign parties from having more than a 20% interest (voting or equity) in a broadcast licensee or more than a 25% interest in the parent of that licensee without receiving prior FCC approval to exceed these limits. Following a Declaratory Ruling in 2013 in which the FCC indicated that it was open to considering proposals for foreign investment in broadcast licenses that exceed the 25% benchmark on a case by case basis, on September 29, 2016, the FCC adopted a Report and Order which among other things, (i) simplified the foreign ownership approval process for broadcast licensees seeking to exceed the 25% benchmark and (ii) modified the methodology a licensee may use to determine compliance with the foreign ownership rules.
We and our subsidiaries are domestic entities, and the members of the Smith family (who, as of December 31, 2020, together hold approximately 81.1% of the common voting rights of Sinclair) are all United States citizens. Our articles of incorporation contain limitations on alien ownership and control that are substantially similar to those contained in the Communications Act. Pursuant to the articles of incorporation, we have the right to repurchase alien-owned shares at their fair market value to the extent necessary, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, to comply with the alien ownership restrictions.
Additional ownership rules as currently in effect are as follows:
Radio / Television Cross-Ownership Rule and Newspaper / Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule.  Until February 2018, the FCC’s rules (i) limited the combined number of television and radio stations a party could own in a market to up to two television stations and six radio stations, depending on the number of independent media voices in the market (radio/television cross ownership rule), and (ii) prohibited the common ownership of a radio or television broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same market (newspaper/broadcast cross ownership rule). On November 20, 2017, the FCC released an Order on Reconsideration (Ownership Order on Reconsideration) that, among other changes, eliminated the radio/television cross-ownership rule and the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule. The rule changes adopted in the Ownership Order on Reconsideration became effective on February 7, 2018. Petitions for Review of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration were filed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and we filed to intervene in the proceeding. On September 23, 2019, the court vacated and remanded the Ownership Order on Reconsideration. Petitions for rehearing en banc were filed with the Third Circuit by the FCC and industry intervenors (including the Company) on November 7, 2019. The Third Circuit denied the petitions for rehearing on November 20, 2019 and the court’s mandate issued on November 29, 2019. On April 17, 2020, the FCC and industry intervenors (including us) filed petitions for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, which petitions were granted on October 2, 2020. The briefing schedule concluded on January 12, 2021, and oral argument was heard on January 19, 2021. We cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding. While the proceeding remains pending before the Supreme Court, the FCC’s rules that were in effect prior to February 2018, remain in effect.
National Ownership Rule. The national television viewing audience reach cap is 39%. Under this rule, where an individual or entity has an attributable interest in more than one television station in a market, the percentage of the national television viewing audience encompassed within that market is only counted once. Additionally, because VHF stations (channels 2 through 13) historically covered a larger portion of the market than UHF stations (channels 14 through 51), only half of the households in the market area of any UHF station are included when calculating an entity’s national television viewing audience (commonly referred to as the UHF discount). On September 6, 2016, the FCC released a Report and Order eliminating the UHF discount (the UHF Discount Order), and on April 21, 2017, the FCC released an Order on Reconsideration (the UHF Discount Order on Reconsideration) to reinstate the UHF discount pending a future rulemaking to examine the UHF discount together with the national audience reach cap. The UHF discount was reinstated on June 15, 2017 and is currently in effect. A Petition for Review of the UHF Discount Order on Reconsideration was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on May 12, 2017, and was dismissed by the Court on July 25, 2018. On December 18, 2017, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to examine the national audience reach cap, including the UHF discount. The rulemaking proceeding remains pending. We cannot predict the outcome of the rulemaking proceeding.
The majority of the stations we own and operate, or to which we provide programming services, are UHF. With the UHF discount, our current reach (for FCC purposes) is approximately 25% of U.S. households. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risk related to the outcome of rules governing the UHF discount.
Local Television Ownership Rule.  A party may own television stations in adjoining markets, even if there is a digital noise limited service contour overlap between the two stations’ broadcast signals, and generally may own two stations in the same market (local television ownership rule) only (i) if there is no digital overlap between the stations; or (ii) not more than one station is among the top-four rated stations in the market (the top-four rule) and the market containing both of the stations would contain at least eight independently owned full-power television stations post-acquisition (the eight voices test). The Ownership Order on Reconsideration eliminated the eight voices test and also modified the top-four rule to permit parties to own up to two top-four rated stations in the same market on a case-by-case basis. On September 23, 2019, the Third Circuit vacated and remanded the Ownership Order on Reconsideration. On September 23, 2019, the Third Circuit vacated and remanded the Ownership Order on Reconsideration. The Third Circuit’s decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari and heard oral argument on January 19, 2021. We cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding. While the proceeding remains pending before the Supreme Court, the FCC’s rules that were in effect prior to February 2018, including the top-four rule and the eight voices test, remain in effect.
Local Marketing and Outsourcing Agreements
Certain of our stations have entered into agreements with other stations in the same market, through which we provide programming and operating services pursuant to LMAs or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to outsourcing agreements, such as JSAs and SSAs. LMAs are attributable where a licensee holds an attributable interest in a television station and (i) programs more than 15% of the weekly broadcast hours and/or (ii) sells more than 15% of the weekly advertising time on another television station in the same market. LMAs existing prior to November 5, 1996, which include all of our LMAs, are currently grandfathered until further FCC action. If the FCC were to eliminate the grandfathering of these LMAs, we would have to terminate or modify these LMAs.
In August 2016, the FCC completed both its 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial Regulatory Reviews of its media ownership rules and issued an order (Ownership Order) which left most of the existing multiple ownership rules intact, but amended the rules to provide for the attribution of JSAs where two television stations are located in the same market, and a party with an attributable interest in one station sells more than 15% of the advertising time per week of the other station. JSAs existing as of March 31, 2014 were grandfathered until October 1, 2025, at which point they would have to be terminated, amended or otherwise come into compliance with the JSA attribution rule. The subsequent Ownership Order on Reconsideration eliminated the JSA attribution rule. The Third Circuit vacated and remanded the Ownership Order on Reconsideration on appeal in September 2019, resulting in the reinstatement of the majority of the Ownership Order, including the JSA attribution rule. The Third Circuit’s decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari and heard oral argument on January 19, 2021. While the proceeding remains pending before the Supreme Court, the FCC’s rules that were in effect prior to February 2018, including the JSA attribution rule, remain in effect. We cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding. If we are required to terminate or modify our LMAs or JSAs, our business could be adversely affected in several ways, including losses on investments and termination penalties. For more information on the risks, see Changes in rules on local marketing agreements under "The FCC's multiple ownership rules and federal antitrust regulation may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets." within Item 1A. Risk Factors and Changes in the Rules of Television Ownership, Local Marketing Agreements, Joint Sales Agreements, Retransmission Consent Negotiations, and National Ownership Cap under Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Antitrust Regulation.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission have increased their scrutiny of the television industry and have reviewed matters related to the concentration of ownership within markets (including LMAs and outsourcing agreements) even when ownership or the LMA or other outsourcing agreement in question is permitted under the laws administered by the FCC or by FCC rules and regulations.  The DOJ takes the position that an LMA or other outsourcing agreement entered into in anticipation of a station’s acquisition with the proposed buyer of the station constitutes a change in beneficial ownership of the station which, if subject to filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, cannot be implemented until the waiting period required by that statute has ended or been terminated.
On January 4, 2019, the Company received three civil investigative demands (CIDs) from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. We believe the DOJ has similar civil investigative demands to other companies in our industry. In each CID, the DOJ requested that the Company produce certain documents and materials relating to JSAs in a specific DMA. We are cooperating and are in discussions with the DOJ regarding our responses to the CIDs. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the CID process, including whether it will result in any action or proceeding against us.
Satellite Carriage
The Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA), as extended by The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 (SHVIA), the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA), the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (STELA) and the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization (STELAR) among other things, (i) allows satellite carriers to provide local television signals by satellite within a station market, and requires them to carry all local signals that asserted carriage rights in any market where they carry any local signals, (ii) requires all television stations to elect to exercise certain “must-carry” or “retransmission consent” rights in connection with their carriage by satellite carriers, and (iii) authorizes satellite delivery of distant network signals, significantly viewed signals and local low-power television station signals into local markets under defined circumstances. In adopting fiscal year 2020 appropriations legislation, Congress allowed STELAR to sunset on December 31, 2019 but made permanent STELAR’s (1) requirements that broadcasters and Distributors negotiate retransmission content in good faith and (2) distant signal satellite license provisions for recreational vehicles, truckers, tailgaters and short markets. To qualify for the permanent license, satellite operators were required to begin delivering local-into-local service in all currently “unserved” markets by the appropriations bill’s May 31, 2020 deadline.
Must-Carry / Retransmission Consent
Television broadcasters are required to make triennial elections to exercise either certain “must-carry” or “retransmission consent” rights in connection with their carriage by cable systems in each broadcaster’s local market.   By electing to exercise must-carry rights, a broadcaster demands carriage and receives a specific channel on cable systems within its DMA. Must carry rights are not absolute and are dependent on a number of factors which may or may not be present in a particular case.  Alternatively, if a broadcaster chooses to exercise retransmission consent rights, it can prohibit cable systems from carrying its signal or grant the appropriate cable system the authority to retransmit the broadcast signal for a fee or other consideration.  We have elected to exercise our retransmission consent rights with respect to all of our stations. In February 2015, the FCC issued an order implementing certain statutorily required changes to its rules governing the duty to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. Under these rules, unless the stations are directly or indirectly under common de jure control as permitted under the FCC regulations, a station may not delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to a station located in the same market or to a third party that negotiates together with another television station in the same market, nor may stations in the same market facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms for their stations in that market, including through the sharing of information.
Further, in September 2015, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in response to a Congressional directive in STELAR to examine the “totality of the circumstances test” for good-faith negotiations of retransmission consent. The proposed rulemaking sought comment on new factors and evidence to consider in its evaluation of claims of bad faith negotiation, including service interruptions prior to a “marquee sports or entertainment event,” restrictions on online access to broadcast programming during negotiation impasses, broadcasters’ ability to offer bundles of broadcast signals with other broadcast stations or cable networks, and broadcasters’ ability to invoke the FCC’s exclusivity rules during service interruptions. On July 14, 2016, the FCC's then-Chairman Wheeler announced that the FCC would not, at that time, proceed to adopt additional rules governing good faith negotiations of retransmission consent. No formal action has yet been taken on this Proposed Rulemaking, and we cannot predict if the FCC will agree to terminate the Rulemaking without action.
Network Non-Duplication / Syndicated Exclusivity / Territorial Exclusivity
The FCC’s syndicated exclusivity rules allow local broadcast television stations to demand that cable operators black out syndicated non-network programming carried on “distant signals” (i.e., signals of broadcast stations, including so-called “superstations,” which serve areas substantially removed from the cable systems’ local community).  The FCC’s network non-duplication rules allow local broadcast, network affiliated stations to require that cable operators black out duplicate network programming carried on distant signals.  Both rules are subject to various exceptions and limitations.  In a number of markets in which we own or program stations affiliated with a network, a station that is affiliated with the same network in a nearby market is carried on cable systems in our markets.  Such significantly viewed signals are not subject to black out pursuant to the FCC’s network non-duplication rules.  The carriage of two network stations on the same cable system could result in a decline of viewership, adversely affecting the revenues of our owned or programmed stations.  In March 2014, the FCC issued a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, requesting comments on whether it has authority to, and should, eliminate or modify its network non-duplication and/or syndicated exclusivity rules.  This proceeding is pending and we cannot predict when or how the FCC will resolve that rulemaking.
Digital Television
FCC rules provide that television broadcast licensees may use their digital television (DTV) channels for a wide variety of services such as HD television, multiple standard definition television programming, audio, data, and other types of communications, subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standard and further subject to the requirement that broadcasters pay a fee of 5% of gross revenues from any DTV ancillary or supplementary service for which there is a subscription fee or for which the licensee receives a fee from a third party. These rules could impact the profitability related to ancillary or supplementary services provided as discussed within Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform under Operating Strategy above.
Programming and Operations
The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.”  The FCC has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed in the past to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station’s community of license.  FCC licensees continue to be required, however, to present programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of their communities and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness.  Complaints from viewers concerning a station’s programming may be considered by the FCC when it evaluates renewal applications of a licensee, although such complaints may be filed at any time and generally may be considered by the FCC at any time. Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identifications, obscene and indecent broadcasts, and technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation. In addition, television licensees have obligations to create and follow employment outreach programs, provide a minimum amount of programming for children, comply with rules relating to the emergency alert system (EAS), maintain an online public inspection file, and abide by regulations specifying requirements to provide closed captions for its programming. FCC licensees are, in general, responsible for the content of their broadcast programming, including that supplied by television networks.  Accordingly, there is a risk of being fined as a result of our broadcast programming, including network programming.
Other Pending Matters
Congress and the FCC have under consideration, and in the future may consider and adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership, and profitability of our broadcast stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our broadcast stations, and affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions.
On November 16, 2017, the FCC adopted a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking authorizing the voluntary deployment of NEXTGEN TV and adopting rules to afford broadcasters flexibility to deploy NEXTGEN TV based transmissions while minimizing impact on consumers and industry stakeholders and seeking comment on certain additional matters. The Report and Order took effect on March 5, 2018, except for certain rules that required approval from the Office of Management and Budget which became effective on July 17, 2018. On June 3, 2020, the Commission adopted the Second Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration, providing additional guidance to broadcasters deploying NEXTGEN TV. Rule changes associated with the Second Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration became effective on August 17, 2020. On November 9, 2020, the National Association of Broadcasters filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling and Petition for Rulemaking requesting that the FCC (1) clarify that its existing regulatory framework for the hosting of simulcast primary programming streams also applies to simulcast multicast streams, and (2) expand the application of these rules to cover the transmission of ATSC 1.0 multicast streams regardless of whether those streams are simulcast in ATSC 3.0. We cannot predict whether the FCC will grant the petitions or what the outcome of such proceedings would be. 
Other matters that could affect our broadcast properties include technological innovations and developments generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry, such as DTC offerings, direct television broadcast satellite service, Class A television service, the continued establishment of wireless cable systems and low power television stations, digital television technologies, the internet and mobility, and portability of our broadcast signal to hand-held devices.
Congress authorized the FCC to conduct so-called “incentive auctions” to auction and re-purpose broadcast television spectrum for mobile broadband use. In the repacking process associated with the auction, the FCC reassigned some stations to new post-auction channels. Full-power and Class A stations were expected to complete the transition to their post-auction channels in one of ten phases between November 30, 2018 and July 3, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, all of our stations have transitioned to new channels, with two stations operating with special temporary authority at lower power. The legislation authorizing the incentive auction provides the FCC with a $1.75 billion fund to reimburse reasonable costs incurred by stations that are reassigned to new channels in the repack. Congress allocated an additional $1 billion to the reimbursement fund in the FCC Reauthorization Act of 2018. See Broadcast Incentive Auction under Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our participation, results, and post-auction process.
On December 13, 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to initiate the 2018 Quadrennial Regulatory Review of the FCC’s broadcast ownership rules, pursuant to the statutory requirement that the FCC review its media ownership rules every four years to determine whether they remain “necessary in the public interest as the result of competition.” The proposed rulemaking generally seeks comment on, among other things, whether the, the local television ownership rules (including the top-four rule and the eight voices test), should be retained, modified, or eliminated. With respect to the local television ownership rule specifically, among other things, the proposed rulemaking seeks comment on possible modifications to the rule’s operation, including the relevant product market, the numerical limit, the top-four prohibition; and the implications of multicasting, satellite stations, low power stations and the next generation standard. In addition, the proposed rulemaking examines further several diversity related proposals raised in the 2014 Quadrennial Regulatory Review. The public comment period closed on May 29, 2019, and the rulemaking remains pending.
Other Considerations
The preceding summary is not a complete discussion of all provisions of the Communications Act or other congressional acts or of the regulations and policies of the FCC, or in some cases, the DOJ.  For further information, reference should be made to the Communications Act, other congressional acts and regulations, and public notices circulated from time to time by the FCC, or in some cases, the DOJ.  There are additional regulations and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies that govern political broadcasts, advertising, equal employment opportunity, and other matters affecting our business and operations.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Prior to our ownership or operation of our facilities, substances or waste that are, or might be considered, hazardous under applicable environmental laws may have been generated, used, stored, or disposed of at certain of those facilities.  In addition, environmental conditions relating to the soil and groundwater at or under our facilities may be affected by the proximity of nearby properties that have generated, used, stored, or disposed of hazardous substances.  As a result, it is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities in the future in connection with these facilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such environmental requirements and have not in the past been required to incur significant costs in connection therewith, there can be no assurance that our costs to comply with such requirements will not increase in the future or that we will not become subject to new governmental regulations, including those pertaining to potential climate change legislation, that may impose additional restrictions or costs on us.  We presently believe that none of our properties have any condition that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, or consolidated statements of cash flows.
COMPETITION
Our stations and RSNs compete for audience share and advertising revenue with other television stations and cable networks in their markets, as well as with other advertising media such as Distributors, other OTT distributors, cable networks, video on-demand, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, telecommunications providers, direct mail, internet, and other digital media. 

Stations and RSNs compete for audience share primarily on the basis of program popularity, which has a direct effect on advertising rates.  
Our network affiliated stations are largely dependent upon the performance of network provided programs in order to attract viewers. Non-network time periods are programmed by the station primarily with syndicated programs purchased for cash, cash and barter, or barter-only, as well as through self-produced news, public affairs programs, live local sporting events, paid-programming, and other lifestyle and entertainment programming. We also compete for programming which involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Our stations compete for access to those programs against in-market broadcast station competitors for syndicated products and with national cable networks.  Public broadcasting stations generally compete with commercial broadcasters for viewers, but not for advertising dollars.
Competition in the television broadcasting industry occurs primarily in individual DMAs. Generally, a television broadcasting station in one DMA does not compete with stations in other DMAs.  Our stations are located in highly competitive DMAs. Distributors can increase competition for viewership and broadcast television advertising inventory by carrying additional cable network channels within the same DMA as the broadcast television stations. Distributors sell advertising on these cable networks to local advertisers. These narrow cable network channels are typically low rated, and, as a result, advertisements are inexpensive to the local advertisers. Distributors may also connect two or more cable systems together, also called an interconnect, which gives advertisers the option to reach more households in a market with a single buy. In addition, certain of our DMAs are overlapped by over-the-air stations from adjacent DMAs and Distributors of stations from other DMAs, which tends to spread viewership and advertising expenditures over a larger number of television stations. In addition, there is significant increased competition with Google, Facebook, social media, OTT offerings and the multitude of other digital offerings that air video advertisements and sell programmatically to agencies and advertisers. Distributor and OTT offerings have the ability to either blanket the market or target their advertising which broadcast stations do not. 
Because the loyalty of the sports viewing audience to a sports programming network is primarily driven by loyalty to a particular team or teams, access to adequate sources of sports programming is critical to the RSNs. The RSNs compete for telecast rights for teams or events with national or regional cable networks that specialize in or carry sports programming; television ‘‘superstations’’ which distribute sports and other programming by satellite; local and national commercial broadcast television networks; independent syndicators that acquire and resell such rights nationally, regionally and locally; mobile internet providers; and other OTT distributors. Some of these competitors may own or control, or are owned or controlled by, sports teams, leagues or sports promoters, which gives them an advantage in obtaining telecast rights for such teams or sports. Distributors may also contract directly with the sports teams in their local service areas for the right to distribute games on their systems. The RSNs may also compete with Internet-based distributors of sports programming. The increasing amount of sports programming available on a national basis, including pursuant to national rights arrangements, as part of league-controlled sports networks (e.g., NBA TV and NHL Network), and in out-of-market packages (e.g., NBA’s League Pass and NHL Center Ice), may have an adverse impact on the RSNs' competitive position as they compete for distribution and for viewers.
The RSNs also compete with other programming networks to secure desired programming, although some of the RSN programming is generated internally through their efforts in original programming. Competition for programming will increase as the number of programming networks increases. Other programming networks that are affiliated with programming sources such as movie or television studios, film libraries or sports teams may have a competitive advantage over the RSNs in this area.

Advertising rates are based upon factors which include the size of the market in which the station and RSN operate; a program or team's popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to attract; the number of advertisers competing for the available time; the demographic makeup of the market served by the station and RSN; the availability of alternative advertising media in the DMA; the aggressiveness and knowledge of the sales forces in the market to call on and understand their client’s need; and development of projects, features, and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming.  We believe that our sales and programming strategies allow us to compete effectively for advertising revenues within the stations' and RSNs' markets.
Further, the competition of obtaining distribution is highly competitive. Our stations and RSNs face competition from other television stations and cable networks for the right to be carried by a particular distributor, and for the right to be carried on the service tier that will attract the most subscribers. Once one of our stations or RSNs obtains distribution, that network competes for viewers not only with the other channels available through the distributor, but also with over-the-air television, pay-per-view channels and video-on-demand channels, as well as online services, mobile services, radio, print, streaming services, and other sources of media and information, sporting events and entertainment. Important to our success in each area of competition the station and RSN faces are the price the station or RSN charges for its carriage; the quantity, quality and variety of programming offered and the effectiveness of its marketing efforts.
Our stations' and RSNs' ability to successfully compete with other television stations and cable networks for distribution may be hampered because the Distributors, through which distribution is sought, may be affiliated with other television stations or cable networks. Those Distributors may place their affiliated television station or cable network on a more desirable tier, thereby giving the affiliated television station or cable network a competitive advantage over our stations' or RSNs' own programming. 

Moreover, technology advances and regulatory changes affecting programming delivery through fiber optic lines, video compression, and new wireless uses could lower entry barriers for new video channels and encourage the further development of increasingly specialized “niche” programming.  Telephone companies are permitted to provide video distribution services, on a common carrier basis, as “cable systems” or as “open video systems,” each pursuant to different regulatory schemes.  Additionally, OTT services allow consumers to consume programming on-demand through access to the Internet and without a subscription with a Distributor. We continue to compete with the OTT services for viewership.
DTV technology allows our stations to provide viewers multiple channels of digital television over each of our existing standard digital channels, to provide certain programming in HD television format and to deliver other channels of information in the forms of data and programming to the internet, PCs, smart phones, tablet computers, and mobile and streaming devices.  These additional capabilities may provide us with additional sources of revenue, as well as additional competition.
The financial success of our stations' and RSNs' also depends in part upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, the strength of the advertising market, the quality and appeal of competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities.
We believe we compete favorably against other television stations and cable networks because of our management skill and experience, our ability historically to generate revenue share greater than our audience share, our network affiliations and program service arrangements, and our local program acceptance.  In addition, we believe that we benefit from the operation of multiple broadcast and network properties, affording us certain non-quantifiable economies of scale and competitive advantages in the purchase of programming.
HUMAN CAPITAL

We believe that our ability to attract and retain the best employees is a cornerstone of our vision of connecting people with content everywhere. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 11,600 employees, including part-time and temporary employees. Approximately 2,000 employees are represented by labor unions under certain collective bargaining agreements. 
Corporate Culture
We are committed to maintaining a safe, ethical, and harassment free workplace. We recognize that our success as a team, and in our communications with one another, is grounded in our ability to trust team members to be fully engaged and to do the right thing. We support trusting relationships by offering clear guidance, structure, resources, and accountability. To this end, we maintain governance policies that apply to all of our directors, officers, and employees, including a code of business conduct and ethics, employee safety program, and no harassment and open-door policies. These policies are intended to help identify, provide mechanisms for reporting, and provide a framework for solving potential issues. These policies are reviewed and updated by management, together with the Board, as our needs grow and change and upon stakeholder feedback and changes in applicable laws, regulations, and stock exchange requirements.
We value and support diversity and inclusion at all levels. Diversity and inclusion have been fundamental from our very beginning and we take pride in being an equal opportunity employer. Diversity, inclusion, equal employment opportunity, and strong anti-discrimination policies go hand-in-hand and efforts related to one area complement other areas. Our Diversity and Inclusion Statement establishes clarity and alignment throughout our organization, at all levels, regarding how we connect with each other by embracing diversity and promoting inclusion among our employees, viewers, and customers. All employees are asked to honor the intent of our Diversity and Inclusion Statement in their daily activities and decisions and are required to take part in workplace diversity training.
Over several decades, our local television stations have built recruiting and outreach programs that encourage diversity in our workforce. Our activities are designed to ensure broad outreach to potential applicants by widely disseminating information concerning job vacancies, providing notification to community groups, attending diverse job fairs, participating in other various recruitment outreach activities, and providing training to managers on equal employment opportunity and illegal discrimination.
Employee Engagement
We regularly gather feedback from employees to gain an understanding of and improve our employee experience and to foster an engaged workforce. This feedback is used to help create new, and refine existing, employee related programs and processes. Most recently, we gathered results from a company-wide Remote Work Survey in order to gain insights about our business during the COVID-19 pandemic. 90% of responding employees agreed that they have been well-supported during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our Innovation project is a strategic lever that drives revenue, reduces waste, and engages employees to serve our customers and shareholders as a pioneer in the industry. We believe that the "next big idea" could come from anyone, anywhere and so, in 2020 began an effort to gather innovation ideas from employees company-wide. At our third annual Innovation Summit in November 2020, we brought together over 120 innovators to learn, expand our thinking, celebrate, and spark new and different ideas.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is vital to our success. We maintain and continuously enhance affordable health care and recently reduced the waiting period for benefits to begin for new employees, improved paid time off benefits, and expanded the use of sick leave to allow for when employees cannot work due to child or dependent care issues. We continuously work to improve our practices, policies, and benefits to make meaningful impacts on our employees professional and personal lives. We also sponsor an employee assistance program aimed at enhancing the physical well-being, as well as the financial and mental well-being, of our employees.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols to protect our employees, including many of our employees continuing to work remotely while employees who cannot work remotely continue to follow strict Center for Disease Control protocols such as physical distancing, monitoring and daily reporting on the health and symptoms of employees and members of the employees’ households, wearing face coverings, limiting interaction, and limiting non-essential travel.
Compensation
Our employee compensation includes market-competitive pay, a 401(k) plan, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare benefits, paid time off and family leave, and employer paid life and disability insurance. We continue to improve upon our compensation offerings. Recently, we increased the number of hours of eligible vacation time rollover, increased our 401(k) match for all employees, and increased our minimum hourly wage to $15 for all applicable employees, including all employees whose minimum wage was previously tied to state and federal mandates. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we allowed eligible employees to cash out up to 40 vacation hours to assist with family hardships and we established a multimillion-dollar emergency fund to provide support to our RSN freelancers, as the cancellation of certain live sports deprived these freelancers of work.
PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Our business primarily relates to providing content to consumers digitally, which has minimal environmental impact, but we recognize that we all have a role to play in protecting the environment. We produce high quality news to increase our viewers' general awareness of environmental issues and programs by providing them information on how they can participate in improving environmental sustainability. Our corporate offices and stations participate in sustainability initiatives, such as proactively replacing lights with LED bulbs, reducing the use of paper products, and, whenever possible, recycling paper products and using automation systems to better manage HVAC systems. Additionally, in relation to the FCC's National Broadband Plan spectrum repack process and general updates, we have installed over 100 new, energy efficient television transmitters. These updated transmitters are typically 25% more energy efficient than the units that they replace and generate less waste heat, which allows for a reduction of air conditioning systems at the transmitter sites.
