Nevertheless, the same report concludes that, at this level of funding, the nation will still face an unmet infrastructure investment gap through 2031 of $2.6 trillion. By 2039, a continued underinvestment in the nation’s infrastructure at current rates will cost $10 trillion in GDP, as well as more than 3 million jobs and $2.4 trillion in exports by 2039. By 2039, America’s overdue infrastructure bill will cost the average American household $3,300 a year, or $63 a week.

In December 2020, Utility Management and Construction completed 1500 smart meter installations across the state of Oklahoma. Along with its subsidiary, Cross-Bo Construction, LLC, both companies have completed over 50,000 feet of water line installations and are now bidding on multiple proposals with Municipalities reopening the bidding process, giving Utility management and Cross-Bo potential increased revenue opportunities in 2021. 
 
Our Future Plans 
 
Over the next 24 months, we will attempt to expand our business and service offerings, as follows: 
 

· | Expand our Infrastructure Services, developing relationships with municipalities, utilities, and construction companies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Through Cross-Bo, should it be successful in is planned rollout of 5G mobile telecommunications services, develop and market those 5G services through an expanded geographic area, initially into Kansas and Missouri.
· | Capitalize on infrastructure expansion project in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Capitalize on ATT’s 5G expansion in the Midwest to provide support Infrastructure Services. 
· | Acquire private companies in the Infrastructure Services area. 
· | Seek strategic partnerships and/or revenue sharing opportunities in the niche infrastructure technology solutions area. . 

 
With all of our acquisitions, we intend to focus on post-transaction integration and business improvements, including through cross-selling opportunities and the leveraging of operational efficiencies through a central platform of finance, legal and human resources capabilities.
 
These solutions will provide our Infrastructure Services business with a potential competitive advantage and will enable us to develop and commercialize new services and products. We intend to continue to invest in the development of additional platform capabilities, including capabilities relating to smart IoT sensors and to help create niche “smart infrastructure” solutions for clients.
 
There are no assurances that we will be successful in any of the above described business plans. 
 
Technology-Enabled Infrastructure Solutions
 
We believe that the infrastructure and infrastructure services industries are starting to adopt new technology solutions to deliver cost savings and compliance adherence. As a result, we believe that smart utility products will provide our Infrastructure Services business with a significant competitive advantage. Similarly, we believe that our Infrastructure Services business will provide our Technology Solutions business with insights from a broad range of infrastructure clients, helping to guide the development of our technology products. We believe our technology platform coupled with our infrastructure client relationships and insights will enable us to develop and commercialize new services and products faster than if we were either an infrastructure services-only, or a technology solutions-only, business. We also expect that sustained operational and business development activities across our businesses will accelerate the commercial penetration of our technology solutions into the infrastructure markets we already serve.
Business Strategies 
 
Our goal is to provide innovative, market-leading solutions for the public and private infrastructure services industry, in particular where new technologies can enhance conventional service and product offerings, for revenue generating opportunities, economies of scale and potential improved operating result. which we plan to achieve our goal through the implementation of the following strategies:

· | Acquire Complementary Companies. We plan to selectively acquire companies that expand our existing operations, can leverage their businesses using our existing platform and are accretive to long-term stockholder value. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Potential Increased Revenue from Existing Clients. We intend to expand our relationships with our existing clients and increase their business with us by cross selling our technology solutions and infrastructure services, including in multiple markets in the U.S. and globally. 
· | Attract New Clients. We intend to invest in sales and business development efforts, including to expand the geographies in which we sell our infrastructure services and technology solutions. For example, Cross-Bo is licensed in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri, and is currently targeting specific projects relating to the 5G telecommunications rollout, a new opportunity in the Midwest and throughout the United States. Additionally, UMMC is utilizing multiple infrastructure management software tools for use in its rural utility management program.
· | Continuously Improve Operations. We intend to continually improve our operations, including reducing costs and increasing productivity, initially through the centralization of shared management services in our parent company. Selectively Invest in Technology and New Services and Products. We intend to invest in our technology and infrastructure platforms to serve the evolving needs of our clients. 

Competition
 
There are many competitors in the sales of personal protection equipment and infrastructure services that have greater assets, revenues, operational resources and financial resources then we do. 
 
We believe there is a significant market opportunity to build a leading infrastructure-focused business that facilitates industry consolidation and delivers cost-effective infrastructure services and technology solutions.
 

Large and Growing Client Market 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Essential Nature of Infrastructure Services Multiple opportunities in the rural footprint we currently operate in One stop service company offering utility management and installation

 
Infrastructure services are often essential expenditures for municipal governments and others. We believe that the essential nature of infrastructure services for many clients and potential clients will result in long-term growth opportunities and also help generate stable revenue streams over the economic cycle.
 
Highly Fragmented Provider Market
 
The U.S. has a large number of small and medium-sized companies providing infrastructure services to public and private customers on a local or regional basis. We believe that many of these companies are closely held or family-owned and -run, whose owners may have few exit opportunities. In addition, we believe that many of these companies need and want to align with larger and better capitalized platforms, potentially resulting in opportunities for our focused acquisition strategy.
Increasing Adoption of New Technologies
 
Many municipalities, utilities and other market participants are in the early stages of adopting new technologies to monitor and support their infrastructure, such as geospatial mapping and remote sensor technology. These new technology solutions have the potential to increase productivity in, and reduce costs associated with, construction, maintenance, and related activities.
