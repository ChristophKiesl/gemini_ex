DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
General
 
MedMen is a cannabis retailer based in the U.S. with flagship locations in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Chicago. MedMen offers a robust selection of high-quality products, including MedMen-owned brands, LuxLyte, and MedMen Red through its premium retail stores, proprietary delivery service, as well as curbside and in-store pick up.
 
As of September 15, 2021, the Company operates 23 store locations across California (12), Florida (6), Nevada (3), Illinois (1), and Arizona (1). The Company’s retail stores are located in strategic locations across key cities and neighborhoods in each of its markets. The Company has plans to open additional retail stores over the next 12 months, including, but not limited to the following cities:
 

● | San Francisco, CA 
--+------------------------
● | Morton Grove, IL 
● | Boston, MA 
● | Newton, MA 
● | Miami - South Beach, FL
● | Jacksonville, FL 
● | Deerfield Beach, FL 
● | Tampa, FL 
● | Sarasota, FL 
● | Tallahassee, FL

The Company expects to continue strengthening its pipeline of stores through acquisitions, partnerships and applications for new licenses, with a focus on recreational states such as California, Nevada, Arizona, Illinois and Massachusetts and medical states such as Florida.
 
In addition to expanding its physical store network in markets across the U.S., the Company plans to continue scaling its digital platform. The Company launched statewide same-day delivery in California in August 2019 and launched delivery in Nevada in September 2019. See “Retail Operations - In-Store Pickup and Delivery” for further information about the Company’s delivery operations.
 
The Company launched MedMen Buds, the Company’s loyalty program in July 2019. The program currently is offered in all of the Company’s stores in Arizona, Nevada, Florida, and California and has more than 500,000 members. See “Retail Operations - Loyalty Program” for further information about the Company’s loyalty program.
 
MedMen currently operates five cultivation and production facilities across Nevada, California, New York, Florida and Arizona. In California and Nevada, the Company is in discussions for the potential sublease of its cultivation and production facilities so that the Company can focus on its retail operations. The Company has not entered into any definitive agreements at this time. The Company currently intends to sub-lease the California and Nevada facilities to a third party that would acquire and/or take over the operations for the cultivation and production facilities. As a result, the Company would no longer operate cultivation and production facilities in California and Nevada.
 
In New York and Florida, the cultivation and production facilities are or will be focused primarily on the commercialization of cannabis (both medical and recreational, as permitted under applicable laws) and, in select locations, the research and development of new strains of cannabis and cultivation techniques. The procedures at each facility place an emphasis on customer and patient safety, with a strict quality control process. See “Description of the Business - Cultivation and Production Operations” for further information about the Company’s cultivation and production operations.
 
The Company currently holds licenses within California, Nevada, Florida, Arizona, Illinois, and Massachusetts. Pursuant to an investment agreement entered into in February 2021, the Company is currently in the process of transferring the licenses its holds within New York, which are subject to regulatory approval. The Company views Nevada, California, Illinois, Florida and Massachusetts as providing ongoing opportunities for growth due to their market depth, current supply-demand dynamics and regulatory framework.
 
In addition to owning its own cannabis licenses and operations, the Company also provides management services to third-party cannabis license-holders. The Company currently has management services contracts at two licensed retail dispensaries in California. See “Management Services” for further information about the Company’s management services.
 
The Company is operated by an executive team that has significant experience in the cannabis industry and other analogous industries such as retail, technology, consumer packaged goods, alcohol and apparel.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Management expects the legalization of cannabis throughout the United States to continue to expand both recreationally and medically. In the United States, 18 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, have legalized cannabis for recreational purposes or “adult-use”. These states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. In these markets, recreational sales are expected to grow as cannabis retailers, as permitted by law, benefit from a shift in consumers from illegal sales to legal sales and from new cannabis consumers. MedMen plans on capitalizing on the projected increase in cannabis consumption in these recreational markets through both an expansion of its retail footprint in markets such as California, Nevada, Arizona, Illinois and Massachusetts, as well an entry into other sizable recreational markets across the U.S.
 
With respect to medical marijuana, as more research centers study the effects of cannabis-based products in treating or addressing therapeutic needs, and assuming that research findings demonstrate that such products are effective in doing so, management believes that the size of the U.S. medical cannabis market will also continue to grow as more states expand their medical marijuana programs and new states legalize medical marijuana. In the United States, 37 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have legalized medical cannabis. Given MedMen’s experience in New York and Florida, we believe that MedMen is well-versed in operating within a medical-only market and will continue to seek opportunities to expand. These markets provide the Company a national platform to execute on its medical strategy, allowing the Company to serve both medical and recreational consumers.

Retail Operations
 
MedMen prides itself on providing a best in class, inclusive and informative environment where the customer can comfortably navigate its extensive selection of cannabis products with the assistance of highly trained employees.
 
MedMen operates its retail operations through a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries in California, Nevada, Florida, Arizona, and Illinois. MedMen currently operates 12 retail stores in California, one retail store in Arizona, three retail stores in Nevada, and one retail store in Illinois, all of which serve both recreational and medical marijuana patients, and six retail stores in Florida that serve medical marijuana patients. Of the Company’s 12 retail stores in California, the Company owns and operates 10 retail stores and manages the operations of two through long-term management services agreements. The Company previously intended to sell its assets in Arizona; however, following the passage and expeditious roll-out of adult-use sales in Arizona, the Company reclassified its Arizona operations from discontinued to continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 
In February 2021, in connection with an investment agreement whereby Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC will obtain a controlling interest in the Company’s New York subsidiary, MedMen NY, Inc. (“MMNY”), MMNY entered into a management agreement pursuant to which Ascend will advise on MMNY’s operations pending regulatory approval of the investment transaction. Accordingly, four retail locations within the state of New York have been classified as discontinued operations.
 
Expanding upon its omni-channel experience, the Company launched its same-day delivery platform in California in August 2019 and in September 2019, MedMen’s delivery service was launched in Nevada. Over time, the Company expects to expand its delivery service in each of its states, where permissible by the regulatory framework. Delivery service is available seven days a week, 365 days a year. Both MedMen Buds and MedMen Delivery cement the Company’s commitment to continuously evolving the consumer experience.
 
Real Estate Strategy
 
MedMen is focused on entering geographic markets which it believes has significant demand potential for cannabis (assessed through industry research, such as financial analyst reports covering the cannabis industry and consumer and retail information from data providers, and management estimates, such as top-down estimates that evaluate the total addressable market (factoring in potential penetration of cannabis consumption within a specific market) as well as using the Company’s own store performance in similar markets to evaluate potential revenue and profitability), and high barriers to entry, such as limited retail licenses, zoning restrictions and licensing requirements. MedMen’s real estate strategy is focused on prime locations with significant foot traffic and proximity to popular attractions (restaurants, malls, sports arenas, hotels, etc.). MedMen targets retail spaces with a footprint of 2,000 to 5,000 square feet, depending on the market and available real estate. MedMen utilizes both its internal real estate team and a network of real estate brokers to negotiate leases on behalf of the Company. MedMen typically prefers to secure long-term leases for its store locations instead of acquiring real estate. Where leasing of the applicable property is not possible, the Company will generally seek a financing partner to assign the purchase and sale agreement to prior to closing and after the Company has secured the license, and then enter into a leaseback transaction with that purchaser.
Branding and Marketing
 
MedMen utilizes consistent branding and messaging across its dispensaries under the “MedMen” name. In order to support its retail operations, MedMen has a dedicated marketing team that engages potential customers through in-store demos, social media and promotions, including the MedMen Buds loyalty program, which is described below.
 
MedMen continues to focus on growing market share and allocating capital to maximize shareholder value, which begins with providing a superior retail experience for its consumers. This includes building and supporting spaces where customers feel safe and educated, while discovering the benefits of cannabis.
 
The Company curates unique cannabis products and resources that reflect the interests of its customers.
 
MedMen works diligently to identify emerging cannabis trends and influencers within beauty, wellness, fashion, sports, and entertainment lifestyle verticals. As cannabis gains popularity across these categories, MedMen aims to become a leading lifestyle destination for the next-generation cannabis consumer.
 
In order to continue enhancing its customer experience, the Company launched MedMen Buds, a rewards program that encompasses over 500,000 individual participants and continues to grow daily, with members across California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada. MedMen understands that in the current retail landscape, building loyalty with core customers is a key driver of continued growth. The Company’s understanding of what its customers value, and how it can meet those needs is critical in deepening its connection with its core customers.
 
Creating a true omni-channel experience for customers has been a priority for the Company since its inception. In support of that endeavor, the Company successfully launched a fully-owned and operated delivery service in the California and Nevada markets. MedMen is held to the highest standard as it releases “first-to-market” goods and services to cannabis consumers, and as such, the Company takes great pride in the initial positive feedback towards its enhanced omni-channel offering.

Banking and Processing
 
MedMen deposits funds from its dispensary operations into its banking partners in each respective market. The banks are fully aware of the nature of MedMen’s business and continue to remain supportive of MedMen’s growth plans. MedMen’s dispensaries currently accept only cash and debit card and do not process credit card payments. The Company believes that, as regulations continue to evolve, over time most forms of payment will be accepted, however, it is unclear exactly when this may occur.
Product Selection and Offerings
 
Product selection decisions are currently made by MedMen’s team of buyers, which negotiates and receives bids from potential brand vendors across all product categories including flower, vape pens, oils, extracts, edibles and pre-rolls. MedMen bases its product selection decisions on product quality, margin potential, consumer feedback and the ability for the respective brands to scale.
 
MedMen currently sells its own branded products in California, Nevada, New York and Florida under MedMen RED and LuxLyte brands. MedMen manufactures its own products in New York and Florida, and expects to leverage contract manufacturers in California, Nevada and Illinois for its own branded products.
 
MedMen’s retail locations in California, Illinois, and Nevada make available a variety of MedMen and third party (resale) cannabis and cannabis products. Cannabis and cannabis products for sale include but are not limited to: cannabis dry flower, concentrated cannabis oil, vaporizer forms of cannabis, cannabis edible products and other cannabis products.
 
MedMen is approved in New York to produce tinctures, vaporizers, cartridges and gel capsules. MedMen currently produces five THC:CBD ratios for tinctures and gel capsules in Wellness (0:1), Harmony (1:1), Awake (20:1), Calm (50:1) and Sleep (100:1). MedMen produces 14 vaporizers in Awake (20:1), Calm (50:1), Harmony (1:1) and Sleep (100:1) THC:CBD ratios. It provides nine cartridges in the same ratios as its vaporizers, in addition to Gold (250:1). MedMen offers a total of 33 products at each of its retail locations in New York.
 
Product Pricing
 
MedMen’s prices vary based on the market conditions and product pricing of vendor partners. Generally, MedMen strives to keep pricing consistent across all store locations within a state. Cannabis product pricing is usually based on operating costs, materials costs, distribution costs, and quality and strength of ingredients.
 
The states of California, Nevada, Florida, Illinois and Massachusetts do not regulate pricing and licensed dispensing organizations within such states may set their own prices for cannabis and cannabis products. The state of New York does regulate pricing of all approved medical marijuana products.
 
Notwithstanding that most of the foregoing states do not regulate pricing of cannabis and cannabis products permitted to be sold in such states, many of them impose taxes on the sale of permitted products, as follows.
 

● | Arizona – Subject to a 16% cannabis excise, a local cannabis excise tax which varies by city and/or county of up to 6.3% and sales tax. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | California – Subject to a 15% cannabis excise tax, a local cannabis excise tax which varies by city and/or county, and state sales tax of 7.25% with an additional local sales tax of up to 3%. 
● | Nevada – Subject to a 10% cannabis excise and 8.375% sales tax. 
● | New York – Medical cannabis is subject to a 7% cannabis excise payable by the cultivation facility, which is then included in the retail price of the products by the Company. 
● | Florida – Not currently subject to an excise or sales tax. 
● | Illinois – Medical cannabis is subject to state and local retailers’ occupation taxes at the same rate as other qualifying drugs, i.e., 1% State Retailers’ Occupation Tax rate and is generally exempt from locally imposed retailers’ occupation taxes (except for Regional Transportation Authority and Metro-East Transit District retailers’ occupation taxes). Recreational cannabis sales are subject to the following cannabis excise and sales tax structure:


o | 10% of taxable receipts from the sale of adult use cannabis, other than cannabis- infused products, sold with 35% THC or less; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | 25% of taxable receipts from the sale of adult use cannabis, other than cannabis- infused products, sold with greater than 35% THC;

§ | Up to 3.75% in unincorporated areas of the county; and

§ | Up to 3% in a municipality located in a county. 

 
In-Store Pickup and Delivery
 
MedMen offers in-store pickup in most retail locations, accessible from MedMen’s website. Measures to enhance this offering and expand its availability into certain of the Company’s other operating states, where permitted under applicable laws and regulations, are underway.
 
The Company launched statewide same-day delivery in California in August 2019.
 
Loyalty Program
 
MedMen launched its loyalty program, MedMen Buds, in July 2019. In addition to providing exclusive access to sales and discounts, members of MedMen Buds earn points for every purchase that lead to rewards. MedMen Buds is currently live in all of the Company’s stores across California, Nevada, Florida and Arizona and counts over 500,000 members.
Inventory Management
 
MedMen has comprehensive inventory management procedures, which are compliant with applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, and other requirements. These procedures ensure strict control over MedMen’s cannabis and cannabis product inventory from delivery by a licensed distributor to sale or delivery to a consumer, or disposal as cannabis waste. Such inventory management procedures also include measures to prevent contamination and maintain the safety and quality of the products dispensed at MedMen’s retail locations. MedMen understands its responsibility to the greater community and the environment and is committed to providing consumers with a consistent and high-quality supply of cannabis.
Managed Dispensaries
 
MedMen uses the same proprietary, best-practices policies and procedures in both owned and managed dispensaries in order to ensure systematic operations and consistent customer experience. By design, a customer or employee should notice no distinct differences between owned and managed stores. Additionally, MedMen enters into long-term management services agreements, as further described under “Management Services” below.
 
Cultivation and Production Operations
 
MedMen currently operates five cultivation and production facilities across Nevada, California, New York, Florida and Arizona. Given the regulatory environment and lack of robust wholesale market in Florida and New York, the Company expects to continue cultivation and production activities in that market. In California and Nevada, the Company is in discussions with partners who may operate its cultivation and production facilities so it can focus on retail operations. The Company may sub-lease the California and Nevada facilities to a third party that would acquire and/or take over the operations for the cultivation and production facilities. As a result, the Company would no longer operate cultivation and production facilities in California and Nevada. The Company also operates a cultivation and production facility in Arizona.
 
In New York and Florida, the cultivation and production facilities are or will be focused primarily on the commercialization of cannabis (both medical and recreational, as permitted under applicable laws) and, in select locations, the research and development of new strains of cannabis and cultivation techniques. The procedures at each facility place an emphasis on customer and patient safety, with a strict quality control process. In February 2021, the Company entered into an investment agreement with respect to its New York operations whereby a controlling interest will be acquired by a third party. Accordingly, the operations within the state of New York have been classified as discontinued operations but the Company will continue to advise on the New York operations pending regulatory approval of the investment transaction.
 
Nevada (Mustang)
 
MedMen operates a cultivation and production facility in northern Nevada. The combined facility is comprised of a 30,000 square foot cultivation facility and a 15,000 square foot production facility and sits on a total of 4.27 acres of land. The 30,000 square foot high-tech Dutch hybrid greenhouse allows for 22,000 square feet of canopy space. The production facility includes state-of-the-art production and extraction equipment.

California (Desert Hot Springs)
 
MedMen operates a cultivation and production facility in Desert Hot Springs, California. The combined facility is comprised of a 30,000 square foot cultivation facility and a 15,000 square foot production facility and its design is based on the Mustang facility.
New York (Utica)
 
MedMen operates a cultivation and production facility in Utica, New York in order to service medical marijuana patients in the state through its master license, which allows for cultivation, production and retail sales.
Florida (Eustis)
 
MedMen operates a cultivation and production facility in Eustis, Florida, which is approximately an hour’s drive north from Orlando.
 
Arizona (Mesa)
 
The Company operates a 20,000 square foot cultivation and production facility in Mesa, Arizona.
 
Management Services
 
In addition to owning its own retail licenses, MedMen has signed long-term management services contracts with third-party license owners seeking MedMen’s management services. Management services include the use of the “MedMen” brand, retail operations support, human resources, finance and accounting, marketing, sales, legal and compliance. MedMen currently has two management services agreements in place with license owners in California. The two managed dispensaries are located in Venice Beach (Abbot Kinney) and the Los Angeles Airport area.
 
The management services agreements are typically 30 years in length with 10-year renewals and significant penalties if an operator sells its interest in a managed licensed entity (20% of net sale price of licensee with respect to a change of control transaction). The management services agreements currently in place comprise of the following fees: (i) 1.5% of gross revenue for marketing and soft costs, (ii) $20,000 per month shared services fee, (iii) 25% of monthly EBITDA, (iv) 1.5% of construction budget for construction design services, and (v) 5% of construction budget for construction management services.
 
Employees
 
As of June 26, 2021, MedMen had approximately 875 employees across its operating jurisdictions, of which approximately 600 were full-time employees and approximately 125 of which were employed at the corporate level. The remaining employees are employed at retail, cultivation, production, quality assurance/quality control and supply chain/distribution.
 
MedMen is committed to:
 

● | Providing equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants: These policies extend to all aspects of MedMen’s employment practices, including but not limited to, recruiting, hiring, discipline, termination, promotions, transfers, compensation, benefits, training, leaves of absence, and other terms and conditions of employment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Providing a work environment that is free of unlawful harassment, discrimination and retaliation: In furtherance of this commitment, MedMen strictly prohibits all forms of unlawful discrimination and harassment. 
● | Complying with all laws protecting qualified individuals with disabilities, as well as employees’, independent contractors’ and vendors’ religious beliefs and observances. 

 
MedMen is committed to all of the above without regards to race, ethnicity, religion, color, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, uniform service member and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, age, protected medical condition, genetic information, disability, or any other protected status in accordance with all applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws.
 
MedMen’s employees are highly-talented individuals who have educational achievements ranging from Ph.D, Masters, and undergraduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines, as well as staff who have been trained on the job to uphold the highest standards as set by MedMen. It is a requirement that all of MedMen’s employees pass background checks and drug screening. MedMen recruits, hires and promotes individuals that are best qualified for each position, priding itself on using a selection process that recruits people who are trainable, cooperative and share its core values as a company.
 
In addition, the safety of MedMen’s employees is a priority and MedMen is committed to the prevention of illness and injury through the provision and maintenance of a healthy workplace. MedMen takes all reasonable steps to ensure staff is appropriately informed and trained to ensure the safety of themselves as well as others around them.

MedMen partners with the United Food and Commercial Workers (the “UFCW”). The UFCW is a national labor union that represents cannabis workers throughout the United States. The eligible staff of all current retail locations of MedMen in California is represented by the UFCW. MedMen entered into a collective bargaining agreement with UFCW Local 770 and its sister locals in Southern California in 2018 and has expanded that relationship to include UFCW Local 5 in Northern California. In New York, MedMen has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, a division of the UFCW, which represents MedMen’s cultivation and retail staff in New York state.
 
Competition
 
With respect to retail operations, MedMen expects to compete with other retail license holders across the states in which it operates, and additional states, as it expands its retail operations into those states either organically or by way of acquisition. Many of MedMen’s competitors in the markets in which MedMen operates in are small local operators. In certain markets such as Los Angeles, there are also a number of illegally operating dispensaries, which serve as competition. In addition to physical dispensaries, MedMen also competes with third-party delivery services, which provide direct-to-consumer delivery services.
 
Further, as more U.S. jurisdictions pass state legislation allowing recreational use of cannabis, the Company expects an increased level of competition in the U.S. market. For example, since January 1, 2018, the legalization of recreational cannabis in California has spurred an increase of new entrants. A number of companies listed on the CSE are expanding operations to states that have decriminalized cannabis consumption. The increasingly competitive U.S. state markets may adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Company.
 
Intellectual Property
 
MedMen has developed numerous proprietary technologies and processes. These proprietary technologies and processes include its seed-to-sale software, cultivation and extraction techniques, and cultivation equipment and irrigation systems. While actively exploring the patentability of these techniques and processes, MedMen relies on non-disclosure/confidentiality arrangements and trade secret protection.
 
MedMen has invested significant resources towards developing a recognizable and unique brand consistent with premium, high-end retailers in analogous industries. To date, MedMen has 13 registered federal trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, two registered trademarks in Canada, two trademark applications in Israel, six registered trademarks in Mexico, one registered trademark in California, 17 registered trademarks in Nevada, five registered trademarks in Florida and three registered trademarks in New York. All U.S. federal registered trademarks are further described below.
 
MedMen’s in-house and outside legal counsel monitor and swiftly respond to potential intellectual property infringement. Additionally, MedMen maintains strict standards and operating procedures regarding its intellectual property, including the regular use of non-disclosure, confidentiality, and intellectual property assignment agreements.

UNITED STATES REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
 
Federal Regulatory Environment
 
The federal government of the United States regulates controlled substances through the CSA, which places controlled substances on one of five schedules. Currently, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. A Schedule I controlled substance means the Drug Enforcement Agency considers it to have a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical treatment, and a lack of accepted safety for the use of it even under medical supervision. The federal government has sought to provide guidance to enforcement agencies and banking institutions with the introduction of the United States Department of Justice Memorandum drafted by former Deputy Attorney General James Michael Cole in 2013 (the “Cole Memo”) and the Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) guidance in 2014.
 
The Cole Memo offered guidance to federal enforcement agencies as to how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states. The Cole Memo acknowledged that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, several states had enacted laws authorizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes. The Cole Memo noted that jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis. As such, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to implicate the Cole Memo’s enforcement priorities. The Department of Justice did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the Cole Memo. In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memo concluded that the Department of Justice should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis, such as distribution of cannabis from states where cannabis is legal to those where cannabis is illegal, the diversion of cannabis revenues to illicit drug cartels and sales of cannabis to minors.
 
In January 2018, then United States Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, by way of issuance of a new Department of Justice Memorandum (the “Sessions Memo”), rescinded the Cole Memo and thereby created a vacuum of guidance for enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice. The Sessions Memorandum explains the DOJ’s rationale for rescinding all past DOJ cannabis enforcement guidance, claiming that Obama-era enforcement policies are “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance adopted in the 1980s, in chapter 9.27.230 of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (the “USAM”). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memo, are based on the use of the federal government’s limited resources and include “law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General,” the “seriousness” of the alleged crimes, the “deterrent effect of criminal prosecution,” and “the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” Although the Sessions Memorandum emphasizes that cannabis is a federally illegal Schedule I controlled substance, it does not otherwise instruct U.S. Attorneys to consider the prosecution of cannabis-related offenses a DOJ priority, and in practice, most U.S. Attorneys have not changed their prosecutorial approach to date. As a result, federal prosecutors are free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities despite the existence of state-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memo as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and as a result it is uncertain how active federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities.
 
On March 11, 2021, Merrick Garland was sworn in as the U.S. Attorney General. During his campaign, President Biden stated a policy goal to decriminalize possession of cannabis at the federal level, but he has not publicly supported the full legalization of cannabis. In response to questions posed by Senator Cory Booker, Merrick Garland stated during February 2021 congressional testimony that he would reinstitute a version of the Cole Memorandum. He reiterated the statement that the Justice Department under his leadership would not pursue cases against Americans “complying with the laws in states that have legalized and are effectively regulating marijuana”, in written responses to the Senate Judiciary Committee provided around March 1. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Justice Garland indicated at a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate that it did not seem to him to be a useful use of limited resources to pursue prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. It is unclear what impact, if any, the new administration will have on U.S. federal government enforcement policy on cannabis. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that the position of the Department of Justice will not change.

Because the Department of Justice memorandums serve as discretionary agency guidance and do not constitute a force of law, cannabis related businesses have worked to continually renew the Rohrabacher Blumenauer Appropriations Amendment (originally the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment) that has been included in federal annual spending bills since 2014. This amendment restricts the Department of Justice from using federals funds to prevent states with medical cannabis regulations from implementing laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state and local law. Most recently, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, which was signed by President Trump on February 14, 2019 and funds the departments of the federal government through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. In signing the Act, President Trump issued a signing statement noting that the Act “provides that the DOJ may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories,” and further stating “I will treat this provision consistent with the President’s constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.” While the signing statement can fairly be read to mean that the executive branch intends to enforce the CSA and other federal laws prohibiting the sale and possession of medical marijuana, the president did issue a similar signing statement in 2017 and no major federal enforcement actions followed. On September 27, 2019, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment was temporarily renewed through a stopgap spending bill and was similarly renewed again on November 21, 2019. The Fiscal Year 2020 omnibus spending bill was ultimately passed on December 20, 2019, making the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment effective through September 30, 2020. In signing the spending bill, President Trump again released a statement similar to the ones he made May 2017 and February 2019 regarding the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment. On December 27, 2020 the amendment was renewed through the signing of the Fiscal Year 2021 omnibus spending bill, effective through September 30, 2021. Notably, Rohrbacher-Farr has applied only to medical marijuana programs and has not provided the same protections to enforcement against adult-use activities. If the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment is no longer in effect, the risk of federal enforcement and override of state marijuana laws would increase.
 
Since 2014, Congress has made immense strides in marijuana policy. The bipartisan Congressional Cannabis Caucus launched in 2017 and is headed by Representatives Dana Rohrabacher (CA-48), Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Don Young (AK-At Large), and Jared Polis (CO-02). The group is “dedicated to developing policy reforms that bridge the gap between federal laws banning marijuana and the laws in an ever-growing number of states that have legalized it for medical or recreational purposes” Additionally, each year more Representatives and Senators sign on and co-sponsor marijuana legalization bills including the CARERS Act, REFER Act and others. While there are different perspectives on the most effective route to end federal marijuana prohibition, Congressman Blumenauer and Senator Wyden introduced the three-bill package, Path to Marijuana Reform which would fix Section 280E of the Code, eliminate civil asset forfeiture and federal criminal penalties for businesses complying with state law, reduce barriers to banking, and would de-schedule, tax and regulate marijuana in 2017. Senator Booker has also introduced the Marijuana Justice Act, which would deschedule marijuana, and in 2018 Congresswoman Barbara Lee introduced the House companion.
 
Additionally, on June 7, 2018, the STATES Act was introduced in the Senate by Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. A companion bill was introduced in the House by Democratic representative Jared Polis of Colorado. The bill provides in relevant part that the provisions of the CSA, as applied to marijuana, “shall not apply to any person acting in compliance with state law relating to the manufacture, production, possession, distribution, dispensation, administration, or delivery of marihuana.” Even though marijuana will remain within Schedule I under the STATES Act, it makes the CSA unenforceable to the extent it is in conflict with state law. In essence, the bill extends the limitations afforded by the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer protection within the federal budget − which prevents the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Agency from using funds to enforce federal law against state-legal medical cannabis commercial activity − to both medical and recreational cannabis activity in all states where it has been legalized. By allowing continued prohibition to be a choice by the individual states, the STATES Act does not fully legalize cannabis on a national level. In that respect, the bill emphasizes states’ rights under the Tenth Amendment, which provides that “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no guarantee that the current presidential administration will treat the enforcement of marijuana regulations as low-priority enforcement of U.S. federal laws that conflict with state laws. Accordingly, there are a number of significant risks associated with the business of the Company and unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical and/or adult-use cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a significant risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and the business of the Company may be deemed to be producing, cultivating, extracting, or dispensing cannabis or aiding or abetting or otherwise engaging in a conspiracy to commit such acts in violation of federal law in the United States.

Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Access to Banking
 
Due to the CSA categorization of marijuana as a Schedule I drug, U.S. federal law makes it illegal for financial institutions that depend on the Federal Reserve’s money transfer system to take any proceeds from marijuana sales as deposits. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses under the United States Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”). Under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering or conspiracy.
 
While there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws to account for the trend towards legalizing medical and recreational marijuana by U.S. states, FinCEN has issued guidance advising prosecutors of money laundering and other financial crimes not to focus their enforcement efforts on banks and other financial institutions that serve marijuana-related businesses, so long as that business is legal in their state and none of the federal enforcement priorities are being violated (such as keeping marijuana away from children and out of the hands of organized crime). The FinCEN guidance also clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations, including thorough customer due diligence, but makes it clear that they are doing so at their own risk.
 
Due to the fear by financial institutions of being implicated in or prosecuted for money laundering, cannabis businesses are often forced into becoming “cash-only” businesses. As banks and other financial institutions in the U.S. are generally unwilling to risk a potential violation of federal law without guaranteed immunity from prosecution, most refuse to provide any kind of services to cannabis businesses. Despite the attempt by FinCEN to legitimize cannabis banking, in practice its guidance has not made banks much more willing to provide services to cannabis businesses. This is because, as described above, the current law does not guarantee banks immunity from prosecution, and it also requires banks and other financial institutions to undertake time-consuming and costly due diligence on each cannabis business they take on as a customer. Recently, some banks that have been servicing cannabis businesses have been closing accounts operated by cannabis businesses and are now refusing to open accounts for new cannabis businesses for the reasons enumerated above.
 
The few credit unions who have agreed to work with cannabis businesses are limiting those accounts to no more than 5% of their total deposits to avoid creating a liquidity risk. Since the federal government could change the banking laws as it relates to cannabis businesses at any time and without notice, these credit unions must keep sufficient cash on hand to be able to return the full value of all deposits from cannabis businesses in a single day, while also servicing the need of their other customers.
 
State Border Regulation
 
Another aspect of federal law is that it provides that cannabis and cannabis products may not be transported across state lines in the United States. As a result, all cannabis consumed in a state must be grown and produced in that same state. This dynamic could make it more difficult for the Company, in the short term, to maintain a balance between supply and demand. If excess cultivation and production capacity is created in any given state and this is not matched by increased demand in that state, then this could exert downward pressure on the retail price for the products the Company sells. If too many retail licenses are offered by state authorities in any given state, then this could result in increased competition and exert downward pressure on the retail price for the products the Company sells. On the other hand, if cultivation and production in a state fails to match demand then, in the short term, there could be insufficient supply of product in a state to meet demand and while the Company may be able to raise its prices there could be inadequate product availability in the short term, causing the Company’s revenue in that state to fall or to not grow to its full potential.
United States Border Entry
 
The United States Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, enforces the laws of the United States as they pertain to lawful travel and trade into and out of the U.S. Crossing the border while in violation of the CSA and other related United States federal laws may result in denied admission, seizures, fines, and apprehension. CBP officers administer determine the admissibility of travelers who are non-U.S. citizens into the United States pursuant to the United States Immigration and Nationality Act. An investment in our Subordinate Voting Shares, if it became known to CBP, could have an impact on a non-U.S. citizen’s admissibility into the United States and could lead to a lifetime ban on admission.
 
Because marijuana remains illegal under United States federal law, those investing in Canadian companies with operations in the United States cannabis industry could face detention, denial of entry, or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with United States marijuana businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of CBP officers on duty, and these officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a non-US citizen or foreign national. The government of Canada has started warning travelers that previous use of marijuana, or any substance prohibited by United States federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the marijuana industry in the United States could also be reason enough for CBP to deny entry. On September 21, 2018, CBP released a statement outlining its current position with respect to enforcement of the laws of the United States. It stated that Canada’s legalization of cannabis will not change CBP enforcement of United States laws regarding controlled substances and because marijuana continues to be a controlled substance under United States law, working in or facilitating the proliferation of the legal marijuana industry in U.S. states where it is deemed legal may affect admissibility to the United States. As a result, CBP has affirmed that, employees, directors, officers, managers and investors of companies involved in business activities related to marijuana in the United States who are not United States citizens, face the risk of being barred from entry into the United States.

Tax Concerns
 
An additional challenge to cannabis-related businesses is that the provisions of the Code, Section 280E, are being applied by the United States Internal Revenue Service to businesses operating in the medical and adult use cannabis industry. Section 280E of the Code prohibits cannabis businesses from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing them to pay higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a cannabis business depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, businesses in the legal cannabis industry may be less profitable than they would otherwise be.
 
Overall, the United States federal government has specifically reserved the right to enforce federal law in regards to the sale and disbursement of medical or adult-use marijuana even if such sale and disbursement is sanctioned by state law. Accordingly, there are a number of significant risks associated with the business of the Company and unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical and/or adult-use cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a significant risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and the business of the Company may be deemed to be producing, cultivating, extracting, or dispensing cannabis or aiding or abetting or otherwise engaging in a conspiracy to commit such acts in violation of federal law in the United States.

Disclosure that a license has been granted to or applied for by the Company does not imply that all required regulatory steps have been satisfied to operate a cannabis facility under that license, as licensing commonly requires multiple levels of approval at the state and local level, as well as securing compliant real estate, and licenses listed as having been granted are often provisional in nature.
 
The Company’s operations are in compliance with applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements. Additionally, the Company uses the same proprietary, best-practices policies and procedures in its managed dispensaries as in its owned dispensaries in order to ensure systematic operations and, as such, to the Company’s knowledge, the dispensaries that the Company manages are in compliance with applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements.
 
While the Company’s compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material violations of a license arising, there is no assurance that the Company’s licenses will be renewed in the future in a timely manner. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the licensing renewal process could impede the ongoing or planned operations of the Company and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
 
Nonetheless, for the reasons described above and the risks further described under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” herein, there are significant risks associated with the business of the Company. Readers are strongly encouraged to carefully read all the risk factors contained herein.

The following sections describe the legal and regulatory landscape in respect of the states in which the Company currently operates and as such in which it is currently contemplated that the Company will be operating upon completion of announced transactions.
 
In the United States, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. Although each state in which we operate (and anticipate operating) authorizes, as applicable, medical and/or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, and numerous other states have legalized marijuana in some form, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia remains illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts under U.S. federal law. Although we believe that our business activities are compliant with applicable state and local laws of the United States, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to marijuana may neither absolve us of liability under U.S. federal law, nor provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against us. Any such proceedings brought against us may result in a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Arizona
 
Arizona Regulatory Landscape
 
The Arizona Medical Marijuana Program (the “AZDHS Program”) is governed by Title 9; Chapter 17 Department of Health Services Medical Marijuana Program (the “AZDHS Rules”) and A.R.S. § 36-2801 et seq., as amended from time to time (the “Arizona Act”) (the AZDHS Rules and the Arizona Act collectively referred to herein as the “AMMA”). The Arizona Act, which was approved by the Arizona voters in 2010 provides the legal requirements and restrictions in conjunction with the applicable rules, guidelines and requirements, promulgated by the Arizona Department of Health Services (“AZDHS”). The AZDHS Program provides for a limited number of Medical Marijuana Dispensary Registration Certificates (each, an “Arizona License”). The program currently allows 131Arizona Licenses. A variety of product types are allowed in the state including medical marijuana and manufactured and derivative products which contain medical marijuana.
 
On November 3, 2020, Arizona voters enacted Proposition 207 which legalized adult-use cannabis for persons 21 years of age and older. The ADHS accepted applications for marijuana establishment licenses from early applicants, which are nonprofit medical marijuana licensed dispensaries or applicants in counties with less than two (2) nonprofit medical marijuana licensed dispensaries, from January 19, 2021 through March 9, 2021. Adult use sales began on January 19, 2021 immediately after the ADHS approved early adult use applications for existing nonprofit medical marijuana licensed dispensaries. As of August, 2021, the ADHS has approved total of 143 adult use establishment licenses. The Arizona Department of Health adopted regulations effective June 1, 2021, for the licensing of retailers, cultivators and manufacturers. The ADHS has stated that it plans to issue 26 marijuana establishment licenses to applicants who qualify under the Social Equity Ownership Program. The ADHS plans to accept applications for these licenses in December 2021 and random selection is planned to occur in the Spring of 2022. After issuing licenses to qualified early applicants and to the applicants who qualify under the Social Equity Ownership Program, the ADHS may not issue more than one marijuana establishment license for every ten (10) registered pharmacies in Arizona.
 
Licenses
 
Arizona state licenses are renewed biennially. There is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner along with the necessary supporting documents, and regulatory requirements are met, the licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.

Regulations
 
In the state of Arizona, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. A single license holder is provided with the ability to cultivate, harvest, process, transport, sell and dispense cannabis and cannabis products, and is not required to participate in all of the allowable activities. Delivery is allowed from dispensaries to patients only. Delivery to recreational customers is not allowed.
Reporting Requirements
 
The AZDHS has not selected a state mandated seed-to-sale system at this time. Licensed entities are permitted to choose their own provider or to track marijuana products from seed-to-sale using proprietary methods. The state however, tracks patient dispensing limits through a proprietary state system. Although there are no periodic reporting requirements to the state, full seed-to-sale tracking is required by all licensees and is periodically audited by the AZDHS. Additionally, all sales transactions are manually entered into the state dispensing tracking system at the time of transaction.
California
 
California Regulatory Landscape
 
In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients.
 
In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the “Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act” (“MCRSA”). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created multiple license types for dispensaries, infused products manufacturers, cultivation facilities, testing laboratories, transportation companies and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a state license and local approval to operate. However, in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the “Adult Use of Marijuana Act” (“AUMA”) creating an adult-use marijuana program for adult-use 21 years of age or older. AUMA had some conflicting provisions with MCRSA, so in June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”), which amalgamates MCRSA and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses in the state of California. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018. The three agencies that regulate marijuana at the state level are the California Department of Consumer Affairs’ Bureau of Cannabis Control (“BCC”), California Department of Food and Agriculture (“CDFA”), and California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”). The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration oversees.
 
On July 12, 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 141 (“AB-141”) into law in an effort to centralize and simplify regulatory and licensing oversight of the California cannabis market, thus creating the Department of Cannabis Control (“DCC”). With the passage of AB-141, the DCC consolidates three (3) state cannabis programs – BCC, CDFA, and the MCSB – under a single new department now known as the DCC. The law transfers all of the powers, duties, purposes, functions, responsibilities, and jurisdiction of the BCC, CDFA and CDPH to the DCC. Apart from creating the DCC, AB-141 also institutes many technical fixes and substantive changes to MAUCRSA and thus requires additional rulemaking at the DCC level, which will affect all licensees. Under AB-141, the deadline for the DCC to issue and renew provisional licenses is extended from January 1, 2022, to June 30, 2022. The DCC may issue a provisional license if the applicant has submitted a completed license application.
 
In order to legally operate a medical or adult-use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with marijuana licensing programs. Therefore, cities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to marijuana operators or can choose to outright ban marijuana.
 
Licenses
 
The Company is licensed to operate as a Medical and Adult-Use Retailer, Cultivator, Manufacturer and Distributor under applicable California and local jurisdictional law. The Company’s licenses permit it to possess, cultivate, manufacture, distribute, dispense and sell medical and adult-use cannabis in the state of California pursuant to the terms of the various licenses issued by the BCC, CDFA, and CDPH under the provision of the MAUCRSA and California Assembly Bill No. 133.

On August 27, 2020, MME Pasadena Retail, Inc. (“MME Pasadena”), a subsidiary of the Company, received a notice from the City of Pasadena that a determination was made that there had been a material change in ownership and/or management of MedMen such that the initial application was no longer valid, resulting in MME Pasadena losing the right to proceed through the cannabis permitting process in the City of Pasadena. On October 21, 2020, MME Pasadena filed a Writ of Mandate in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles against the City of Pasadena, followed by a First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate on December 8, 2020, seeking, among other things, an order requiring the city to revoke its denial of MME Pasadena’s application.
 
The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at the Company’s facilities in California. California state and local licenses are generally renewed annually. License renewal applications are submitted per guidelines published by local cannabis regulators, the DCC. While renewals are generally annual, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, the Company would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
 
Regulations
 
In the state of California, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. The Company has the capabilities to cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, distribute, and sell/dispense/deliver adult-use and medical cannabis and cannabis products. The state also allows the Company to make wholesale purchase of cannabis and cannabis products from, or a distribution of cannabis and cannabis product to, another licensed entity within the state.
Reporting Requirements
 
The state of California has selected Franwell Inc.’s METRC solution (“METRC”) as the state’s track-and-trace (“T&T”) system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the distribution chain (“seed-to- sale”). The METRC system is mandatory for all licensed operators in the state of California. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface (“API”).
 
Florida
 
Florida Regulatory Landscape
 
In 2014, the Florida legislature passed a low-THC cannabis law that allowed patients with a limited number of qualifying medical conditions to have access to low-THC cannabis and cannabis products. In 2015, five (5) vertically integrated dispensing organizations (“MMTCs”) were awarded licenses. In November of 2016, voters passed Amendment 2 (the “Amendment”), which expanded the array of qualifying medical conditions and gave patients access to full-strength medical cannabis. Late in the legislative session in 2017, the Florida legislature passed Senate Bill 8-A, which implemented the Amendment but restricted the original initiative by requiring vertical integration, limiting licenses at the state level, and prohibiting the sale and smoking of whole-plant cannabis flower (the “Rule”).
 
In March 2019, Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill amending the Rule to allow smoking of whole-plant cannabis flower. In August 2020, the Florida Department of Health’s Office of Medical Marijuana Use (“OMMU”) published emergency rules permitting the production, packaging, labeling, and dispensing of edible medical marijuana derivative products by MMTCs. MMTCs manufacturing edible medical marijuana derivative products must also comply with all requirements for food establishments in Chapter 500 of the Florida Statutes and any rules adopted by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (“FDACS”).
 
Litigation related to the 2015 applicants who were not selected for licensure and the Rule have been frequent and ongoing. In July 2019, the First District Court of Appeals (the “DCA”) issued an opinion in Department of Health v. Florigrown, ruling that two critical parts of the Rule are unconstitutional: (i) the requirement of vertical integration and (ii) the cap on the number of licenses allowed. The Florida Supreme Court heard argument on May 6, 2020, October 7, 2020, and on May 27, 2021, and rendered a 6-1 ruling on the matter holding the constitutional challenge to vertical integration and licensing caps is not likely to succeed on its merits and overturned the lower court’s injunction. The result of this case allows the Florida Department of Health’s Office of Medical Marijuana Use to move forward in creating and opening an MMTC application process guided by current rules and regulations. It is unknown at this time when the OMMU will again accept new applications.
 
All MMTCs currently operating are required to be vertically integrated, meaning each licensee is responsible for the entire cannabis supply chain: cultivation, processing, transporting and dispensing medical marijuana and low-THC cannabis products.
 
Recreational use is currently illegal in Florida, with the latest attempt, House Bill 343 and Senate Bill 710, having died in the Florida House and Senate, respectively, in April 2021.

Licenses
 
Florida state licenses are renewed biennially. Licensees are required to submit a renewal application and fees per guidelines published by OMMU. While renewals are biennial, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and regulatory requirements are met, the Company would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
Regulations
 
In the state of Florida, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. Florida is a “vertically-integrated” system, which gives a single license holder the ability to cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, transport, sell and dispense cannabis and cannabis products. In Florida, license holders must participate in all aspects of the value chain in order to dispense cannabis and cannabis products to patients. Delivery to patients is permitted under the license with approval from the OMMU.
Reporting Requirements
 
The OMMU has not selected a state mandated seed-to-sale system at this time. The state however, tracks patient dispensing limits through a proprietary state system. Although there are no periodic reporting requirements to the State, full seed-to-sale tracking is required by all licensees and is periodically audited by the OMMU. Additionally, all sales transactions are manually entered into the state dispensing tracking system at the time of transaction.
Illinois
 
Illinois Regulatory Landscape
 
In 2013, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act (410 ILCS 130), Public Act 98-0122 (the “Illinois Act”), which was signed into law by the Governor on August 1, 2013 and went into effect on January 1, 2014. The Illinois Act allows an individual who is diagnosed with a debilitating condition to register with the state to obtain cannabis for medical use. The program currently allows 60 Dispensing Organizations (each, a “DO”) and 22 cultivation centers statewide. A large variety of medical cannabis products are allowed in the state, including the smoking of cannabis flower. Overall, the program is administered by the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations (the “IDFPR”) is the regulatory agency overseeing the medical marijuana program for DOs and the Illinois Department of Agriculture is the regulatory agency overseeing the medical marijuana program for cultivation centers.
 
In June 2019, the Illinois governor signed legislation legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, legalizing and regulating marijuana for recreational use, went into effect on June 25, 2019, however recreational sales of marijuana began in the state on January 1, 2020. The adult use program allowed existing medical marijuana license holders to apply for Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization (“EAAUDO”) licenses to be able to sell adult use product at existing medical marijuana dispensaries (known as “co-located” or “same site” dispensaries) on January 1, 2020, and to have the privilege of opening a secondary adult use only retail site for every medical marijuana dispensary location the DO already had in its portfolio. All EAAUDO license holders were also required to commit to the state’s groundbreaking Social Equity program either through a financial contribution, grant agreement, donation, incubation program, or sponsorship program.
 
22

 

IDFPR will also be issuing an additional 75 Adult Use Dispensing Organization (“AUDO”) licenses in 2020. IDFPR is also expected to issue an additional 110 AUDO licenses by December 21, 2021. On September 3, 2021, the IDFPR announced the results from the Qualifying Applicant Lottery (conducted on July 29, 2021), the Social Equity Justice Involved Lottery (conducted on August 5, 2021), and the Tied Applicant Lottery (conducted on August 19, 2021) as the Department’s final administrative decision regarding applications for Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization Licenses (“Conditional Licenses”) under Sections 15-25 through 15-35.10 of the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act (“Act”). The Department also intends to issue at least 50 additional Conditional Licenses in 2022 under a new application process consistent with Section 15-35.20 of the Act.
 
On March 16, 2020, the IDFPR issued emergency regulations permitting the sale of medical cannabis and cannabis products outside of the dispensary as long as certain protective measures were in place. Adult-use cannabis sale process was unchanged. The permissible activity is currently extended through February 28, 2022.
 
Licenses
 
Licensees are required to submit an annual renewal application and fees per guidelines published by the IDFPR and the Department of Agriculture respectively. While renewals are annual, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and regulatory requirements are met, the licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
 
Under the adult use program, AUDO licenses are eligible for renewal every other year.
 
Regulations
 
In the state of Illinois, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. License holders are provided the ability to dispense cannabis and cultivation centers are provided with the ability to cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, and transport cannabis products. Delivery is not allowed from dispensaries to patients or consumers. Only designated caregivers may deliver medical cannabis to qualified patients.
Reporting Requirements
 
The state of Illinois has selected BioTrackTHC’s solution as the state’s track and trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale Licensed entities are permitted to choose their own provider to track marijuana products from seed-to-sale, provided that it has the ability integrate with BioTrackTHC via an API. License holders are required to provide IDFPR an annual financial report.
Massachusetts
 
Massachusetts Regulatory Landscape
 
The use of cannabis for medical use was legalized in Massachusetts by a voter approval of the Massachusetts Marijuana Initiative in 2012. The law took effect on January 1, 2013, eliminating criminal and civil penalties for the possession and use of up to a 60-day or ten-ounce supply of marijuana for medical use for patients possessing a state issued registration card.
 
On November 8, 2016, Massachusetts voters approved Question 4 or the Massachusetts Marijuana Legalization Initiative, which allowed for recreational or “adult use” cannabis in the Commonwealth. On September 12, 2017, the Cannabis Control Commission (“CCC”) was established under Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2017 (the “Massachusetts Act”) to implement and administer laws enabling access to medical and adult-use cannabis.
 
On November 16, 2018, the CCC issued the first notices for retail marijuana establishments to commence adult-use operations in Massachusetts.
 
Under the current program there are no statewide limits on the total number of licenses permitted however, no individual or entity shall be a controlling person over more than three licenses in a particular class of license. Similarly, no individual, corporation or other entity shall be in a position to control the decision making of more than three licenses in a particular class of license. In addition, all Marijuana Establishments are required to enter into host community agreements with the municipality in which they are located.
 
23

 

Licenses
 
Marijuana Establishment licenses are renewed annually. There is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, the applicable licensee provides an accounting of the financial benefits accruing to the municipality as the result of the host community agreement, and regulatory requirements are met, the licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
Regulations
 
In the state of Massachusetts, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. A Marijuana Retailer may purchase and transport marijuana products from Marijuana Establishments and transport, sell or otherwise transfer marijuana products to Marijuana Establishments. Delivery is permissible to medical patients only by medical marijuana license holders. A special license type was created in the under the recreational program that allows delivery to recreational customers. Licensed cultivators and product manufacturers may cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, package and sell marijuana products to Marijuana Establishments.
Reporting Requirements
 
The state of Massachusetts has selected METRC solution as the state’s T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. Licensed entities are permitted to choose their own provider to track marijuana products from seed-to-sale provided. The system allows for other third-party system integration via API.
Nevada
 
Nevada Regulatory Landscape
 
Medical marijuana use was legalized in Nevada by a ballot initiative in 2000. In November 2016, voters in Nevada passed an adult-use marijuana measure to allow for the sale of recreational marijuana in the state. The first dispensaries to sell adult-use marijuana began sales in July 2017. The Nevada Department of Taxation (“DOT”) is the regulatory agency overseeing the medical and adult use cannabis programs. Similar to California, cities and counties in Nevada are allowed to determine the number of local marijuana licenses they will issue.
 
On June 12, 2019, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak signed a new set of laws overhauling Nevada’s medical and recreational cannabis laws. These new laws created a new entity, the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (“CCB”), to take over the functions of bodies like the Nevada Department of Taxation’s Marijuana Enforcement Division. The CCB is modeled off the Nevada Gaming Control Board and began exercising its full powers on July 1, 2020. The CCB quickly gained a reputation for strict enforcement of license requirements, such as the timely payment of taxes and deadlines for the submission of renewal paperwork. Non-compliant licensees now face the shutoff of their access to METRC.
 
Moreover, the CCB requires that in addition to obtaining a Nevada license, each marijuana establishment must obtain a license and land use approval form from the local jurisdiction in which it is situated. A provisional or conditional licensee may not engage in cannabis business operations until it has received all necessary local approvals and a final registration certificate from the CCB. No single entity may own more than one license in a local jurisdiction or more than 10% of the allocable licenses in one local jurisdiction, whichever is greater.
 
The Company only operates in Nevada cities or counties with clearly defined marijuana programs. Currently, the Company is located in the City of Las Vegas, Clark County and Washoe County jurisdictions.
 
Licenses
 
Licenses are renewed annually and there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner along with the necessary supporting documents, and regulatory requirements are met, the licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
 
24

 

Regulations
 
In the state of Nevada, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. In Nevada, the Company has the capabilities to cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, and sell/dispense/deliver adult-use and medical cannabis and cannabis products. The state also allows the Company to make wholesale purchase of cannabis and cannabis products from another licensed entity within the state.
Reporting Requirements
 
The state of Nevada uses METRC as the state’s computerized T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. Individual licensees whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to provide data to the state to meet certain reporting requirements. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface.
New York
 
New York Regulatory Landscape
 
In July 2014, the New York Legislature and Governor enacted the Compassionate Care Act (A06357E, S07923) to provide a comprehensive, safe and effective medical marijuana program to meet the needs of New Yorkers. The program currently allows 10 Registered Organizations (each, an “RO”) to hold “vertically-integrated” licenses, which gives a license holder the ability to cultivate, harvest, process, manufacture, transport, sell and dispense cannabis and cannabis products. Limited product types are allowed in the state. The New York State Department of Health (the “NYSDOH”) is the regulatory agency overseeing the medical marijuana program.
 
On March 31, 2021, former Governor Cuomo signed legislation (S.854-A/A.1248-A) legalizing adult-use cannabis. The bill establishes the Office of Cannabis Management (the “OCM”) to implement and enforce a comprehensive regulatory framework that covers medical, adult-use and cannabinoid hemp. The OCM will be an independent office operating as part of the New York State Liquor Authority and will be governed by a five-member board, with three members appointed by the Governor and one appointment by each legislative house.
 
Concerning medical cannabis, the legislation will allow people with a larger list of medical conditions to access medical marijuana, increase the number of caregivers allowed per patient, and permit home cultivation of medical cannabis for patients.
 
Concerning adult-use cannabis, the legislation will create a two-tier licensing structure that will allow for a range of producers by separating those growers and processors from also owning retail stores. The legislation creates licenses for producers and distributors, among other entities, and the legislation will implement strict quality control, public health and consumer protections. The legislation also implements a new cannabis tax structure that will replace a weight-based tax with a tax per mg of THC at the distributor level with different rates depending on final product type. The wholesale excise tax will be moved to the retail level with a 9% state excise tax. The local excise tax rate will be 4% of the retail price. Counties will receive 25% of the local retail tax revenue, and 75% will go to the municipality. Cities, towns, and villages may opt-out of allowing adult-use cannabis retail dispensaries or on-site consumption licenses by passing a local law by December 31, 2021, or nine (9) months after the effective date of the legislation. They cannot opt-out of adult-use legalization.
 
Licenses
 
State licenses in New York are renewed biennially. Before the two-year period ends, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per guidelines published by the NYSDOH. While renewals are granted every two years, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, the licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
Regulations
 
In the state of New York, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. In New York, ROs are permitted to wholesale manufactured product and extracted cannabis. Delivery is allowed from dispensaries to patients with prior approval.
Reporting Requirements
 
The state of New York has selected BioTrackTHC’s solution as the state’s T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. The BioTrackTHC system is required to serve as all ROs’ patient verification system, but is optional as the RO facing tracking system. In addition to entering all dispensing transactions into the BioTrackTHC system, every month the NYSDOH requests a dispensing report in Excel format, via email, showing all products dispensed for the month.
Regulatory Affairs Program
 
The Company’s Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs oversees, maintains, and implements the compliance program and personnel. In addition to the Company’s robust legal and regulatory affairs departments, the Company also has local regulatory/compliance counsel engaged in the jurisdictions (state and local) in which it operates. Such counsel provides legal advice to the Company regarding compliance with state and local laws and regulations and the Company’s legal and compliance exposures under United States federal law. The Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs and Compliance Affairs Managers serve as liaisons to state and local regulators during both regular business hours and after hours. The Compliance Department, in partnership with the Retail, Human Resources, Legal, and Supply Chain Departments, is responsible for ensuring operations and employees strictly comply with applicable laws, regulations and licensing conditions and ensure that operations do not endanger the health, safety or welfare of the community. The Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs coordinates with the Security Department to ensure that the operation and all employees are following and complying with the Company’s written security procedures.
 
25

 

The Compliance Department oversees training for all employees, including on the following topics:
 

● | Compliance with State and Local Laws 
--+------------------------------------------
● | Safe Cannabis Use 
● | Dispensing Procedures 
● | Security & Safety Policies and Procedures
● | Inventory Control 
● | Track-and-Trace Training Session 
● | Transportation Procedures 

 
The Company’s compliance program emphasizes security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis and inventory from delivery by a licensed distributor to sale or disposal. Only authorized, properly trained employees are allowed to access the Company’s computerized seed-to-sale system.
 
The Company has created comprehensive standard operating procedures, operating plans, trackers and checklists that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory, as well as procedures for performing inventory reconciliation and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. The Company maintains accurate records of its inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to the Company’s standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that the Company’s operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements.
 
SERVICE PROVIDERS
 
As a result of any adverse change to the approach in enforcement of United States cannabis laws, adverse regulatory or political change, additional scrutiny by regulatory authorities, adverse change in public perception in respect of the consumption of marijuana or otherwise, third party service providers to the Company could suspend or withdraw their services, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, revenues, operating results, financial condition or prospects.
ABILITY TO ACCESS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAPITAL
 
The Company has historically had access to equity and debt financing from the public and private markets in Canada and private markets in the United States and internationally. While the company is not able to obtain bank financing in the U.S. or financing from other U.S. federally regulated entities, subject to market conditions, it has the ability to access to such equity and debt financing in Canada, the United States and internationally, both on a brokered and non- brokered basis. The Company’s executive team and the MedMen board have extensive relationships with sources of private capital (such as funds, high net worth individuals and family offices), which has facilitated its ability to complete non-brokered financing transactions.
 
If such equity and/or debt financing was no longer available in the public markets in Canada due to changes in applicable law or on terms which are acceptable, then the Company would endeavor to raise equity and/or debt financing privately. Commercial banks have approached the cannabis industry cautiously to date. However, there are increasing numbers of high net worth individuals, family offices, private equity and venture capital firms and other funds that have made meaningful investments in cannabis companies, including those with U.S. operations. Although there has been an increase in the amount of private financing available to cannabis companies over the last several years, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the Company when needed or on terms which are acceptable.
 
The Company’s inability to raise financing to fund operating or capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit its ability to operate or its growth and may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations or prospects.

COVID-19

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. While the ultimate severity of the outbreak and its impact on the economic environment is uncertain, the Company is monitoring this closely. The Company currently operates 23 store locations across California (12), Florida (6), Nevada (3), Illinois (1), and Arizona (1). The Company’s priority during the COVID-19 pandemic is protecting the safety of its employees and customers and it is following the recommended guidelines of applicable government and health authorities. Despite being deemed as an essential retailer in its core markets, the Company has experienced a negative impact on sales in certain markets as a result of shelter-at-home orders, social distancing efforts, restrictions on the maximum allowable number of people within a retail establishment and declining tourism. Although the Company only permanently closed one store as a result of COVID-19, certain markets, such as California and Nevada, experienced a greater impact on sales due to reduced store hours and foot traffic in certain locations, as well as limits on the number of customers that may be in a store at any one time. Other markets, such as Illinois and Florida have not been significantly impacted by COVID-19 and in some cases, stores in those markets have generated increased sales. Due to its strong vendor partnerships in each market, the Company has not experienced a significant impact to its supply chain in each market. In the event that the Company were to experience widespread transmission of the virus at one or more of the Company’s stores or other facilities, the Company could suffer reputational harm or other potential liability. Further, the Company’s business operations may be materially and adversely affected if a significant number of the Company’s employees are impacted by the virus.
 
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law. The CARES Act provides a substantial stimulus and assistance package intended to address the impact of COVID-19, including tax relief and government loans, grants and investments. The Company did not utilize any relief provided by the CARES Act and, as a cannabis retailer, the Company is not eligible to obtain a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act. The Paycheck Protection Program is governed by the rules of the Small Business Administration, which considers as ineligible for loans business concerns that are engaged in any illegal activity; the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis violates federal law in the United States. Accordingly, the CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 27, 2020.
 
During the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 27, 2020, the Company temporarily closed all three of its locations in Nevada for eight weeks due to a state-level mandate post-COVID-19. All three locations were open as of June 27, 2020. Furthermore, during the year ended June 27, 2020, the Company recognized impairments of long-lived assets and other assets totaling $239.5 million due to changes in anticipated revenue projections as a result of recent economic and market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and current regulatory environment.
 
For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, retail revenue was $40.7 million across the Company’s continuing operations in California, Nevada, Arizona, Illinois and Florida, representing a 20% increase, or $6.9 million, over the fiscal third quarter of 2021 of $33.8 million. The increase in retail revenue from continuing operations was driven primarily by increased consumer spending during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 wherein the number of COVID-19 cases nationwide declined and vaccines became available, allowing certain states to reopen and slowly lift restrictions.
 
While the Company continues to execute on its efforts to improve store profitability, reduce selling, general and administrative expense and delay capital-intensive projects, the Company is reassessing the timing of these cash flow milestones due to the potential impact of COVID-19 on its turnaround plan.
 
To date, the Company has generally implemented certain safety measures to ensure the safety of its customers and associates, which may have the effect of discouraging shopping or limiting the occupancy of our stores. Store operations in California and Nevada have been modified, with an increased focus on direct-to-consumer delivery and enabling a curbside pickup option for its customers. The Company leveraged its technology team to build the enhanced omni-channel functionality in, and expects to continue offering, a variety of purchasing options for its customers. These measures, and any additional measures that have been and may continue to be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have substantially decreased and may continue to decrease, the number of customers that visit our stores which has had, and will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ultimate magnitude of COVID-19, including the extent of its overall impact on our financial and operational results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time; however, the Company has experienced significant declines in sales. The overall impact will depend on the length of time that the pandemic continues, the extent to which it affects our ability to raise capital, and the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic, as well as uncertainty regarding all of the foregoing. At this time, it is unclear how long these measures may remain in place, what additional measures may be imposed, or when our operations will be restored to the levels that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
In addition, our business depends on consumer discretionary spending, and as such, our results are particularly sensitive to economic conditions and consumer confidence. COVID-19 has significantly impacted economic conditions, resulting in, among other things, unprecedented increases in the number of people seeking jobless benefits and a significant decline in global financial markets. As a result, even when all of our store locations are fully operational, there can be no guarantee that our revenue will return to its pre-COVID-19 levels.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
Turnaround and Growth Plan
 
Beginning in its fiscal third quarter 2019, the Company executed on a number of initiatives to restructure the business and reduce its operating expenses and cash burn:
Focus on Core Markets
 
Beginning in 2019, the Company began searching for opportunities to sell non-core assets to raise non-dilutive financing. The Company determined that the sale of non-core assets would allow for management to further focus on deepening its market share in its core markets. The Company previously intended to sell its assets in Arizona; however, following the passage and expeditious roll-out of adult-use sales in Arizona, the Company reclassified its Arizona operations from discontinued to continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Evanston, Illinois
 
On July 1, 2020, the Company executed definitive agreements, which were amended and restated on October 30, 2020, to sell all outstanding membership interests in MME Evanston Retail, LLC (the “Evanston Sale Agreement”), which owns the retail store located in Evanston, Illinois, for total consideration of $20.0 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company received $10.0 million of the total consideration. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company received $8.0 million of the total consideration, which, pursuant to the lender and landlord support agreements entered into during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, was used to paydown amounts outstanding under the Convertible Facility. The final payment of $2.0 million to be received in the form of a secured promissory note payable three months following the closing of the transaction. On August 10, 2020 (“Effective Date”), all operational control and risk of loss was transferred and the Company had no further obligation to fund operations of Evanston through a Consulting Agreement. Transfer of the cannabis license is pending regulatory approval as of the filing of the Form 10-K and the Company will take all commercially reasonable steps to maintain all permits for Evanston to operate its business.
New York - Investment Agreement
 
On February 25, 2021, MedMen NY, Inc. (“MMNY”), the New York subsidiary of the Company, and its parent, MM Enterprises USA, entered into an investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“AWH NY”), and Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“AWH”, and collectively, the “Investors”) whereby, subject to approval from the New York State Department of Health and other applicable regulatory bodies, AWH agreed to purchase shares of common stock of MMNY for an aggregate purchase price of up to $73.0 million as follows: (a) $35.0 million in cash to be invested in MMNY (as may be adjusted in accordance with the Investment Agreement), (b) AWH NY will issue a senior secured promissory note with a principal amount of $28.0 million, guaranteed by AWH, (c) and within five business days after the first sale by MMNY of adult use cannabis products at one or more of its retail store locations (the “Milestone”), AWH will purchase additional shares of MMNY for $10.0 million in cash, which cash investments and note will be used to reduce the amounts owed to the Company’s senior secured lender.
 
AWH also agreed to provide MMNY a working capital advance of $10.0 million, which may be increased up to $17.5 million, with no interest rate or prepayment penalty, which amount will be converted into shares of MMNY at the closing of the transaction. The terms of the advance include certain negative covenants, including restrictions on the assumption or incurrence of debts and liens, sale of assets, conducting mergers, declaring dividends, affiliated transactions outside the ordinary course of business or any fundamental change to equity interests or capital structure. Plus, certain events are considered events of default, which may result in the accelerated maturity of the amounts outstanding, a setoff of any obligation AWH may owe to MMNY or other remedies provided for in the related promissory note. These events of default include any failure to pay loan obligations, any failure to perform covenants required for in the agreement for the advance, any misstatement that is false or misleading made with respect to any representation or warranty or the insolvency of MMNY.
 
Following completion of the investment, AWH will hold a controlling interest in MMNY equal to at least 86.7% of the equity in MMNY. The Company also granted AWH the exclusive and irrevocable right to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of MMNY until the earlier of (i) ten years from the anniversary date and (ii) one year from the anniversary date that AWH is allowed by applicable law to purchase such shares.
 
In connection with the Investment Agreement, MMNY and AWH also entered into a management agreement (the “Management Agreement”) for a monthly fee of 35% of MMNY’s EBITDA pursuant to which AWH will advise on MMNY’s operations pending regulatory approval of the investment transaction. The Management Agreement is effective until December 31, 2021 and will automatically renew for an additional six months unless terminated earlier by MMNY or AWH.
 
Reduction in SG&A
 
On November 15, 2019, the Company announced plans to reduce corporate SG&A through a reduction in headcount, scaling back of marketing and technology spend and the renegotiation of ancillary costs to the business.
 
On May 27, 2020, the Company announced its fiscal third quarter 2020 financial results and reported corporate SG&A of $69.0 million on an annualized basis, representing 35% decrease from the previous quarter and 51% decrease from the prior year period. Through the end of fiscal third quarter 2020, the Company had reduced overall corporate SG&A by over $100.0 million on annualized basis since its cost-cutting efforts began in fiscal second year 2019.

Executive Management
 
During 2020, the Company began implementing changes to its executive management team, including the positions of Chief Executive Officer, and Board of Directors.
 
Effective February 1, 2020, Adam Bierman, who resigned as Chief Executive Officer in January 2020, and Andrew Modlin, who resigned as President and a director, agreed to surrender all of their respective Super Voting Shares to the Company. Mr. Bierman’s Super Voting Shares have been cancelled, and, as a result of the share cancellation, Mr. Bierman does not hold any Super Voting Shares nor any securities convertible or exchangeable into Super Voting Shares. In connection with his departure and surrender of his Super Voting Shares, the Company will compensate Mr. Bierman in the form of securities in an amount based on a third-party valuation, which provides an analysis and value of the Super Voting Shares as of February 1, 2020. In conducting the valuation the following factors were considered: the nature of the business and the history of the Company, the macroeconomic outlook, the condition and outlook of the Company’s specific industry, and its own circumstances at the time of the valuation, the book value of the stock and the financial condition of the business, the earning and paying capacity of the Company, whether or not the enterprise has goodwill or other intangible value, sales of the stock and the size of the block of stock to be valued, the market prices of stocks of corporations engaged in the same or a similar line of business having their stocks actively traded in a free and open market, either on an exchange or over-the-counter, and the market prices of similar shares conveying voting rights disproportionate to their economic share of the company. As of June 26, 2021, $475,650 was accrued in current liabilities for the amount owed to Adam Bierman related to the cancellation of his Super Voting Shares. The securities to be issued to Mr. Bierman will comprise of 50% Class B Subordinate Voting Shares and 50% restricted stock units of the Company and the number of securities to be issued will be based on the 20-day volume weighted average price of the Company’s Subordinate Shares on the date prior to issuance of the securities.
 
Mr. Modlin’s Super Voting Shares were automatically cancelled on December 10, 2020. As a result, Mr. Modlin does not hold any Super Voting Shares nor any securities convertible or exchangeable into Super Voting Shares. Based on the cancellation of the Super Voting Shares, the Company only has one class of outstanding shares, the Class B Subordinate Voting Shares.
 
In March 2020, the Company retained interim management and advisory firm, SierraConstellation Partners LLC (“SCP”), to support the company in the development and execution of its turnaround and restructuring plan. As part of the engagement, Tom Lynch was appointed as interim Chief Executive officer and Chief Restructuring Officer and Tim Bossidy, Director at SCP, was appointed as interim Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Lynch is a Partner and Senior Managing Director at SCP and previously served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Frederick’s of Hollywood Group, a publicly traded specialty retailer, and more recently Chief Executive Officer of David’s Bridal. Mr. Bossidy is a Director at SCP and previously served in interim management and financial advisory roles across the cannabis and consumer/retail sectors. In December 2020, Mr. Lynch was elected as Chairman of the Board and Reece Fulgham, a Managing Director at SCP, was appointed as interim Chief Financial Officer. In July 2021, Mr. Lynch was appointed as permanent Chief Executive Officer of the Company and, in connection with his appointment, the Company and SCP entered into a Transaction and Retention Bonus Agreement.
 
Lender and Landlord Support Agreement
 
On July 3, 2020, the Company announced the execution of definitive agreements (collectively referred to as the “Lender and Landlord Support Agreement”) with certain lenders, including Gotham Green Partners, Stable Road Capital and affiliates, and the landlord for several of its retail, cultivation and manufacturing facilities, Treehouse Real Estate Investment Trust. In the announcement, the Company noted that the Lender and Landlord Support Agreement would defer approximately $32 million of cash commitments over the next twelve months through a combination of cash interest and rent deferrals.
Senior Secured Convertible Note Facility
 
In April 2019, the Company entered into a senior secured convertible credit facility (the “Convertible Facility”) to provide up to $250.0 million in gross proceeds, arranged by Gotham Green Partners (“GGP”). The Convertible Facility is accessed through issuances by the Company to the lenders of convertible senior secured notes with an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 6.0% per annum (“Facility Notes”). In connection with the Convertible Facility, the Company has also issued share purchase warrants (the “Facility Warrants”) to purchase Subordinate Voting Shares. During fiscal years ended June 27, 2020 and June 26, 2021, the Convertible Facility was amended at various times modifying certain covenants, amending the conversion and exercise prices of securities issued pursuant to the Convertible Facility, cancelling and issuing new Facility Warrants and providing additional financing with the issuance of Facility Notes. As of June 26, 2021, there was outstanding $219.6 million of Facility Notes, including accrued interest, with a weighted average conversion price of approximately $0.24 per share and an aggregate of 208,102,561 Facility Warrants with a weighted average exercise price of $0.37 per share.

Second Restatement
 
On July 2, 2020, the Company amended and restated the Convertible Facility (the “Second Restatement”) wherein the minimum liquidity covenant was waived until September 30, 2020 and resetting at $5,000,000 thereafter with incremental increases on March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2021. The payment-in-kind feature on the Convertible Facility was also extended, such that 100% of the cash interest due prior to June 2021 will be paid-in-kind and 50% of the cash interest due thereafter will be paid-in-kind. The Second Restatement released certain assets from its collateral to allow greater flexibility to generate proceeds through the sale of non-core assets. The Second Restatement allowed for immediate prepayment of amounts under the Convertible Facility with a 5% prepayment penalty until 2nd anniversary of the Second Restatement and 3% prepayment penalty thereafter. As part of the Second Restatement, holders of Facility Notes were provided down-round protection where issuances of equity interests (including securities that are convertible or exchangeable for equity interests) by the Company at less than the higher of (i) lowest conversion price under the amended and restated notes of the Convertible Facility amendment dated March 27, 2020 and (ii) the highest conversion price determined for any incremental advances, will automatically adjust the conversion/exercise price of the previous tranches and incremental tranche 4 warrants and the related replacement warrants to the price of the newly issued equity interests. Certain issuances of equity interests were exempted such as issuances to existing lenders, equity interests in contemplation at the time of Second Restatement and equity interests issued to employees, consultants, directors, advisors or other third parties, in exchange for goods and services or compensation. As consideration for the amendment, the conversion price for 52% of the tranches 1 through 3 and the first amendment fee notes outstanding under the Convertible Facility were amended to $0.34 per share. An amendment fee of $2,000,000 was also paid through the issuance of additional notes at a conversion price of $0.28 per share.

In addition, 1,080,255 existing Facility Warrants were cancelled and replaced with 16,875,001 Facility Warrants with an exercise price of $0.20 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Facility, the conversion price for 5.0% of the existing Facility Notes outstanding prior to Tranche 4 and Incremental Advance (including paid-in-kind interest accrued on such Notes), being 5.0% of an aggregate principal amount of $170,729,923, was amended to $0.20 per share. As consideration for the additional advance, the Company also issued convertible notes as consideration for a $468,564 fee with a conversion price of $0.20 per share.
 
The Convertible Facility was also amended to include, among other things, a modification to the minimum liquidity covenant, which extends the period during which it is waived from September 30, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The minimum liquidity threshold resets to $5.0 million thereafter to $7.5 million effective on March 31, 2021 and then to $15.0 million effective on December 31, 2021.
 
On September 16, 2020 and September 28, 2020, the down round feature on the Facility Notes and Facility Warrants issued in connection with Tranche 4, Incremental Advances and certain amendment fees was triggered wherein the exercise price was adjusted to $0.17 and $0.15 per share, respectively.
 
Third Restatement
 
On January 11, 2021, the Company amended and restated the Convertible Facility (the “Third Restatement”) pursuant to which the Company received an additional advance of $10.0 million evidenced by the issuance of Facility Notes with a conversion price of $0.1608 per Subordinate Voting Share. In connection with the Third Restatement, the Company paid a fee of $937,127, which amount is also evidenced by the issuance of Facility Notes with a conversion price of $0.1608 per Share. The Company also issued 62,174,567 Facility Warrants exercisable for five years at a purchase price of $0.1608 per Share. The Facility Notes, and Facility Warrants issued pursuant to the Third Restatement included down round adjustment provisions, with certain exceptions, if the Company issued securities at a lower price.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Third Restatement, of the $168.1 million Facility Notes outstanding prior to Tranche 4 and the Incremental Advances thereunder (including paid-in-kind interest accrued on such notes), the conversion price of $47.1 million of the Facility Notes was changed to $0.17 per share ($16.8 million of which continued to be subject to down round adjustment provisions), and the Company cancelled an aggregate of 2,160,507 Facility Warrants that were issued with such notes and, in exchange, issued 41,967,832 Facility Warrants with an exercise price of $0.1608 per share.
 
At the time of the Third Restatement, the Convertible Facility included certain negative covenants, including restrictions on incurring liens and debt, sale of assets, conducting mergers, investments and affiliate transactions and making certain payments. The Convertible Facility was also amended to, among other things, modify the minimum liquidity covenant, which extended the period during which it was waived from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021, reset the minimum liquidity threshold to $7.5 million effective on July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, and $15.0 million thereafter, and waived of the minimum liquidity covenant if the Company is current on cash interest.

As a result of issuances of convertible debentures pursuant to the Company’s unsecured convertible debenture facility entered into on September 16, 2020, under the terms of the Convertible Facility (prior to the Third Restatement), the conversion prices of a total of approximately $63.9 million Facility Notes and the exercise prices of 130,804,447 Facility Warrants were reduced to $0.1529 per share.
 
On May 11, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement letter (the “Letter”) with GGP wherein the Company received reprieve from certain potential non-compliance with certain covenants under the Third Restatement dated January 11, 2021, such as potential non-compliance with certain reporting and notice requirements, pay certain liabilities when due, deliver control agreements for certain bank accounts, obtain consent from the lenders prior to hiring certain executives, obtain consent from the lenders for certain matters and related items. No amounts were paid by the Company for the Letter.
 
Fourth Restatement
 
On August 17, 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated Convertible Facility (“Fourth Restatement”) pursuant to which certain terms were amended, including among other things, extension of the maturity date of the Facility Notes to August 17, 2028, elimination of any cash interest payable and instead providing for paid-in-kind interest, elimination of certain repricing provisions that apply to the Facility Notes and the Facility Warrants, elimination of and revision to certain restrictive covenants and amendment to the minimum liquidity covenant. Accrued paid-in-kind interest will be convertible at the higher of (i) the per Share volume-weighted average price of the Shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (or, if not listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, such other recognized stock exchange or quotation system on which the Shares are listed for trading) for the period from the scheduled open of trading until the scheduled close of trading of the primary trading session over the 30 consecutive trading days prior to and including the relevant interest payment date, determined without regard to after-hours trading or any other trading outside of the regular trading session trading hours, and (ii) the price per share determined using the lowest discounted price available pursuant to the pricing policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange or otherwise permitted by the Canadian Securities Exchange. Following the Fourth Restatement, (i) the Facility Notes held by the holders on the effective date of the Fourth Restatement may not be prepaid without the prior written consent of the collateral agent until legalization of the general cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana at the federal level in the United States, or the removal of the regulation of such activities from the U.S. federal laws, following which any such prepayment shall require no less than six months’ notice from MedMen to the holders of such Facility Notes. The Convertible Facility continues to include affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on the following: incurring liens and debt, selling assets, conducting mergers, investments and affiliate transactions and making certain equity distributions, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. No changes were made to the conversion and exercise prices of the Facility Notes or Facility Warrants.
 
The Fourth Restatement also provides the holders of the Facility Notes with a top-up right upon the issuance by MedMen of certain Subordinate Voting Shares, or securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for Subordinate Voting Shares, in the form of warrants to acquire additional Subordinate Voting Shares, intended generally to maintain their “as converted” equity interest, and a pre-emptive right with respect to certain future equity financings of the Company, subject to certain exceptions.
 
An event of default may result in the accelerated maturity of all amounts outstanding under the Facility Notes and also an increase in the interest rate under the Convertible Facility by up to 3% per annum. An event of default includes but is not limited to failure to pay any amounts owed pursuant to the Convertible Facility, failure to comply with covenants, the filing of certain judgements and liens against the Company, filing of bankruptcy, prohibition by a governmental authority to conduct the Company’s material business or a material adverse change to business, loss of a cannabis license that results in a material adverse effect, default under any material agreement, a change of control, or de-listing for a securities stock exchange.
 
In connection with the Fourth Restatement, a newly formed limited partnership (the “Superhero LP”) established by Tilray, Inc. (“Tilray”) and other strategic investors, acquired an aggregate principal amount of approximately $165.8 million of the Facility Notes and 135,266,664 Facility Warrants, all of which were originally issued by MedMen and held by certain funds associated with GGP and certain other investors. The Company granted Tilray the right to appoint two non-voting observers to the Company’s board of directors.
 
On August 17, 2021, the Company also entered into Board Nomination Rights Agreements with each of S5 Holdings LLC (“S5 Holdings”) and GGP. With respect to S5 Holdings, so long as its diluted ownership percentage of MedMen (including the proportionate equity ownership of securities held by the Superhero LP) is at least 9%, S5 Holdings will be entitled to designate one individual to be nominated to serve as a director of the Company, which S5 Holdings has initially designated as Michael Serruya. With respect to GGP, so long as GGP and certain associated investors’ diluted ownership percentage of MedMen is at least 9%, GGP will be entitled to designate one individual to be nominated to serve as a director of the Company.

2018 Secured Term Loan 
 
In October 2018, MedMen Corp. completed a $77.7 million senior secured term loan (the “2018 Term Loan”) with funds managed by Hankey Capital, LLC and with an affiliate of Stable Road Capital (the “Term Loan Lenders”). The ownership interests of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the obligations under the 2018 Term Loan. Additionally, the Company guaranteed the obligations of MedMen Corp. under the 2018 Term Loan.
 
On January 13, 2020, the 2018 Term Loan was amended wherein the maturity date was extended to January 31, 2022 and the interest rate was increased to a fixed rate of 15.5% per annum, of which 12.0% will be payable monthly in cash based on the outstanding principal and 3.5% will accrue monthly to the principal amount of the debt as a payment-in-kind. The Company may prepay without penalty, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, the amounts outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan (on a non-revolving basis) upon 15 days’ notice. Certain ownership interests of the Company’s subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the obligations under the 2018 Term Loan. Additionally, the Company guaranteed the obligations of MedMen Corp. under the 2018 Term Loan.
 
MedMen Corp., a subsidiary of the Company, cancelled the existing warrants issued to the Term Loan Lenders, being 16,211,284 warrants exercisable for Class B Common Shares of MedMen Corp. (also called MedMen Corp. Redeemable Shares) at $4.97 per share and 1,023,256 warrants exercisable at $4.73 per share, and issued to the Term Loan Lenders a total of 40,455,729 warrants exercisable for MedMen Corp. Redeemable Shares with an exercise price of $0.60 per share that are exercisable until December 31, 2022. The new warrants issued to the Term Loan Lenders may be exercised at the election of their holders on a cashless basis.
 
On July 3, 2020, as part of the Lender and Landlord Support Agreement, the Company and the Term Loan Lenders further amended the commercial loan agreement that governs the 2018 Term Loan. Pursuant to the further amendment, 100% of the total interest payable prior to June 2021 will be paid-in-kind and 50% of the cash interest due thereafter for the remainder of the term of the 2018 Term Loan will be paid-in-kind. The PIK feature will expire if Section 280E tax reform occurs and the Company begins to be taxed similar to other U.S. corporations.
 
The threshold for the minimum liquidity covenant, which was previously $15.0 million, was waived until September 30, 2020, resetting to $5.0 million thereafter, to $7.5 million effective on March 31, 2021 and then to $15.0 million effective on December 31, 2021. In connection with the amendments to the 2018 Term Loan, the Company is now subject to certain additional covenants thereunder, which are consistent with those included as a part of the amendments to the Convertible Facility.
 
As consideration for the amendment of the 2018 Term Loan, MedMen Corp. issued to the lenders a total of 20.2 million warrants, each exercisable for MedMen Corp. Redeemable Shares at $0.34 per share for a period of five years. As additional consideration, a fee of $834,000 was paid-in-kind. The Company also canceled 20.2 million warrants of the total 40.4 million warrants already held by the Term Loan Lenders, which were each exercisable at $0.60 per share.
 
On September 16, 2020, the Company entered into a further amendment to the 2018 Term Loan. The amendments include, among other things, an increase in the potential size of the facility by $12,000,000, of which $5,700,000 (“Incremental Notes”) is fully committed by the Term Loan Lenders.
 
The principal amount of the Incremental Notes carry an interest rate of 18.0% per annum, to be paid as follows: (a) 12.0% shall be paid in cash monthly in arrears; and (b) 6.0% shall accrue monthly to the outstanding principal as payment-in-kind. The 2018 Term Loan was also amended to include, among other things, a modification to the minimum liquidity covenant, which extends the period during which it is waived from September 30, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The minimum liquidity threshold resets to $5.0 million thereafter to $7.5 million effective on March 31, 2021 and then to $15.0 million effective on December 31, 2021.
 
As consideration for the increase in the size of the facility under the 2018 Term Loan and the amendment to the covenant, MedMen Corp. issued warrants as follows: on the closing of the initial $3,000,000, MedMen Corp. issued to the Term Loan Lenders a total of 30,000,000 warrants, exercisable for MedMen Corp. Redeemable Shares at $0.20 per share for a period of five years and 20,227,865 warrants for MedMen Corp. Redeemable Shares exercisable at $0.34 per share for a period of five years; and on closing of the remaining $2,700,000 tranche, MedMen Corp. issued to the Term Loan Lenders an additional 27,000,000 warrants exercisable for MedMen Corp. Redeemable Shares at the greater of (a) $0.20 per share and (b) 115% multiplied by the volume-weighted average trading price of the shares for the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the applicable funding date of the second tranche. 
 
On September 16, 2020, the Company closed on a incremental term loan of $3,000,000 at an interest rate of 18.0% per annum of which 12.0% shall be paid in cash monthly in arrears; and 6.0% shall accrue monthly to the outstanding principal as payment-in-kind. In connection with the funding, MedMen Corp. issued 30,000,000 warrants each exercisable at $0.20 per share for a period of five years.
