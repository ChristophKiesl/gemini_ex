Item 1. Business
Overview



We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We were incorporated on August 11, 2020 as a Delaware corporation. We consummated an initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”) on October 19, 2020. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



The Company’s management team is led by James Travers, our Executive Chairman, and Michael Burdiek, our Chief Executive Officer. The Company’s sponsor is Motion Acquisition LLC (the “Sponsor”).



Initial Public Offering



On October 19, 2020 we consummated a $115,000,000 Initial Public Offering, consisting of 11,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (“Unit”). Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value (the “Class A common stock”) and one-third of one redeemable warrant (each, a “Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated a $3,800,000 private placement (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 2,533,333 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering except that, so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) they are not redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our Sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.



Prior to the Initial Public Offering, in August 2020, we issued an aggregate of 3,737,500 shares of our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Founder Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, to our Sponsor. In October 2020, our Sponsor contributed back to our capital an aggregate of 431,250 Founder Shares. Additionally, an aggregate of 431,250 Founder Shares were forfeited in November 2020 because the underwriter did not exercise its over-allotment option. As of December 31, 2020, the Sponsor owned 2,875,000 Founder Shares based on its proportional interest in the Company.



Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, $115,000,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement (including $4,025,000 of deferred underwriting commissions) was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). The Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, other than the withdrawal of interest to pay tax obligations, none of the funds held in the Trust Account will be released until the earliest of: (i) the completion of the initial business combination; or (ii) the redemption of any shares of Class A common stock included in the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Shares”) properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the initial business combination by October 19, 2022 (within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering); or (iii) the redemption of the Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial business combination by October 19, 2022, subject to applicable law. The proceeds held in the Trust Account can only be invested in permitted United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. As of December 31, 2020, we had a balance in cash and investments held in trust of $115,020,078. As of December 31, 2020, no funds had been withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay taxes. In March 2021, we paid our Delaware franchise tax liability for 2020 of $78,192, funded partially from the earnings on the Trust Account investments.



The remaining $3,825,000 held outside of Trust Account was used to pay underwriting commissions of $2,300,000, repay a loan from our Sponsor of approximately $71,000, and pay offering and formation costs. As of December 31, 2020, we had an unrestricted cash balance of $878,653 to satisfy our working capital needs.

Letter Agreement



In connection with our Initial Public Offering, our Sponsor, each member of our Board and each of our executive officers entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”). Pursuant to the Letter Agreement our Sponsor, directors and members of the management team have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if the Company does not complete a business combination by October 19, 2022, or to provide for redemption in connection with a business combination and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a business combination by October 19, 2022, although they will be entitled to redemption or liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame; (iv) vote any Founder Shares held by them and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of any proposed business combination for which we seek stockholder approval, (v) not to transfer or sell (subject to certain limited exceptions) (1) the Founder Shares until the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of our initial business combination or (B) subsequent to our initial business combination, (x) if the reported closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading-day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property, or (2) the private placement warrants and the Class A common stock underlying such warrants, until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.
Proposed Business Combination



On March 8, 2021, our board of directors unanimously approved an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated March 8, 2021 by and among the Company, Motion Merger Sub Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Ambulnz, Inc. (dba DocGo), a Delaware corporation (“DocGo”). If the Merger Agreement is adopted by our stockholders and the transactions under the Merger Agreement are consummated, Merger Sub will merge with and into DocGo (the “Merger”), with DocGo being the surviving entity of the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Proposed Transaction”). DocGo is a leading provider of last-mile telehealth and integrated medical mobility services with operations in 26 states in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom.



Unless otherwise indicated, the information in this Annual Report assumes we will not consummate the proposed business combination with DocGo, and that we will seek to find an alternative target with which to consummate an initial business combination.



Merger Agreement



Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, the outstanding DocGo common stock will be exchanged for a pro rata portion of an aggregate of 83,600,000 shares (“Closing Shares”) of our Class A common stock, less the number of Closing Shares reserved for issuance by the Company upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants of DocGo which will be assumed by the Company.



As part of the aggregate consideration payable to DocGo pursuant to the Merger Agreement, DocGo’s stockholders will also have the right to receive their pro rata portion of up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (“Contingent Shares”) if the following stock price conditions are met: (i) 1,250,000 Contingent Shares if the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) on any twenty (20) trading days in a thirty (30)-trading-day period at any time after the closing date and by the first anniversary of the closing date; (ii) 1,250,000 Contingent Shares if the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) on any twenty (20) trading days in a thirty (30)-trading-day period at any time after the closing date and by the third anniversary of the closing date; (iii) 1,250,000 Contingent Shares if the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) on any twenty (20) trading days in a thirty (30)-trading-day period at any time after the closing date and by the third anniversary of the closing date; and (iv) 1,250,000 Contingent Shares if the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $21.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) on any twenty (20) trading days in a thirty (30)-trading-day period at any time after the closing date and by the fifth anniversary of the closing date.





2







Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Sponsor will enter into an escrow agreement and will deposit an aggregate of 575,000 shares of Class A common stock (“Sponsor Earnout Shares”) into escrow, which shares will either be released to the Sponsor or forfeited if certain stock price conditions are met or not, as follows: (i) with respect to 287,500 Sponsor Earnout Shares, the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) on any twenty (20) trading days in a thirty (30)-trading-day period at any time after the closing date and by the third anniversary of the closing date, and (ii) with respect to the remaining 287,500 Sponsor Earnout Shares, the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) on any twenty (20) trading days in a thirty (30)-trading-day period at any time after the closing date and by the fifth anniversary of the closing date.



Consummation of the Proposed Transaction is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Merger Agreement, the Proposed Transaction and certain other actions related thereto by our stockholders and DocGo’s stockholders, the availability of at least $175,000,000 in cash from the Trust Account and from the proceeds of the PIPE (discussed below), after giving effect to redemptions, if any, by the Company’s public stockholders and other permitted disbursements, and DocGo having obtained certain regulatory approvals of the New York Department of Health with respect to the Proposed Transaction.



PIPE Private Placement



Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into subscription agreements with certain qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors (collectively, the “Investors”), pursuant to which the Company will, substantially concurrently with, and contingent upon, the consummation of the Merger, issue an aggregate of 12,500,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock to the Investors at a price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $125,000,000 (the “PIPE”).



The Company has agreed that, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 30 calendar days following the closing date of the Merger, it shall file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) covering the resale by the Investors of the Class A common stock issued to them in the PIPE and use its best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as promptly as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than the earlier of 60 calendar days after filing (or 90 calendar days in the event the SEC issues written comments) or the 10th business day after the Company is notified that the registration statement will not be subject to review or further review.



DocGo Support Agreements



Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company and holders of DocGo’s capital stock who hold at least a majority of DocGo’s Class A common stock and Series A preferred stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis, and holders of at least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of DocGo’s Series A preferred stock, voting as a separate class, entered into agreements (“Support Agreements”) pursuant to which they agreed to (i) appear at a stockholder meeting called by DocGo for the purpose of approving the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, for the purpose of establishing a quorum, (ii) execute a written consent in favor of the Merger, the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and waive certain preemptive rights as set forth in the Company’s charter documents, and (iii) not transfer, assign, or sell such covered shares, except to certain permitted transferees, prior to the consummation of the Merger.
Sponsor Waiver Agreement



Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, the Sponsor and DocGo entered into an agreement providing for the Sponsor’s waiver of the anti-dilution and conversion price adjustments set forth in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. As a result of such waiver, all outstanding Class B common stock of the Company will convert on a one-to-one basis into the Company’s Class A common stock concurrently with the closing of the Merger Agreement.
Registration Rights Agreement



The Merger Agreement provides that, concurrently with the closing of the Merger, the Company will amend and restate its existing registration rights agreement (as amended and restated, the “A&R Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company will agree to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), after the lapse or expiration of any transfer restrictions, lock-up, or escrow provisions which may apply, the shares of the Company’s common stock held by persons who are or will be affiliates of the Company after the completion of the Merger (including shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of warrants or other convertible securities of the Company).

Completing Our Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to consummate our initial business combination using cash held in the Trust Account, the proceeds from one or more private financings, and our equity as the consideration. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may consummate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by public stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements. Neither our Sponsor nor any of our officers, directors or stockholders are required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination.



Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination



Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commission and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as a discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test.





4







To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent ownership, management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete an alternative business combination.



Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly tender their shares for redemption will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission we will pay to the underwriter. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into the Letter Agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules. We currently intend to hold a stockholder meeting to approve the Proposed Transaction.



The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares by one of the two methods listed above is contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon.



If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, as we plan to do in connection with the Proposed Transaction, we will:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------






5







If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will:




● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Submission of our Initial Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote



If we seek stockholder approval, as we currently intend to do for the Proposed Transaction, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our Sponsor will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after our Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our Sponsor’s Founder Shares, we would need only 4,312,501, or 37.5%, of the 11,500,000 Public Shares sold in our Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreement of our Sponsor, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the initial business combination, or at all, or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the initial business combination.



Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, as we currently intend to do in connection with the Proposed Transaction, and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem more than 15% of the shares sold in our Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we will not restrict our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have until October 19, 2022 (24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering) to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 24-month time period.

Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.



In recent years, and especially since the fourth quarter of 2020, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination.



If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.



Facilities



Our executive offices are located at c/o Graubard Miller, The Chrysler Building, 405 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10174 and our telephone number is (212) 818-8800. Our office space, to the extent it is needed, is being provided to us for no charge by Graubard Miller, our counsel. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers and directors, adequate for our current operations.
Employees



We currently have four officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Available Information



We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov.
Risk Factors Summary



An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainties. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to:

● | We are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






7








● | Our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, and even if we held a vote, holders of our Founder Shares will participate in such vote, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our Sponsor and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your redemption rights, unless we seek stockholder approval of the initial business combination. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into an initial business combination with a target. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.

● | The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our Initial Public Offering may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may decrease the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders.

● | Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the status of debt and equity markets.

● | We may not be able to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our Initial Public Offering, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our Public Shares and liquidate, in which case our public stockholders may receive only $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless.

● | If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase Public Shares or warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed initial business combination and reduce the public “float” of our Class A common stock or Public Warrants. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Since our Sponsor, officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.

● | If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our Public Shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for submitting or tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.

● | If the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants not being held in the Trust Account are insufficient to allow us to operate for the 24 months after the closing of our Initial Public Offering, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our ability to complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsors, their affiliates or members of our management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination.

● | If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a “group” of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our Class A common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our Class A common stock.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, which we currently expect to do, the risk factors related to the proposed business combination will be set forth in a Proxy Statement/Prospectus which will be filed with the SEC and distributed to stockholders in advance of the stockholders meeting at which approval is sought.
