ITEM 1. Business
(a) General Background
We are a diversified services and supply chain management company that assists our clients in sustaining, extending the service life, and improving the performance of their transportation, equipment, and other assets and systems. We provide logistics and distribution services for legacy systems and equipment and professional and technical services to the United States Government (the "government"), including the United States Department of Defense ("DoD"), the United States Postal Service ("USPS"), federal civilian agencies, and commercial and other customers. Our largest customers are the DoD and the USPS. Our operations include supply chain management solutions, parts supply and distribution, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (“MRO”) services for vehicle fleet, aviation, and other clients; vehicle and equipment maintenance and refurbishment; logistics; engineering; energy and environmental services; IT and health care IT solutions; and consulting services.
VSE was incorporated in Delaware in 1959 and the parent company serves as a centralized managing and consolidating entity for our operating groups, each of which consists of one or more subsidiaries (all of which are wholly owned) or unincorporated divisions that perform our services. VSE’s operating groups include our Supply Chain Management Group, Aviation Group, Federal Services Group, and IT, Energy and Management Consulting Group. The term "VSE" or "Company" means VSE and its subsidiaries and divisions unless the context indicates operations of only VSE as the parent company.
(b) Financial Information
Our operations are conducted within four reportable segments aligned with our operating groups: (1) Supply Chain Management, which generated 29.7% of our revenues in 2016; (2) Aviation, which generated 19.3% of our revenues in 2016; (3) Federal Services, which generated approximately 44.2% of our revenues in 2016; and (4) IT, Energy and Management Consulting, which generated 6.8% of our revenues in 2016. Additional financial information for our reportable segments appears in Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.

Revenues and Contracts 
Our revenues are derived from the delivery of products and from contract services performed for our clients. We offer our products and professional and technical services through various ordering agreements and negotiated and competitive contract arrangements.
Our Supply Chain Management Group revenues result from the sale of vehicle parts to the USPS and other government and commercial clients. We recognize revenue from the sale of vehicle parts when the customer takes ownership of the parts.

Our Aviation Group revenues result from the sale of aircraft parts and performance of MRO services for private and commercial aircraft owners, other aviation MRO providers, and aviation original equipment manufacturers. We recognize revenues upon the shipment or delivery of products to customers based on when title or risk of loss transfers to the customer.
Our Federal Services and IT, Energy and Management Consulting Group revenues result primarily from cost plus fixed fee, cost plus award fee, time and materials, or fixed-price contracts with the government. Revenues result from work performed on these contracts by our own employees, from work performed by our subcontractors, and from costs of materials used in performing the work. Revenues on cost‑type contracts are recorded as allowable costs are incurred and fees are earned. Revenues for time and materials contracts are recorded on the basis of allowable labor hours worked multiplied by the contract defined billing rates, plus the cost of materials used in performance on the contract. Profits or losses on time and material contracts result from the difference between the cost of services performed and the contract defined billing rates for these services. Revenue recognition methods on fixed-price contracts vary depending on the nature of the work and the contract terms. Revenues on fixed-price service contracts are recorded as work is performed, typically ratably over the service period. Revenues on fixed-price contracts that require delivery of specific items are recorded based on a price per unit as units are delivered.
The USPS, U.S. Army, and U.S. Navy are our largest customers. Our customers also include various other government and commercial entities.

Backlog 
Funded backlog represents a measure of potential future revenues from work performed by our Federal Services and IT, Energy and Management Consulting groups on government contracts. Funded backlog is defined by us as the total value of contracts that has been appropriated and funded by the procuring agencies, less the amount of revenues that have already been recognized on such contracts. Our reported backlog is comprised of funding received by us in incremental amounts for work that is generally expected to be completed within six to 12 months following the award of the funding. Our funded backlog for our Federal Services and IT, Energy and Management Consulting groups as of December 31, 2016, was approximately $322 million and as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 it was approximately $238 million and $193 million, respectively. Changes in funded backlog on contracts are sometimes unpredictable due to uncertainties associated with changing government program priorities and availability of funds, which is heavily dependent upon the congressional authorization and appropriation process. Delays in this process may temporarily diminish the availability of funds for ongoing and planned work.
In addition to funded backlog levels, we have contract ceiling amounts available for use on multiple award, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts with DoD and federal civilian agencies. While these contracts increase the opportunities

available for us to pursue future work, the actual amount of future work is indeterminate until task orders are placed on the contracts. Frequently, these task orders are competitively awarded. Additionally, these task orders must be funded by the procuring agencies before we can perform work and begin generating revenues. 
Marketing 
Our marketing activities are conducted at the operating group level by our marketing and business development staff and our professional staff of sales representatives, managers, and other personnel. New customer contacts and information concerning new programs, requirements and opportunities become available through attendance at industry trade shows and events, through sales calls and client servicing, through negotiation with key business partners, through formal and informal briefings, from participation in professional organizations, in the course of contract performance, and from literature published by government, trade associations, professional organizations and commercial entities.
Personnel 
Our employees have a variety of specialized experience, training, and skills that provide the expertise required to service our clients. Some have high levels of education. As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,523 employees, an increase from 2,057 as of December 31, 2015. Principal employee categories include (a) mechanics and vehicle, aircraft, and equipment technicians, (b) logisticians, (c) warehouse and sales personnel, (d) engineers and technicians in mechanical, electronic, industrial, energy and environmental services, and (e) information technology professionals in computer systems, applications and products, configuration, change and data management disciplines. The expertise required by our customers frequently includes knowledge of government regulations and procedures. 
We actively seek initiatives and participate in outreach programs to assist individuals who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. These efforts include an emphasis on hiring military veterans, which we believe enhances the quality of our workforce. Approximately 30% of our employees have previously served as members in the U.S. Armed Forces.
Competition 
The supply chain, logistics, and MRO services offered by our Supply Chain Management and Aviation groups and the federally contracted professional and technical services offered by our Federal Services and IT, Energy and Management Consulting groups are conducted in very competitive operating environments. 
The vehicle parts aftermarket and aviation parts and servicing markets are fragmented, with many large and small competitors that compete for our customer base. 
Large diversified federal contracting firms with greater financial resources and larger technical staffs are capable of providing the same services offered by us. Government agencies emphasize awarding contracts on a competitive basis as opposed to a sole source or other noncompetitive basis. Most of the significant contracts under which we currently perform services were either initially awarded on a competitive basis or have been renewed at least once on a competitive basis. There is no assurance regarding the level of work we may obtain under some of these contracts. Government budgets, and in particular the budgets of certain government agencies, can also affect competition in our business. A general decline in government budgets, a reallocation of government spending priorities, or a reallocation of work for small business set-aside programs that results in lower levels of potential business in the markets we serve or the services we offer will cause increased competition.
The extent of competition that we will encounter as a result of changing economic or competitive conditions, customer requirements or technological developments is unpredictable. We believe the principal competitive factors for our business are customer knowledge, technical and financial qualifications, past performance, government budgetary stress, and price, which has been more heavily weighted in recent years.
