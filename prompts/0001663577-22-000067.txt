Item 1. Business
 
Organization and Description of Business
 
 Cannagistics, Inc. (Formerly FIGO Ventures, Inc., formerly Precious Investments, Inc.) (‘The Company’) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 26, 2004. The Company was an Exploration Stage Company with the principal business being the acquisition and exploration of resource properties.
 
The Company had allowed its charter with the state of Nevada to be revoked by the Secretary of State for failure to file the required annual lists and pay the required annual fees. Its last known officers and directors reflected in the records of the Secretary of State were unresponsive or stated they were no longer involved with the Company. The purported replacement officers and directors were unresponsive.
 
On September 14, 2012, NPNC Management, LLC filed a petition in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada and was appointed custodian of the Company on January 15, 2012.
 
On October 24, 2012, the interim board authorized the sale of 55,000,000 (2,200,000 split adjusted) shares of common stock for $6,000 to NPNC Management, LLC, in a private placement transaction exempt from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to section 4(2) thereof and the rules and regulations promulgated there under.
 
On March 1, 2017, the Company then entered into a joint venture agreement with Eddeb Management (“Eddeb”). The purpose of the joint venture is to build a fund for the purpose of trading in precious gems, notably, colored diamonds.
 
 On November 16, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with American Freight Xchange, Inc., a privately held New York corporation (“American Freight”), and Shipzooka Acquisition Corp. (“Shipzooka Sub”), a newly formed wholly owned Nevada subsidiary of Precious Investments, Inc. In connection with the closing of this merger transaction, Shipzooka Sub merged with and into American Freight (the “Merger”) on December 5, 2017, with the filing of Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State and Certificate of Merger with the New York Division of Corporations.
 
The transaction resulted in the Company acquiring Subsidiary by the exchange of all of the outstanding shares of Subsidiary for 1,000,000 newly issued Series C Preferred shares of stock, $0.001 par value (the “Preferred Stock”) of Parent which have conversion and voting rights of 72.5 votes for each share, representing approximately 90.2% of the voting rights.
 
For accounting purposes, the transaction was treated as a reverse merger since the acquired entity now forms the basis for operations and the transaction resulted in a change in control, with the acquired company electing to become the successor issuer for reporting purposes. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared to reflect the assets, liabilities and operations of American Freight Xchange, Inc. exclusive of Precious Investments, Inc since all predecessor operations were discontinued.
 
As part of the transaction, amounts due to former officers were forgiven, with the balances recorded as Contributed Capital. For equity purposes, accumulated deficit shown are those American Freight Xchange, Inc. Shipzooka Acquisition Corp. is a dormant corporation.
 
On July 23, 2018, the Company amended the name of its subsidiary, KRG Logistics, Inc., to Global3pl, Inc. (an Ontario corporation).
 
On September 4, 2018, the Company incorporated Cannagistics, Inc., in the province of Ontario, Canada. This is intended to be a possible new line of business for the Company but is dormant at this time.
 
On April 17, 2019, we filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of Nevada in order to effectuate a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary, Cannagistics, Inc. Shareholder approval was not required under Section 92A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. As part of the merger, our board of directors authorized a change in our name to “Cannagistics, Inc.” and our Articles of Incorporation have been amended to reflect this name change.

On September 26, 2019, the Board of Directors approved the registered spinout of its Global3pl, Inc., (a New York corporation) (“Global3pl”) subsidiary. Global3pl is to be a logistics technology provider, along with the American Freight Xchange and UrbanX Platforms that have been under development by the Company.
 
The Board of Directors also declared a stock dividend for all shareholders, with a record date of October 10, 2019. For every 50 shares of common stock of the Company, all shareholders of record on the record date will receive one share of common stock in Global3pl. Global3pl will also file a registration statement as part of its raise of capital to complete the development of American Freight Xchange, a North American freight broker-driven 3pl network to handle the management of long haul LTL (less than truckload), and specialty freight (white glove) services and Urbanx, a North American network of rush-messenger local trucking services for forward and reverse last mile delivery (including white glove service).
 
However, the Company has carefully reconsidered its position with respect to the previously announced and subsequently amended spin off of Global3pl, Inc., (a New York corporation). Due to the current situation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and especially in light of the development of the supply chain management strategy of the Company, it has been determined that the finalization of the development of the Global3pl platform will be integral and serve as the “engine” for the supply chain management of the Company. Therefore, at this time the “spin-off” has been indefinitely postponed until such time and it may make sense from a business standpoint. The Company has not issued any shares in the Global3pl, Inc (New York) subsidiary.
 
Effective October 1, 2019, the Company suspended operations of its subsidiary Global3pl, Inc., formerly known as KRG Logistics, Inc., (an Ontario corporation), suspended future operations related to the operations in Mississauga, Ontario. It is in the process of collecting accounts receivables still due and working on a plan to pay its payables. It has entered into an agreement with 10451029 Canada Inc., d/b/a Reliable Logistics, for the assignment and of the assets of Global3pl, Inc., (an Ontario Corporation). The transaction was completed on November 6, 2019. The Company anticipates formally liquidating and dissolving the subsidiary in the next fiscal Quarter. This is a separate corporation from Global3pl, Inc. (A New York corporation).
 
On May 6, 2021, the issuer (having been renamed, immediately prior to this Holding Company Reorganization, from “Cannagistics, Inc.” to “Global Transition Corporation”) completed a corporate reorganization (the “Holding Company Reorganization”) pursuant to which Global Transition Corporation, as previously constituted (the “Predecessor”) merged with a company which became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of a newly formed Delaware Corporation, Cannagistics, Inc. (in this capacity referred to as the “Holding Company”), which became the successor issuer. In other words, the Holding Company is now the public entity, albeit with the same name as the original issue or the Predecessor. The Holding Company Reorganization was effected by a merger conducted pursuant to Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), which provides for the formation of a holding company without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporations (such constituent corporations being the Predecessor, as renamed to Global Transition Corporation and the newly formed Cannagistics, Inc.).
 
In accordance with the DGCL, Global3pl, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), another newly formed Delaware Corporation and, prior to the Holding Company Reorganization, was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company, merged with and into the Predecessor, with Merger Sub surviving the merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company (the “Merger”). The Merger was completed pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger among the Predecessor, the Holding Company and Merger Sub, dated May 6, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”).
 
As of the effective time of the Merger and in connection with the Holding Company Reorganization, all outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock of the Predecessor were automatically converted into identical shares of common stock or preferred stock, as applicable, of the Holding Company on a one-for-one basis, and the Predecessor’s existing stockholders and other holders of equity instruments, became stockholders and holders of equity instruments, as applicable, of the Holding Company in the same amounts and percentages as they were in the Predecessor immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization.
 
The executive officers and board of directors of the Holding Company are the same as those of the Predecessor in effect immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization.

-

For purposes of Rule 12g-3(a), the Holding Company is the successor issuer to the Predecessor, now as the sole shareholder of the Predecessor. Accordingly, upon consummation of the Merger, the Holding Company’s common stock was deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder.
 
The previously executed Letter of Intent with Recommerce Group, Inc. has expired, although the Company has continued discussions with Recommerce Group, Inc. about a potential business combination.
 
On July 1, 2021, we entered into a Reorganization and Stock Purchase Agreement with Availa Bio, Inc. and Cannaworx Holdings, Inc. (now known as “The Integrity Wellness Group, Inc.” hereinafter “Integrity Wellness”) pursuant to which we acquired Integrity Wellness in exchange for 4,400,000 shares of the Company’s Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. We also changed our state of incorporation to Delaware. A significant majority of our operations are now operated through Integrity Wellness which because of the transaction became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. We expect to change our name to The Integrity Wellness Group, Inc. subject to regulatory compliance.
 
Following our acquisition of Integrity Wellness, we shifted to our current business plan and focus which is the development, marketing and sale of OTC, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic and health and wellness products with a focus on products infused with phytocannabinnoid, which we refer to as “CBD.” We now have a portfolio of products designed for the treatment of ailments and symptoms and/or general improvement of health and wellbeing by topical or oral administration. These product offerings, which are described more fully below, are designed to provide a variety of treatments, benefits and uses including pain relief, anti-aging, hygiene, energy, and immune system and biochemical support. We also have products designed for veterinary and agricultural uses. We have six patents and 15 patent applications pending for our products, as well as a number of trademarks. Our mission is to alleviate suffering and adverse consequences caused by certain health and biological conditions and enhance users’ quality of life.
 
On September 15, 2021, the Company filed a Def14C Information Statement. The Def14C Information Statement set out the plan of the Company to amend its name to The Integrity Wellness Group, Inc., or some other similar name, and to effectuate a reverse stock split of its common stock of one (1) new share of common stock for each forty (40) old shares of common stock. The Company is in the process of filing with FINRA to make these changes effective.

Research & Development and Product Manufacturing
 
Our products are produced using third party manufacturers who are responsible for sourcing the raw materials and ingredients and adhering to applicable specifications and regulatory requirements including the FDA’s good manufacturing practices (GMP) certification. We also use some of these same third parties for research and development and testing functions as and when the need arises. We rely on a limited number of these manufacturers to develop and produce our product offerings.

-

The availability and production capability of our manufacturers depends on the raw material supplies and sources, as well as other projects on which our manufacturers may be engaged at a given time. Because of these contingencies, the lead times on production and delivery schedules can fluctuate, which may cause us to fail to meet internal or contractual deadlines. As we grow, we hope to be able to accurately forecast and manage these processes to try and ensure we have adequate inventory on hand to meet demand. A primary raw material utilized in the production process for our products is CBD isolate which can only be produced in certain states. While we believe there are sufficient sources for CBD isolate and other raw materials necessary to meet our production needs, shortages and delays can occur, which could harm us by prolonging or suspending expected deliveries or increasing production costs.
 
COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity which is likely to continue to reduce the future demand for a broad variety of goods and services, while also disrupting sales channels, marketing activities and supply chains for an unknown period of time until the virus is fully contained. Supply chain disruptions have been increasingly common since the pandemic began, and such disruptions may affect us in the future.
 
Sales and Distribution
 
Our products will be sold both online on our website, and through wholesale and retail establishments including both brick and mortar stores and ecommerce platforms. We also intend to sell our products in part using a direct selling model in which we contract with independent contractors who are compensated by commissions from their sales of our products. We intend to dedicate substantial capital, including a portion of the proceeds from this offering, to build a sales force consisting of a combination of employees of the Company and independent contractors.
Planned Operations and Products Under Development
 
New and Planned Products
 
In addition to our developed products, we are also in the process of evaluating and developing new products. Our ability to develop and launch these products within the timeframes intended or at all depends in large part on the Company receiving sufficient proceeds. If we are unable to raise at least $ 2,500,000 the development, production and distribution of these products may be delayed or discontinued. Even with the required capital, planned or future projects may not come to fruition. Below is a brief summary of the projects which are planned and/or under development.
Partnership with Medizone Bio
 
We, through Integrity Wellness, have entered into a Partnership Agreement with Medizone Bio, Inc., (“Medizone Bio”) which provides for a 50/50 partnership for the production of biodegradable face masks, and medical supplies, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 testing materials. Under the Partnership Agreement, Integrity Wellness is to provide an initial funding of $300,000 in financing for Medizone Bio to manufacture the first Medizone Bio products purchase order. This purchase order has a value of $1,200,000. Integrity Wellness has borrowed $300,000 from and issued a promissory note to a third party which is affiliated with Dr. Babak Ghalili, a director of the Company, for the purpose of funding the purchase order. See “Related Party Transactions.” Integrity Wellness will provide the partnership with financing, marketing, sales distribution in wholesale, retail and direct-to-consumer (e.g., QVC, HSN, Amazon, etc.), financing for general working capital and purchase order financing, while Medizone Bio provides the partnership with a series of purchase orders. The net profits, if any, will be distributed between the partners in equal proportions.
Exosome Product Research and Development
 
We are in the early stages of developing a new business which will focus on a new line of products using naturally occurring nanosized compounds (approximately 30-150 nanometers in diameter), referred to as “exosomes,” which are derived from stem cells and cause growth and regeneration by acting as biologic messengers at the cellular level of the human body. Exosomes work by delivering chemical signals to the cells they permeate, instigating the production of regenerative proteins and other compounds while also inhibiting destructive inflammatory cytokines. We intend to explore the potential use of exosome science to develop products designed to serve regenerative and health and wellness functions such as hair and skin regeneration. However, we are still in the very early development of this project, and no assurances can be given that we will be able to proceed with our planned exosome product operations as intended or at all. We do not expect to own or acquire intellectual property rights or participate directly in the development and manufacturing efforts for exosome products, and instead intend to license the intellectual property rights of third parties in order to market and sell the finished products.
SaaS Logistics Platform
 
Prior to the acquisition of Integrity Wellness, we were in the process of developing a SaaS platform intended to enable users to monitor and manage numerous aspects of the supply chain as they obtain raw materials, develop and produce products, and bring their products to the marketplace. The intended focus of the platform and services was on OTC, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, nutraceutical, hemp/CBD and health and wellness products. The development efforts to date have been conducted primarily by Corengine, Inc., a third-party software development company. However, we have yet to develop and commercialize the platform, which has been delayed in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The platform’s intended function is to assist users with the tracking, monitoring and management of their respective manufacturing and distribution processes. The SaaS-based platform will be designed to fully integrate the various components of the supply chain, from obtaining raw materials through product manufacturing and distribution and inventory and shelf-life batch tracking. We had previously announced the spin-off of the business which was subsequently suspended indefinitely due to COVID-19.
