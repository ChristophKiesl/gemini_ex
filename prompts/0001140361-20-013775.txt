Software as a Service: In this model, etailz provides partners access to software through its platform of proprietary technology to empower partners to self-manage their marketplace channel. etailz charges a subscription fee and receives a percentage of the transaction.
 
By offering a platform of software and services, etailz intends to diversify its risk and leverage its assets to capture more market share.

Technology and Integrations
 etailz’s marketplace growth platform of software and services is a one stop shop insights driven platform across the categories of brand protection, logistics, inventory management, pricing, digital marketing, creative, tax and compliance among others, all accessible through a centralized portal. The platform has been developed over a period of 12 years and over $800 million in revenue has been processed through the platform.
 
The platform uses an insight driven approach to digital marketplace retailing using proprietary software. Using data collected from marketplaces, optimal inventory thresholds and purchasing trends are calculated within its advanced inventory management software developed in-house. etailz also has proprietary software related to pricing, advertisement management, marketplace seller tracking and channel auditing.
 
Additionally, the platform can be extended to various software and service providers, thereby enabling a network of partner integrations.

In 2020, etailz intends to expand this to companies: MyFBAPrep and VantageBP among others.
 
The platform lends itself to network effects. The more partners etailz has on its platform, the more data and insights it can collect. The more insights it gets, more products and services it can serve its partners and more marketplace integrations it can support. The more marketplace providers that can be integrated, the more partners etailz can acquire. This facilitates rapid scale.

Business Environment
 Digital marketplaces allow consumers to shop from a variety of merchants in one place and have become an integral part of many brand manufacturers’ businesses.
 
In the US, total estimated e-commerce sales for 2020 are projected at $604 billion, an increase of 9% from 2019. e-commerce sales in 2019 accounted for 11% of total retail sales as compared to 10% of total retail sales for 2018. Top marketplaces in the US include Amazon.com (2.3 billion visits per month), eBay.com (600 million visits per month) and Walmart.com (450 million visits per month). In 2019, Amazon represented 47% of U.S. retail e-commerce sales. Amazon’s third-party business is growing faster than its first party business . As of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Amazon’s third-party business was 52%, compared to 25% for its retail business.
 
There are several drivers of this growth including consumer preference for convenience, selection, personalization, opportunities, the ability to price compare, and delivery speed that are only found via e-commerce.
 
Globally, e-commerce sales are growing faster than physical store sales. According to global retail e-commerce statistics, e-commerce sales are projected to grow to $6.5 trillion, or 22% of total retail, by 2023 from $3.5 trillion in 2019, or 14.1 of total retail.

In 2020, etailz intends to expand its selling to marketplaces in Japan and Mexico.
 
Competition and Strategic Positioning
 etailz operates in a category within e-commerce called “Marketplace Growth Software and Services”. Businesses in this category provide services to brands and other sellers to facilitate growth on marketplaces. The market is very fragmented, and most providers are focused on a few focus areas where sellers have support needs. Subcategories in this market include: Account and Marketing Services, Supply Chain and Logistics Providers, Manufacturers and Product Suppliers, Legal Services and Accounting, Tax and Financial Services. In the Account and Marketing Services subcategory, services are further divided into retail services, agency services and software services. This is analogous to etailz’s business models – Retail as a Service, Agency as a Service and Software as a Service.
 
etailz positions itself as a comprehensive and fully customizable platform of software and services tailored towards online marketplace growth. etailz’s core focus is on the Account and Marketing Services subcategory and competes in this subcategory with Software Providers, Agencies and Retailers.
 
Revenue Distribution
 etailz’s primary source of revenue is through its “Retail as a Service” business, specifically as a third-party seller on the Amazon US marketplace (96% of net revenue in fiscal 2019). The remaining revenue is generated from other marketplaces including Amazon International, Walmart and eBay.
 
Approximately 66% of total etailz’s revenue in fiscal 2019 was generated by four major categories:  health & personal care; home/kitchen/grocery; tools/office/outdoor; and pets & sporting goods.
