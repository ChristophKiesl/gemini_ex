Item 1. | Business

Overview
SunCoke Energy, Inc. (“SunCoke Energy,” “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us”) is the largest independent producer of high-quality coke in the Americas, as measured by tons of coke produced each year, and has more than 50 years of coke production experience. Coke is a principal raw material in the blast furnace steelmaking process and is produced by heating metallurgical coal in a refractory oven, which releases certain volatile components from the coal, thus transforming the coal into coke. We also provide coal handling and/or mixing services at our Coal Logistics terminals to steel, coke (including some of our domestic cokemaking facilities), electric utility and coal mining customers. 
Our consolidated financial statements include SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P. (the "Partnership"), a publicly-traded master limited partnership. As of December 31, 2016, we owned the general partner of the Partnership, which owns a 2.0 percent general partner interest and incentive distribution rights ("IDRs") in the Partnership, and owned a 53.9 percent limited partner interest in the Partnership. The remaining 44.1 percent interest in the Partnership was held by public unitholders.
On October 31, 2016, the Company announced that it had submitted a proposal to the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Partnership to acquire all of the Partnership’s common units not already owned by the Company ("Simplification Transaction"). The proposed transaction is to be structured as a merger of the Partnership with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documents and approval of our Board of Directors and the Conflicts Committee of the Partnership's Board of Directors. The Conflicts Committee, which is composed of only the independent directors of the Board of Directors of the Partnership’s general partner, is considering the proposal pursuant to applicable procedures established in the Partnership’s partnership agreement and the Conflicts Committee’s charter. The transaction also will require majority approval of our common stockholders. We own a majority of the Partnership's common units and intend to vote in favor of the transaction. The proposed Simplification Transaction is also conditioned upon receipt of customary regulatory approvals. 
Incorporated in Delaware since 2010 and headquartered in Lisle, Illinois, we became a publicly-traded company in 2011 and our stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “SXC.”

(1) | Cokemaking capacity represents stated capacity for production of blast furnace coke. Middletown production and sales volumes are based on “run of oven” capacity, which includes both blast furnace coke and small coke. Using the stated capacity, Middletown capacity on a “run of oven” basis is approximately 578 thousand tons per year.


(2) | We hold a 49 percent investment in a cokemaking joint venture with VISA Steel Limited ("VISA Steel") in India called VISA SunCoke Limited ("VISA SunCoke"), which was fully impaired in 2015, and consequently, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we no longer included our share of VISA SunCoke in our financial results. Cokemaking capacity represents 100 percent of VISA SunCoke. 

We are a technological leader in cokemaking. We have designed, developed, built, own and operate five cokemaking facilities in the United States (“U.S.”) with collective nameplate capacity to produce approximately 4.2 million tons of coke per year. Additionally, we have designed and operate one cokemaking facility in Brazil under licensing and operating agreements on behalf of ArcelorMittal Brasil S.A. ("ArcelorMittal Brazil”), which has approximately 1.7 million tons of annual cokemaking capacity. Our cokemaking ovens utilize efficient, modern heat recovery technology designed to combust the coal’s volatile components liberated during the cokemaking process and use the resulting heat to create steam or electricity for sale. This differs from by-product cokemaking, which repurposes the coal’s liberated volatile components for other uses. We have constructed the only greenfield cokemaking facilities in the U.S. in more than 25 years and are the only North American coke producer that utilizes heat recovery technology in the cokemaking process. 
We believe our advanced heat recovery cokemaking process has numerous advantages over by-product cokemaking, including producing higher quality coke, using waste heat to generate derivative energy for resale and reducing the environmental impact. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 specifically directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to evaluate our heat recovery coke oven technology as a basis for establishing Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards for new cokemaking facilities. In addition, each of the four cokemaking facilities that we have built since 1990 has either met or exceeded the applicable Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”), or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (“LAER”) standards, as applicable, set forth by the EPA for cokemaking facilities at that time. 
Our Granite City facility, the first phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill I, and our VISA SunCoke joint venture have steam generation facilities, which use hot flue gas from the cokemaking process to produce steam for sale to customers pursuant to steam supply and purchase agreements. Granite City sells steam to United States Steel Corporation ("U.S. Steel"), VISA SunCoke sells steam to VISA Steel and Haverhill I provides steam, at no cost, to Altivia 
2

Petrochemicals, LLC ("Altivia"), which purchased its facility out of bankruptcy from a third-party, Haverhill Chemicals LLC, in 2015. Altivia provides boiler feed water to Haverhill I, which enables the heat recovery steam generators to operate. The heat recovery steam generators cool the flue gas for desulfurization and produce steam. While the Company is not currently generating revenues from providing steam to Altivia, the current arrangement, for which rates may be renegotiated beginning in 2018, mitigates costs associated with disposing of steam. In an effort to mitigate risks associated with any potential disruptions to the boiler feed water, the Partnership began a capital project in 2016, which it expects to complete in 2017, to allow Haverhill I to procure its own boiler feed water. The Partnership anticipates investing approximately $3 million in this project, of which $1.9 million was spent in 2016. Our Middletown facility and the second phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill II, have cogeneration plants that use the hot flue gas created by the cokemaking process to generate electricity, which either is sold into the regional power market or to AK Steel Holding Corporation ("AK Steel") pursuant to energy sales agreements. 
Our core business model is predicated on providing steelmakers an alternative to investing capital in their own captive coke production facilities. We direct our marketing efforts principally towards steelmaking customers that require coke for use in their blast furnaces. Substantially all our coke sales are made pursuant to long-term, take-or-pay agreements with ArcelorMittal S.A. ("ArcelorMittal"), AK Steel and U.S. Steel, who are three of the largest blast furnace steelmakers in North America, each of which individually accounts for greater than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. The take-or-pay provisions require us to produce the contracted volumes of coke and require our customers to purchase such volumes of coke up to a specified tonnage or pay the contract price for any tonnage they elect not to take. As a result, our ability to produce the contracted coke volume is a key determinant of our profitability. We generally do not have significant spot coke sales since our domestic capacity is consumed by long-term contracts; accordingly, spot prices for coke do not generally affect our revenues. To date, our coke customers have satisfied their obligations under these agreements.
Our coke sales agreements have an average remaining term of approximately eight years and contain pass-through provisions for costs we incur in the cokemaking process, including coal and coal procurement costs, subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke yields, operating and maintenance expenses, costs related to the transportation of coke to our customers, taxes (other than income taxes) and costs associated with changes in regulation. When targeted coal-to-coke yields are achieved, the price of coal is not a significant determining factor in the profitability of these facilities, although it does affect our revenue and cost of sales for these facilities in approximately equal amounts. However, to the extent that the actual coal-to-coke yields are less than the contractual standard, we are responsible for the cost of the excess coal used in the cokemaking process. Conversely, to the extent our actual coal-to-coke yields are higher than the contractual standard, we realize gains. As coal prices increase, the benefits associated with favorable coal-to-coke yields also increase. These features of our coke sales agreements reduce our exposure to variability in coal price changes and inflationary costs over the remaining terms of these agreements. The coal component of the Jewell coke price is fixed annually for each calendar year based on the weighted-average contract price of third-party coal purchases at our Haverhill facility applicable to ArcelorMittal coke sales.
 Our coke prices include both an operating cost component and a fixed fee component. Operating costs under three of our coke sales agreements are fixed subject to an annual adjustment based on an inflation index. Under our other three coke sales agreements, operating costs are passed through to the respective customers subject to an annually negotiated budget, in some cases subject to a cap annually adjusted for inflation, and we share any difference in costs from the budgeted amounts with our customers. Beginning in 2015, the operating and maintenance cost recovery mechanism in our Indiana Harbor coke sales agreement shifted from an annually negotiated budget amount with a cap to a fixed recovery per ton. Accordingly, actual operating costs in excess of caps or budgets can have a significant impact on the profitability of all of our domestic cokemaking facilities. In 2018, the operating cost component of our contract at Indiana Harbor reverts to an annually negotiated budget, which is expected to have a favorable impact on our future results. The fixed fee component for each ton of coke sold to the customer is determined at the time the coke sales agreement is signed and is effective for the term of each sales agreement. The fixed fee is intended to provide an adequate return on invested capital and may differ based on investment levels and other considerations. The actual return on invested capital at any facility is based on the fixed fee per ton and favorable or unfavorable performance on pass-through cost items.
The coke sales agreement and energy sales agreement with AK Steel at our Haverhill facility are subject to early termination by AK Steel under limited circumstances, such as AK Steel permanently shutting down operation of the iron production portion of its Ashland plant and not acquiring or beginning construction of a new blast furnace in the U.S. to replace, in whole or in part, the Ashland plant's iron production capacity, and provided that AK Steel has given at least two years prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreement and certain other conditions are met. No other coke sales contract has an early termination clause.

While our steelmaking customers are operating in an environment that is challenged by global overcapacity, our customers have been able to strengthen their capital and liquidity structure by raising debt and equity during 2016. Additionally, 2016 saw a decline in steel imports compared to 2015, a rebound in steel pricing and positive signals from the new presidential administration on trade and infrastructure. Despite the improved market trends in 2016, AK Steel and U.S. Steel have kept portions of their Ashland Kentucky Works facility and Granite City Works facility idled as they await further signs of market stability. Despite market challenges, our customers continue to comply with the terms of their long-term, take-or-pay contracts with us. 
Revenues from our Brazilian cokemaking facility are derived from licensing and operating fees, which include a fixed annual licensing fee, a licensing fee based upon the level of production required by our customer and full pass-through of the operating costs of the facility. 
On November 28, 2016, ArcelorMittal Brazil redeemed SunCoke’s indirectly held preferred and common equity interest in Sol Coqueria Tubarão S.A. ("Brazil Investment") for consideration of $41.0 million, an amount equal to our carrying value of the investment. The Company received $20.5 million in cash at closing and will receive the remaining $20.5 million in cash, plus interest at an annual interest rate of 3 percent, in the second quarter of 2017. With the redemption of the Brazil Investment, the Company will no longer receive the $9.5 million annual preferred dividend. Additionally, in 2016, SunCoke added certain new patents to its existing intellectual property licensing agreement for which SunCoke will earn an incremental $5.1 million in annual licensing fees through 2023. The Company also extended the life of its patents with the Brazilian authorities through 2033, providing opportunity to extend the existing licensing agreement beyond 2023. 
Coal Logistics Operations
Our Coal Logistics segment consists of CMT, KRT, Lake Terminal and DRT. CMT is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast. CMT provides strategic access to seaborne markets for coal and other industrial materials. Supporting low-cost Illinois basin coal producers, the terminal provides loading and unloading services and has direct rail access and the current capability to transload 15 million tons of coal annually due to its recently commissioned ship loader. The facility is supported by long-term contracts with volume commitments covering 10 million tons of its coal handling capacity as well as 350 thousand liquid tons and additional merchant coal business. KRT is a leading metallurgical and thermal coal mixing and handling terminal service provider with collective capacity to mix and transload 25 million tons of coal annually through its two operations in West Virginia. Lake Terminal is located in East Chicago, Indiana and provides coal handling and mixing services to SunCoke's Indiana Harbor cokemaking operations. DRT was formed in 2016 to accommodate our Jewell cokemaking facility in its direct procurement of third-party coal.
Our five coal handling terminals have the collective capacity to mix and/or transload more than 40 million tons of coal annually and have storage capacity of approximately 3 million tons. Our coal terminals act as intermediaries between coal producers and coal end users by providing transloading, storage and mixing services. Coal is transported from the mine site in numerous ways, including rail, truck, barge or ship. We do not take possession of coal but instead derive our revenues by providing coal handling and/or mixing services to our customers on a per ton basis. Revenues are recognized when services are provided as defined by customer contracts. For CMT, cash received from customers for quarterly take-or-pay billings based on pro-rata volume commitments under take-or-pay contracts that is in excess of cash earned for services provided during the quarter is recorded as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue on take-or-pay contracts is recognized into income at the earlier of when service is provided or annually based on the terms of the contract. Our coal mixing and/or handling services are provided to steel, coal mining, coke (including some of our domestic cokemaking facilities) and electric utility customers. Services provided to our domestic cokemaking facilities are provided under contracts with terms equivalent to those of an arm's-length transactions.
The financial performance of our coal logistics business is substantially dependent upon a limited number of customers. Our CMT customers are impacted by seaborne export market dynamics. Fluctuations in the benchmark price for coal delivery into northwest Europe, as referenced in the Argus/McCloskey's Coal Price Index report ("API2 index price"), contribute to our customers' decisions to place tons into the export market and thus impact transloading volumes through our terminal facility. Our KRT terminals are primarily impacted by the domestic coal markets in which its customers operate and generally benefit from extreme weather conditions. 
While the thermal and metallurgical coal markets were severely challenged during the first half of 2016, they improved over the second half of the year.  At least four formerly bankrupt major coal producers have emerged from reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and a number of formerly idled coal mines have been brought back into service.  Additionally, domestic and global metallurgical and thermal coal prices have surged from previous lows during early 2016, resulting in improved mining economics for our customers, which significantly increased 
4

tonnage at our terminals in the fourth quarter of 2016. The API2 index price at the end of 2016 more than doubled from lows in early 2016 as a result of natural gas storage issues and reduced nuclear power and hydropower generation in Europe. Domestically, natural gas prices have stabilized and slightly increased since March 2016, which has improved the economics of coal-fired electric generating stations and led to an increase in demand for coal, and therefore, increased the potential for higher volumes of coal logistics services.
Coal Mining Operations 
The domestic metallurgical coal markets remained challenged during early 2016 as the drastic and sustained decline in coal prices led to several coal producers filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Despite our own diligent efforts to reduce costs by rationalizing our mining footprint, this challenged environment was likely to prevent us from generating positive cash flow from our mining operations for the foreseeable future. As a result, we divested our Coal Mining business in April 2016, which included approximately 250 acres of land owned in Russell County, Virginia and approximately 90 thousand acres of leased small parcels of land, mineral rights and coal mining rights in Buchanan and Russell Counties, Virginia and McDowell County, West Virginia. We entered into a coal supply agreement whereby the buyer, Revelation Energy, LLC ("Revelation"), will supply approximately 300,000 tons of coal to our Jewell cokemaking facility annually for five years at a market rate. The delivered cost, as compared to alternative coal sources, is favorable due to the proximity of the Jewell cokemaking facility to the mines. The Company retained certain asset retirement obligations related to certain contractual obligations, including the retirement and removal of long-lived assets from certain properties associated with our former coal mining business.
Seasonality
Our revenues in our cokemaking business and much of our coal logistics business are tied to long-term, take-or-pay contracts and as such, are not seasonal. However, our cokemaking profitability is tied to coal-to-coke yields, which improve in drier weather. Accordingly, the coal-to-coke yield component of our profitability tends to be more favorable in the third quarter. Extreme weather may also challenge our operating costs and production in the winter months for our domestic coke business. Additionally, excessively hot summer weather or cold winter weather, may increase commercial and residential needs for heat or air conditioning which in turn, may increase electricity usage and the demand for thermal coal and, therefore, may favorably impact our coal logistics business.
Raw Materials
Metallurgical coal is the principal raw material for our cokemaking operations. All of the metallurgical coal used to produce coke at our domestic cokemaking facilities is purchased from third-parties. We believe there is an ample supply of metallurgical coal available in the U.S. and worldwide, and we have been able to supply coal to our domestic cokemaking facilities without any significant disruption in coke production.
Each ton of coke produced at our facilities requires approximately 1.4 tons of metallurgical coal. We purchased 5.5 million tons of metallurgical coal in 2016. Coal from third-parties is generally purchased on an annual basis via one-year contracts with costs passed through to our customers in accordance with the applicable coke sales agreements. Occasionally, shortfalls in deliveries by coal suppliers require us to procure supplemental coal volumes. As with typical annual purchases, the cost of these supplemental purchases is also passed through to our customers. In 2017, certain of our coal contracts contain an option, at the Company's discretion, to reduce our commitment by up to 15 percent. Most coal procurement decisions are made through a coal committee structure with customer participation. The customer can generally exercise an overriding vote on most coal procurement decisions.
While we generally pass coal costs through to our coke customers, all of our contracts include some form of coal-to-coke yield standard. To the extent that our actual yields are less than the standard in the contract, we are at risk for the cost of the excess coal used in the cokemaking process. Conversely, to the extent actual yields are higher than contractual standards we are able to realize higher margins.
Transportation and Freight
For inbound transportation of coal purchases, our facilities that access a single rail provider have long-term transportation agreements, and where necessary, coal-mixing agreements that run concurrently with the associated coke sales agreement for the facility. At facilities with multiple transportation options, including rail and barge, we enter into short-term transportation contracts from year to year. For coke sales, the point of delivery varies by agreement and facility. The point of delivery for coke sales from our Jewell and Haverhill cokemaking facilities is generally designated by the customer and shipments are made by railcar under long-term transportation agreements held by us. All delivery costs are passed through to the customers. At our Middletown, Indiana Harbor and Granite City cokemaking facilities, coke is delivered primarily by a conveyor belt leading to the customer’s blast furnace, with the customer responsible for additional 
5

transportation costs, if any. All transportation and freight costs in our Coal Logistics segment are paid by the customer directly to the transportation provider.
Research and Development and Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our research and development program seeks to develop promising new cokemaking technologies and improve our heat recovery processes. Over the years, this program has produced numerous patents related to our heat recovery coking design and operation, including patents for pollution control systems, oven pushing and charging mechanisms, oven flue gas control mechanisms and various others.
At Indiana Harbor and Vitória, Brazil, where we do not own 100 percent of the entity owning the cokemaking facility, we have licensing agreements in place for the entity’s use of our technology. At Indiana Harbor, we receive no payment for the licensing rights. At Vitória, starting in 2016, in addition to the current per ton licensing fee, SunCoke will receive an incremental $5.1 million in licensing fees per year through 2023 related to the addition of certain patents to its existing intellectual property licensing agreement, which are currently in use by ArcelorMittal Brazil at the Brazil facility. At VISA SunCoke, our joint venture with VISA Steel in India, our technology is not currently in use, but the parties have agreed to enter into a license agreement should our technology be used in the future.
We are party to an omnibus agreement with the Partnership, which grants the Partnership a royalty-free license to use the name “SunCoke” and related trademarks. Additionally, the omnibus agreement grants the Partnership a non-exclusive right to use all of our current and future cokemaking and related technology necessary for their operations.
Competition
Cokemaking
The cokemaking business is highly competitive. Most of the world’s coke production capacity is owned by blast furnace steel companies utilizing by-product coke oven technology. The international merchant coke market is largely supplied by Chinese, Colombian and Ukrainian producers, among others, though it is difficult to maintain high quality coke in the export market, and when coupled with transportation costs, coke imports into the U.S. are often not economical.
The principal competitive factors affecting our cokemaking business include coke quality and price, reliability of supply, proximity to market, access to metallurgical coals and environmental performance. Our oven design and heat recovery technology plays a role in all of these factors. Competitors include merchant coke producers as well as the cokemaking facilities owned and operated by blast furnace steel companies. 
In the past, there have been technologies which have sought to produce carbonaceous substitutes for coke in the blast furnace. While none have proven commercially viable thus far, we monitor the development of competing technologies carefully. We also monitor ferrous technologies, such as direct reduced iron production ("DRI"), as these could indirectly impact our blast furnace customers.
We believe we are well-positioned to compete with other coke producers. Current production from our cokemaking business is largely committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts. As a result, competition mainly affects our ability to obtain new contracts supporting development of additional cokemaking capacity, re-contracting existing facilities, as well as the sale of coke in the spot market. Our facilities were constructed using proven, industry-leading technology with many proprietary features allowing us to produce consistently higher quality coke than our competitors produce. Additionally, our technology allows us to produce heat that can be converted into steam or electrical power.
Coal Logistics
The coal mixing and/or handling service market is highly competitive in the geographic area of our operations. The principal competitive factors affecting our coal logistics business include proximity to the source of coal as well as the nature and price of our services provided. We believe we are well-positioned to compete with other coal mixing and/or handling terminal service providers. 
Our KRT competitors are generally located within 100 miles of our operations. KRT has state-of-the-art mixing capabilities with fully automated and computer-controlled mixing that mixes coal to within two percent accuracy of customer specifications. KRT also has the ability to provide pad storage and has access to both CSX and Norfolk Southern rail lines as well as the Ohio River system. 
The principal competitors of CMT, who serve the coal export market, are located on the U.S. Gulf Coast or U.S. East Coast. CMT is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast and provides strategic access to seaborne markets for coal and other industrial materials. In 2016, CMT built a new state-of-the-art ship loader, which allows for faster coal loading onto larger ships. We believe the new ship loader has the fastest loading rate available in the Gulf 
6

Region which should allow our customers to benefit from lower shipping costs. Additionally, CMT is the only terminal in the lower U.S. with direct rail access on the Canadian National Railway, which provides a competitive advantage.
Lake Terminal and DRT provide coal handling and/or mixing services to our Indiana Harbor and Jewell cokemaking facilities, respectively, and therefore, do not have any competitors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we have approximately 907 employees in the U.S. Approximately 38 percent of our domestic employees, principally at our cokemaking operations, are represented by the United Steelworkers union under various contracts. Additionally, approximately 3 percent of our domestic employees are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers. The labor agreement at our Indiana Harbor cokemaking facility expired on September 1, 2015. Operations have continued under the expired contract with the renewal pending resolution of select key economic provisions. We do not anticipate any work stoppages during the continued negotiations. The labor agreement at our Granite City cokemaking facility will expire on August 31, 2017. We will negotiate the renewal of this agreement in 2017 and do not anticipate any work stoppages.
As of December 31, 2016, we have approximately 267 employees at the cokemaking facility in Vitória, Brazil, all of whom are represented by a union under a labor agreement.  In 2016, we reached a new one-year labor agreement at our Vitoria, Brazil facility which will expire on October 31, 2017.  We will negotiate the renewal of this agreement in 2017 and do not anticipate any work stoppages. 
Safety
We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment and ensuring strict environmental compliance across all of our operations as the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate are critical to our success. We believe that we employ best practices and conduct continual training programs to ensure that all of our employees are focused on safety. Furthermore, we employ a structured safety and environmental process that provides a robust framework for managing and monitoring safety and environmental performance.
We have consistently operated within the top quartile for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s recordable injury rates as measured and reported by the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute.
Legal and Regulatory Requirements
The following discussion summarizes the principal legal and regulatory requirements that we believe may significantly affect us.
Permitting and Bonding

• | Permitting Process for Cokemaking Facilities. The permitting process for our cokemaking facilities is administered by the individual states. However, the main requirements for obtaining environmental construction and operating permits are found in the federal regulations. Once all requirements are satisfied, a state or local agency produces an initial draft permit. Generally, the facility reviews and comments on the initial draft. After accepting or rejecting the facility’s comments, the agency typically publishes a notice regarding the issuance of the draft permit and makes the permit and supporting documents available for public review and comment. A public hearing may be scheduled, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") also has the opportunity to comment on the draft permit. The state or local agency responds to comments on the draft permit and may make revisions before a final construction permit is issued. A construction permit allows construction and commencement of operations of the facility and is generally valid for at least 18 months. Generally, construction commences during this period, while many states allow this period to be extended in certain situations.


• | Air Quality. Our cokemaking facilities employ Maximum Available Control Technology (“MACT”) standards designed to limit emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants. Specific MACT standards apply to door leaks, charging, oven pressure, pushing and quenching. Certain MACT standards for new cokemaking facilities were developed using test data from SunCoke's Jewell cokemaking facility located in Vansant, Virginia. Under applicable federal air quality regulations, permitting requirements may differ among facilities, depending upon whether the cokemaking facility will be located in an “attainment” area—i.e., one that meets the national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) for certain pollutants, or in a “non-attainment” or "unclassifiable" area. The status of an area may change over time as new NAAQS standards are adopted, resulting in an area change from one status or classification to another. In an attainment area, the facility must install air pollution control equipment or employ Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”). 

7

In a non-attainment area, the facility must install air pollution control equipment or employ procedures that meet Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (“LAER”) standards. LAER standards are the most stringent emission limitation achieved in practice by existing facilities. Unlike the BACT analysis, cost is generally not considered as part of a LAER analysis, and emissions in a non-attainment area must be offset by emission reductions obtained from other sources.

• | Stringent NAAQS for ambient nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide went into effect in 2010. In July 2013, the EPA identified or "designated" as non-attainment 29 areas in 16 states where monitored air quality showed violations of the 2010 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. In August 2015, the EPA finalized a new rulemaking to assist in implementation of the primary 1-hour SO2 NAAQS that requires either additional monitoring, or modeling of ambient air SO2 levels in various areas including where certain of our facilities are located. By July 2016, states subject to this rulemaking were required to provide EPA with either a modeling approach using existing emissions data, or a plan to undertake ambient air monitoring for SO2 to begin in 2017. For states that choose to install ambient air SO2 monitoring stations, after three years of data has been collected, or sometime in 2020, the EPA will evaluate this data relative to the appropriate attainment designation for the areas under the 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. This rulemaking will require certain of our facilities to undertake this ambient air monitoring. We may be required to install additional pollution controls and incur greater costs of operating at those of our facilities located in areas that EPA determines to be non-attainment with the 1-hour SO2 NAAQS based on its evaluation of this data. In 2012, a NAAQS for fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, went into effect. In November 2015, the EPA revised the existing NAAQS for ground level ozone to make the standard more stringent. These new standards and any future more stringent standard for ozone have two impacts on permitting: (1) demonstrating compliance with the standard using dispersion modeling from a new facility will be more difficult; and (2) additional areas of the country may become designated as non-attainment areas. Facilities operating in areas that become non-attainment areas due to the application of new standards may be required to install Reasonably Available Control Technology (“RACT”). A number of states have also filed or joined suits to challenge the EPA’s new standard in court. While we are not able to determine the extent to which this new standard will impact our business at this time, it does have the potential to have a material impact on our operations and cost structure. 


• | The EPA adopted a rule in 2010 requiring a new facility that is a major source of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) to install equipment or employ BACT procedures. Currently, there is little information on what may be acceptable as BACT to control GHGs (primarily carbon dioxide from our facilities), but the database and additional guidance may be enhanced in the future.


• | Several states have additional requirements and standards other than those in the federal statutes and regulations. Many states have lists of “air toxics” with emission limitations determined by dispersion modeling. States also often have specific regulations that deal with visible emissions, odors and nuisance. In some cases, the state delegates some or all of these functions to local agencies.


• | Wastewater and Stormwater. Our heat recovery cokemaking technology does not produce process wastewater as is typically associated with by-product cokemaking. Our cokemaking facilities, in some cases, have wastewater discharge and stormwater permits.


• | Waste. The primary solid waste product from our heat recovery cokemaking technology is calcium sulfate from flue gas desulfurization, which is generally taken to a solid waste landfill. The material from periodic cleaning of heat recovery steam generators is disposed of as hazardous waste. On the whole, our heat recovery cokemaking process does not generate substantial quantities of hazardous waste.


• | U.S. Endangered Species Act. The U.S. Endangered Species Act and certain counterpart state regulations are intended to protect species whose populations allow for categorization as either endangered or threatened. With respect to permitting additional cokemaking facilities, protection of endangered or threatened species may have the effect of prohibiting, limiting the extent of or placing permitting conditions on soil removal, road building and other activities in areas containing the affected species. Based on the species that have been designated as endangered or threatened on our properties and the current application of these laws and regulations, we do not believe that they are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations.


• | Permitting Process for Former Coal Mining Operations. The U.S. coal mining permit application process is initiated by collecting baseline data to adequately assess and model the pre-mine environmental condition of the permit area, including geologic data, soil and rock structures, cultural resources, soils, surface and

8

ground water hydrology, and coal that we intend to mine. We use this data to develop a mine and reclamation plan, which incorporate provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”), state programs and complementary environmental programs that impact coal mining. The permit application includes the mine and reclamation plan, documents defining ownership and agreements pertaining to coal, minerals, oil and gas, water rights, rights of way and surface land and documents required by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s (“OSM’s”) Applicant Violator System. Once a permit application is submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness and technical review before a public notice and comment period. Some SMCRA mine permits take over a year to prepare, depending on the size and complexity of the mine, and often take six months to two years to be issued. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public has the right to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including through public hearings and intervention in the courts. Final guidance released by the CEQ regarding climate change considerations in the NEPA analyses may increase the likelihood of future challenges to the NEPA documents prepared for actions requiring federal approval. SMCRA mine permits also take a significant period of time to be transferred.

• | Bonding Requirements for Permits Related to Former Coal Mining Operations. Before a SMCRA permit is issued, a mine operator must submit a bond or other form of financial security to guarantee the payment and performance of certain long-term mine closure and reclamation obligations. The costs of these bonds or other forms of financial security have fluctuated in recent years and the market terms of surety bonds generally have become more unfavorable to mine operators. Surety providers are requiring greater amounts of collateral to secure a bond, which has required us to provide increasing quantities of cash to collateralize bonds or other forms of financial security to allow us to continue mining. These changes in the terms of the bonds have been accompanied, at times, by a decrease in the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds. As of December 31, 2016, we have posted an aggregate of approximately $25 million in surety bonds or other forms of financial security for reclamation purposes.

Regulation of Operations 

• | Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act and similar state laws and regulations affect our cokemaking operations, primarily through permitting and/or emissions control requirements relating to particulate matter (“PM”) and sulfur dioxide (“SO2”). The Clean Air Act air emissions programs that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to: the Acid Rain Program; NAAQS implementation for SO2, PM and nitrogen oxides (“NOx”); GHG rules; the Clean Air Interstate Rule; MACT emissions limits for hazardous air pollutants; the Regional Haze Program; New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”); and New Source Review. The Clean Air Act requires, among other things, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of various industry-specific MACT standards. Our cokemaking facilities are subject to two categories of MACT standards. The first category applies to pushing and quenching. The EPA is to make a risk-based determination for pushing and quenching emissions and determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary, but the EPA has yet to publish or propose any residual risk standards; therefore, the impact of potential additional EPA regulation in this area cannot be estimated at this time. The second category of MACT standards applicable to our cokemaking facilities applies to emissions from charging and coke oven doors.


• | Terminal Operations. Our terminal operations located along waterways and the Gulf of Mexico are also governed by permitting requirements under the CWA and CAA. These terminals are subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations and comparable state statutes regarding design, installation, construction, and management. Many such terminals owned and operated by other entities that are also used to transport coal, including for export, have been pursued by environmental interest groups for alleged violations of their permits’ requirements, or have seen their efforts to obtain or renew such permits contested by such groups. While we believe that our operations are in material compliance with these permits, we cannot assure you that no such challenges or claims will be made against our operations in the future. Moreover, our terminal operations may be affected by the impacts of additional regulation on the mining of all types of coal and use of thermal coal for fuel, which is restricting supply in some markets and may reduce the volumes of coal that our terminals manage. 


• | Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the sales of electricity from our Haverhill and Middletown facilities, including the implementation of the Federal Power Act (“FPA”) and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”). The nature of the operations of the Haverhill and Middletown facilities makes each facility a qualifying facility under 

9

PURPA, which exempts the facilities and the Company from certain regulatory burdens, including the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (“PUHCA”), limited provisions of the FPA, and certain state laws and regulation. FERC has granted requests for authority to sell electricity from the Haverhill and Middletown facilities at market-based rates and the entities are subject to FERC’s market-based rate regulations, which require regular regulatory compliance filings. 

• | Clean Water Act of 1972. Although our cokemaking facilities generally do not have water discharge permits, the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) may affect our operations by requiring water quality standards generally and through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”). Regular monitoring, reporting requirements and performance standards are requirements of NPDES permits that govern the discharge of pollutants into water. Discharges must either meet state water quality standards or be authorized through available regulatory processes such as alternate standards or variances. Additionally, through the CWA Section 401 certification program, states have approval authority over federal permits or licenses that might result in a discharge to their waters.


• | Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We may generate wastes, including “solid” wastes and “hazardous” wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, although certain mining and mineral beneficiation wastes and certain wastes derived from the combustion of coal currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The EPA has limited the disposal options for certain wastes that are designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA. Furthermore, it is possible that certain wastes generated by our operations that currently are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly management, disposal and clean-up requirements.


• | Climate Change Legislation and Regulations. Our facilities are presently subject to the GHG reporting rule, which obligates us to report annual emissions of GHGs. The EPA also finalized a rule in 2010 requiring a new facility that is a major source of GHGs to install equipment or employ BACT procedures. Currently there is little information as to what may constitute BACT for GHG in most industries. We may also be subject to the EPA’s “Tailoring Rule,” where certain modifications to our facilities could subject us to the additional permitting and other obligations relative to emissions of GHGs under the New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("NSR/PSD") and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act based on whether the facility triggered NSR/PSD because of emissions of another pollutant such as SO2, NOx, PM, ozone or lead. The EPA has engaged in rulemaking to regulate GHG emissions from existing and new coal fired power plants, and we expect continued legal challenges to this rulemaking and any future rulemaking for other industries. For instance, in August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan rules establishing carbon pollution standards for power plants. The EPA expects each state to develop implementation plans for power plants in its state to meet the individual state targets established in the Clean Power Plan, and has also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the Clean Power Plan in the event that approvable state plans are not submitted. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the Clean Power Plan before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (“D.C. Circuit”) issued a decision on the rule. By its terms, this stay will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process including at the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court through any certiorari petition that may be granted. Additionally, it is unclear how the Clean Power Plan will be impacted by the actions of the new presidential administration beginning in 2017. Depending on the method of implementation selected by the states, and whether the rule is ultimately upheld, the Clean Power Plan could increase the demand for natural gas-generated electricity. 


• | Currently, we do not anticipate these new or existing power plan GHG rules to apply directly to our facilities. However, the impact current and future GHG-related legislation and regulations have on us will depend on a number of factors, including whether GHG sources in multiple sectors of the economy are regulated, the overall GHG emissions cap level, the degree to which GHG offsets are allowed, the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, actions by the states in implementing these requirements and the indirect impact of carbon regulation on coal prices. We may not recover the costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements imposed on us from our customers due to limitations in our agreements. The imposition of a carbon tax or similar regulation could materially and adversely affect our revenues. Collectively, these requirements along with restrictions and requirements regarding the mining of all types of coal may reduce the volumes of coal that we manage and may ultimately adversely impact our revenues.

• | Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006. The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (the “Miner Act”), has increased significantly the enforcement of safety and health standards and imposed safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations. There also has been a significant increase in the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued.


• | Security. CMT is subject to regulation by the United States Coast Guard pursuant to the Maritime Transportation Security Act. We have an internal inspection program designed to monitor and ensure compliance by CMT with these requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of the facility. 

Reclamation and Remediation

• | Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The SMCRA established comprehensive operational, environmental, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of U.S. surface mining as well as many aspects of deep mining. Where state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the regulatory authority, and states that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards that are more stringent than the requirements of SMCRA. Permitting under SMCRA generally has become more difficult in recent years, which adversely affects the cost and availability of coal. The Abandoned Mine Land Fund, which is part of SMCRA, assesses a fee on all coal produced in the U.S. From October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2012, the fee was $0.315 per ton of surface-mined coal and $0.135 per ton of underground mined coal. From October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2021, the fee has been reduced to $0.28 per ton of surface-mined coal and $0.12 per ton of underground mined coal. Our reclamation obligations under applicable environmental laws could be substantial. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), we are required to account for the costs related to the closure of mines and the reclamation of the land upon exhaustion of coal reserves. The fair value of an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. At December 31, 2016, we had asset retirement obligation of $4.9 million related to estimated mine reclamation costs. The amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit-adjusted interest rates. Our future operating results would be adversely affected if these accruals were determined to be insufficient. These obligations are unfunded. Further, although specific criteria varies from state to state as to what constitutes an “owner” or “controller” relationship, under SMCRA the responsibility for reclamation or remediation, unabated violations, unpaid civil penalties and unpaid reclamation fees of independent contract mine operators can be imputed to other companies which are deemed, according to the regulations, to have “owned” or “controlled” the contract mine operator. Sanctions are quite severe and can include being denied new permits, permit amendments, permit revisions and revocation or suspension of permits issued since the violation or penalty or fee due date.


• | Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981. Under these laws, each U.S. coal mine operator must pay federal black lung benefits and medical expenses to claimants who are current and former employees and last worked for the operator after July 1, 1973. Coal mine operators also must make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to July 1, 1973. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on U.S. coal production of up to $1.10 per ton for deep-mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4 percent of the gross sales price. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), which was implemented in 2010, amended previous legislation and provides for the automatic extension of awarded lifetime benefits to surviving spouses and changes the legal criteria used to assess and award claims. Our obligation related to black lung benefits at December 31, 2016 was $50.2 million and was estimated based on various assumptions, including actuarial estimates, discount rates, number of active claims, changes in health care costs and the impact of PPACA.

• | Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as Superfund, and similar state laws, responsibility for the entire cost of clean-up of a contaminated site, as well as natural resource damages, can be imposed upon current or former site owners or operators, or upon any party who released one or more designated “hazardous substances” at the site, regardless of the lawfulness of the original activities that led to the contamination. In the course of our operations we may have generated and may generate wastes that fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We also may be an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators. Under CERCLA, we may be responsible for all or part of the costs of cleaning up facilities at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages. We also must comply with reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act.

Environmental Matters and Compliance
Our failure to comply with the aforementioned requirements may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of clean-up and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations. Please see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Notices of Violation ("NOVs") issued by the EPA and state regulators for our Haverhill, Granite City, and Indiana Harbor cokemaking facilities.
Many other legal and administrative proceedings are pending or may be brought against us arising out of our current and past operations, including matters related to commercial and tax disputes, product liability, antitrust, employment claims, natural resource damage claims, premises-liability claims, allegations of exposures of third-parties to toxic substances and general environmental claims. Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time, it is reasonably possible that some of them could be resolved unfavorably to us. Management of the Company believes that any liability which may arise from such matters would not be material in relation to the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company at December 31, 2016.
IRS Final Regulations on Qualifying Income
Section 7704 of the code provides that a publicly-traded partnership will be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. However, if 90 percent or more of a partnership’s gross income for every taxable year it is publicly-traded consists of “qualifying income,” the publicly-traded partnership may continue to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
 At the time of the Partnership’s initial public offering, in January 2013, the Partnership believed, and received a legal opinion to the effect, that income from its cokemaking operations would be treated as generating qualifying income under the Code.  The Company and counsel believed at the time that this view was based on the correct interpretation of the Code and the legislative history of the relevant Code section, and since that time continued to believe that income from its cokemaking operations is qualifying income. 
In May, 2015, the IRS released new proposed regulations (the “Proposed Regulations”) which would have substantially changed the rules relating to qualifying income for publicly-traded partnerships for the processing, refining and transportation of minerals or natural resources, and created ambiguity as to whether cokemaking generates qualifying income. Following the release of the Proposed Regulations, representatives of the Partnership, together with counsel, submitted comments and gave testimony to the IRS, expressing the view that the Proposed Regulations were not consistent with the statute and its legislative history.  The Partnership’s views were consistent with those of a number of other commentators, including the tax section of the American Bar Association and the Master Limited Partnership Association. 
On January 19, 2017, the Treasury Department and the IRS released the Final Regulations on the treatment of income from natural resource activities of publicly traded partnerships as qualifying income for purposes of the Code.  The Final Regulations were published in the Federal Register on January 24, 2017, and apply to taxable years beginning after January 19, 2017.  Under the Final Regulations, the Partnership’s cokemaking operations have been excluded from the definition of activities that generate qualifying income.
The Final Regulations provide that if a partnership’s income from non-qualifying operations “was qualifying income under the statute as reasonably interpreted,” then that partnership will have a transition period ending on the last day of the partnership’s taxable year that included the date that is ten years after the date the final regulations are published in the Federal Register (i.e., December 31, 2027), during which it can treat income from such activities as qualifying income. After conferring 
12

with outside counsel, the Partnership and we are of the view that its interpretation was reasonable in concluding that the Partnership’s income from cokemaking was qualifying income, and that the Partnership will benefit from the ten-year transition period. Subsequent to the transition period, certain cokemaking entities in the Partnership will become taxable as corporations. The Partnership is evaluating its options for engaging with the appropriate parties to address its concerns with the scope of these final regulations. Also see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors."
