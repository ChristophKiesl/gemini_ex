Item 1.    Business
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "WPG," "the Company," "we," "us" or "our" refer to Washington Prime Group® Inc. ("WPG Inc."), Washington Prime Group, L.P. ("WPG L.P.") and entities in which WPG Inc. or WPG L.P. (or any affiliate) has a material ownership or financial interest, on a consolidated basis.
General
WPG Inc. is an Indiana corporation that operates as a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). WPG Inc. will generally qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes as long as it continues to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, exclusive of net capital gains, and satisfy certain other requirements. WPG Inc. will generally be allowed a deduction against its U.S. federal income tax liability for dividends paid by it to REIT shareholders, thereby reducing or eliminating any corporate level taxation to WPG Inc. WPG L.P. is WPG Inc.'s majority-owned limited partnership subsidiary that owns, develops, and manages, through its affiliates, all of WPG Inc.'s real estate properties and other assets. WPG Inc. is the sole general partner of WPG L.P. We own, develop and manage enclosed retail properties and open air properties. As of December 31, 2020, our assets consisted of material interests in 101 shopping centers in the United States, comprised of approximately 53 million square feet of managed gross leasable area ("GLA").
On December 17, 2020, the Company's common shareholders approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation that effectuated a reverse-stock split (the "Split"). See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K for additional details.
For a description of our other operational strategies and developments in our business during 2020 see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Form 10-K.
Recent Developments
Restructuring & Going Concern
The Company has engaged in discussions with certain holders of the Company’s Senior Notes due 2024 (the "Senior Notes") and certain other stakeholders with respect to potential deleveraging or restructuring transactions. These discussions have included negotiations of the terms and conditions of a financial restructuring (the "Restructuring") of the existing debt of, existing equity interests in, and certain other obligations of the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (the "Company Parties"). The Restructuring may need to be implemented pursuant to a plan of reorganization (a "Plan") to be filed in cases commenced under chapter 11 ("Chapter 11 Cases") of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"). Although the Company continues to be open to all discussions with the holders of the Senior Notes and its other stakeholders regarding a potential Restructuring, there can be no assurance we will reach an agreement regarding a Restructuring in a timely manner, on terms that are attractive to us, or at all. The Company expects to continue to provide quality service to its customers without interruption and work with its business partners as usual during the course of these discussions and any potential transaction.
On February 15, 2021, we deferred the approximately $23.2 million semi-annual interest payment due on the Senior Notes and commenced a 30-day grace period under the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We elected to enter into the grace period in order to collaborate with our stakeholders regarding the Restructuring. The Company does not expect to make the interest payment on the last day of such grace period. The failure to make the interest payment will result in an event of default on March 17, 2021 under the indenture governing the Senior Notes, which will result in a cross default under the credit agreements governing our credit facilities. On March 16, 2021, we entered into forbearance agreements (the "Forbearance Agreements") with certain holders of our Senior Notes and the administrative agents of our corporate credit facilities, on behalf of the lenders under such facilities, pursuant to which, among other things, the forbearing parties agreed not to exercise any rights and remedies available to them under the indenture governing the Senior Notes or applicable credit agreement, as applicable, related to the missed interest payment or certain other defaults (in the case of the credit agreements) until the earlier of March 31, 2021 and the occurrence of any of the early termination events specified in the agreements (the "Forbearance Periods"). There are no assurances that we will be able to extend the Forbearance Periods or that our lenders or noteholders will not accelerate our indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Notes or our credit facilities after the expiration of the Forbearance Periods.
Our intentions are to consummate the Restructuring and to generate sufficient liquidity from the Restructuring to meet our obligations and operating needs. These factors, among others, create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Liquidity and Financing Activity,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments” and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Restructuring and the risks related thereto. Refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments” and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and Note 6 for further detail of our debt obligations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.
COVID-19 Impact
During March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19"). The pandemic has significantly impacted the economic conditions in the United States, with accelerated effects since March 2020 as federal, state and local governments react to the public health crisis, creating significant uncertainties in the United States economy and infrastructure. While certain of our shopping centers were impacted by jurisdictional closures or capacity limitations during the second quarter of 2020, all of our shopping centers were open as of December 31, 2020, albeit subject to certain applicable operational limitations and restrictions. In response to these closures and capacity limitations, we granted rent relief to certain of our tenants through a combination of rent deferrals and rent abatements, which have resulted in a reduction to our fiscal year 2020 rental income by approximately $24.1 million due to the rent abatements, with additional impact to our fiscal year 2020 operating cash flows due to the rent deferrals. Additionally, as part of our continual assessment of the future collectibility of rents, we recorded an adjustment to rental income of approximately $52.4 million, including the change in estimate of collectibility of accrued (straight-line) rent. The COVID-19 global pandemic also resulted in the Company taking cost saving and capital preservation steps during 2020. For a complete list of these steps, see Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K.
Segments
Our primary business is the ownership, development and management of retail real estate within the United States. We have aggregated our operations, including enclosed retail properties and open air properties, into one reportable segment because they have similar economic characteristics and we provide similar products and services to similar types of tenants and, in many cases, the same tenants. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Signet Jewelers, Ltd. (based on common parent ownership of tenants including, but not limited to, Body by Pagoda, Jared's, Kay Jewelers, Piercing Pagoda, and Zales Jewelers) accounted for approximately 2.7% of our base minimum rents. Further, Signet Jewelers, Ltd., Dick's Sporting Goods (based on common parent ownership including Dick's Sporting Goods, Field & Stream, and Golf Galaxy) and Footlocker, Inc. (based on common parent ownership including Champs Sports, Foot Action USA, Footlocker, Kids Footlocker, and Lady Footlocker), in aggregate, comprised approximately 6.8% of our base minimum rents. Additionally, at this time, we have eight retail companies on our high risk credit watch list, representing 59 stores and approximately 4% of our total rents. See Item 2. "Properties" for further information on tenant mix.

Other Policies
The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflicts of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote.
Investment Policies
We are in the business of owning, managing, developing, and operating enclosed and open air retail properties across the United States and while we emphasize these real estate investments, we may also invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification of WPG Inc. under federal tax laws as well as our own internal policies concerning conflicts of interest and related party transactions. These REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75% of our total assets. We must also derive at least 75% of our gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents from real property," dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. In addition, we must also derive at least 95% of our gross income from such real property investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.
Subject to REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.
Financing Policies
Because WPG Inc.'s REIT qualification requires it to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income, exclusive of net capital gains, we may from time to time access the capital markets to raise the funds necessary to finance operations, acquisitions, strategic investments, development and redevelopment opportunities, and to refinance maturing debt. We must comply with customary covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value, as defined in such agreements. For example, WPG L.P.'s current line of credit and term loans contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of WPG L.P. to 60% of total assets, as defined under the related agreements, and secured debt to 40% of total assets, with slight easing of restrictions during the four trailing quarters following a portfolio acquisition. In addition, these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and debt securities of WPG L.P.
If WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital by offering equity or debt securities, creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties, entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects, or a combination of these methods. If the Board of Directors determines to raise equity capital, it may, without shareholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock. Such 
securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock, which may be convertible into common stock. Existing shareholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of WPG Inc.'s securities. Any such offering could dilute a shareholder's investment in WPG Inc.
We expect most future borrowings would be made through WPG L.P. or its subsidiaries. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured. Any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be cross-collateralized with other debt, or may be fully or partially guaranteed by WPG L.P. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so. See "Financing and Debt" within Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Form 10-K for a discussion of our debt arrangements as of December 31, 2020.
We could potentially issue additional debt securities through WPG L.P., and we may issue such debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables.
We may also finance acquisitions through the issuance of common shares or preferred shares, the issuance of additional units of partnership interest in WPG L.P., the issuance of preferred units of WPG L.P., the issuance of other securities including unsecured notes and mortgage debt, or sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties, including through the formation of joint venture agreements or other arrangements.
WPG L.P. may also issue units to transferors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the transferor to defer gain recognition for tax purposes.
We do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing instruments, however, usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties. Additionally, credit facilities, unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on the amount of secured indebtedness we may incur.
Typically, we will invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property, or on a group of properties, and will generally require us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party, as a joint venture with a third party, or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we may create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities, which are common in the real estate industry, are structured with the intention of not being consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company. We will decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we will include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness.
Conflicts of Interest Policies
We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted governance principles governing our affairs and those of the Board of Directors.
Under WPG Inc.’s Governance Principles, directors must disclose to the rest of the Board of Directors any potential conflict of interest they may have with respect to any matter under discussion and, if appropriate, recuse themselves from Board of Director discussions of, and/or refrain from voting on, such matter. Directors shall not have a duty to communicate or present any corporate opportunity to WPG Inc. and WPG Inc. renounces any interest or expectancy in such opportunity and waives any claim against a director arising from the fact that he or she does not present the opportunity to WPG Inc. or pursues or facilitates the pursuit of the opportunity by others; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply in a case in which a director is presented with a corporate opportunity in writing expressly in his or her capacity as a director of WPG Inc. The same requirement applies to officers of WPG Inc.
In addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of our officers, directors, and employees. At least a majority of the members of WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors, Governance and Nominating Committee, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee must qualify as independent under the listing standards for New York Stock Exchange listed companies. Any transaction between us and any officer, WPG Inc. director or any family member of any of the foregoing persons, or 5% shareholder of WPG Inc. must be approved or ratified pursuant to our related party transaction policy.
Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities
We intend to make investments which are consistent with WPG Inc.'s qualification as a REIT, unless the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in WPG Inc.'s best interests to so qualify as a REIT. The Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements. Subject to the approval of our Board of Directors, the REIT requirements permit us to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. Additionally, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors, the REIT requirements permit us to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may issue shares of our common stock, or cash at our option, to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnership agreement. Our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose. We may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate. Additionally, we may make or buy interests in loans for real estate properties owned by others.
Competition
The retail real estate industry is dynamic and competitive. We compete with other public and private real estate companies, including those that manage and own malls, power centers, strip centers, lifestyle centers, outlet centers, and community centers, as well as other commercial real estate developers and real estate owners, particularly those with properties near our properties, on the basis of several factors including quality, design, and location as well as rental rates. We also compete with these companies to attract customers to our properties by attracting and retaining a diverse mix of anchor, in-line and other tenants. We believe these tenants consider all of the aforementioned factors as well as consumer demographics and management and operational expertise when making their leasing decisions.
In addition, because our revenue potential is linked to the success of our retailers, we indirectly share exposure to the same competitive factors and market forces that our retail tenants experience in their respective markets when trying to attract individual shoppers. These dynamics include general competition from other retail properties and retailers, as well as competition from an increasing variety of different retail formats, including internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution options beyond brick and mortar retail stores. The existence of these competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease, develop and redevelop traditional commercial retail space and on the level of rents we can obtain.
Seasonality
The shopping center business is, to some extent, seasonal in nature with tenants typically achieving the highest levels of sales during our fiscal fourth quarter due to the holiday season, which generally results in higher percentage rent income in the fourth quarter. Additionally, enclosed retail properties achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season, with such tenants vacating early in the subsequent year. Thus, occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of our fiscal year.
Environmental Matters
We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations.
Intellectual Property
WPG L.P., by and through its affiliates, holds service marks registered with the United States ("U.S.") Patent and Trademark Office, including the terms Washington Prime Group® (expiration date January 2028), The Outlet Collection® (expiration date October 2023), Shelby’s Sugar Shop® (expiration date September 2028), and TANGIBLE® (expiration date September 2028) as well as the names of certain of our properties such as Scottsdale Quarter® (expiration date November 2029), Town Center at Aurora® (expiration date October 2026), and Polaris Fashion Place® (expiration date July 2022), and other marketing terms, phrases, and materials we use to promote our business, services, and properties. Additionally, WPG L.P. holds U.S. Patent No. 10,540,702 issued on January 21, 2020 and expiring September 19, 2037, which is used as part of the TANGIBLE technology.
Sustainability
ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance)
We know that ESG practices, otherwise known as sustainability, are important to our stakeholders, and they are important to the Company as we believe incorporating sustainable practices into our business model will add long term value to our portfolio of shopping centers and retail town centers. Sustainability is a strong commitment to the communities where we operate that allows us to embrace opportunities to improve the lives of our colleagues, guests, and the environment. Sustainability comes to life in the ways we manage and redevelop our retail town centers, provide dynamic experiences for our guests, conduct business with our partners, engage with our communities and create a productive and positive work environment for our colleagues.
The Board of Directors’ Sustainability Committee, as well as our internal, interdisciplinary ESG Executive Steering Committee and ESG Task Force, work together to make continuous enterprise-wide progress on our ESG objectives. While 2020 has provided for challenges due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company executed the following key achievements:

•Launched an ESG microsite (www.washingtonprime.com/esg);
•Navigated the complex process of reopening our properties and staying open during the COVID-19 pandemic, prioritizing the safety of our guests, tenants and colleagues; in accordance with Centers for Disease Control ("CDC") guidelines, interior high touchpoint areas are frequently disinfected using EPA-approved sanitation chemicals and efforts allow for enhanced workspace cleaning; through on-site signage, digital communications, and active and ongoing encouragement by property security teams, we established our COVID-19 Code of Conduct and continue to remind our guests to self-screen before visiting our shopping centers and retail town centers, wear CDC-recommended facial coverings, and maintain six feet of distance;
•Established our WPG Cares initiative, where local management teams embrace their roles as community ambassadors and work with local organizations to transform our retail town centers into spaces for social good, completing over 1,000 community goodwill efforts, including serving as distribution centers for personal protective equipment and medical supplies, hosting COVID-19 testing sites, providing space for food drives and meal distribution services, hosting blood drives, providing a socially distant location for voter registration, serving as COVID-19 vaccination sites and much more;
•Established our Open for Small Business initiative, in conjunction with the Institute for Justice Clinic on Entrepreneurship and members of the University of Chicago faculty, to address some of the most pressing needs of small businesses as they navigate the COVID-19 global pandemic, including through the development of a standardized lease modification template;

•Established Retail To-Go to enable our tenants to continue doing business and stay connected with guests during the COVID-19 pandemic; we continue to support our retailers, restaurants and guests through Retail To-Go, where shoppers can make an order at participating businesses and then arrange for pick up at designated curbside locations; Retail To-Go continues to provide a contactless and convenient way for guests to shop at our shopping centers and retail town centers;
•Developed Well Picked Goods, a weekly digital curation of products from tenants at a particular retail town center, to maintain guest loyalty and incent a return to our retail town centers following COVID-19 temporary retail closures as selected by the property’s general manager; through Well Picked Goods, guests who purchased products from the curated list were eligible to receive a gift card once the retail town center reopened;
•Supported community-centric brands and provided support to small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic through Tangible™ Collective, an innovative concept which brings together the best of brick-and-mortar and e-commerce and offers guests the opportunity to try unique, online-only products in a physical space;

Risks Related to Liquidity and Financing Activity
We did not make the interest payment on the Senior Notes due on February 15, 2021, which is expected to result in an event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes and a cross-default under certain of our other indebtedness. These factors, among others, create substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
We had an interest payment of approximately $23.2 million due on February 15, 2021 to holders of the Senior Notes, which we did not pay as we continue discussions with noteholders, lenders under our credit agreements and other holders of our debt in order to find alternatives to improve our long-term capital structure. The missed interest payment will result in an event of default on March 17, 2021 under the indenture governing the Senior Notes. Upon the missed interest payment becoming an event of default, the trustee for the Senior Notes or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Senior Notes may declare the principal and any interest immediately due and payable. An event of default under the Senior Notes indenture will result in a cross default under the agreements governing certain of our other indebtedness, including credit agreements governing our corporate credit facilities. Upon an event of default under the credit agreements governing our corporate credit facilities, our loans thereunder will bear interest at the default rate. While we have entered into Forbearance Agreements with respect to the defaults under the indenture and corporate credit agreements, there can be no assurances that we will be able to extend the Forbearance Periods thereunder or that our lenders or noteholders will not accelerate our indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Notes or our credit facilities after the expiration of the Forbearance Periods. If we are not successful in refinancing or restructuring our debt, or accessing additional liquidity, we will not be able to fund all our commitments to the holders of our indebtedness, including the holders of the Senior Notes and the lenders under the credit agreements. Although we are in active discussions with representatives of our lenders and holders of the Senior Notes regarding alternatives to restructure our capital structure, we can provide no assurance that such restructuring will be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. These factors, among others, create substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
There is no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement in principle with our noteholders and/or lenders regarding a potential Restructuring, comply with the terms thereof or consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
The Company is engaged in discussions with its noteholders and lenders with respect to potential deleveraging or restructuring transactions. These discussions have included negotiations of the terms and conditions of the Restructuring of the existing debt of, existing equity interests in, and certain other obligations of the Company Parties, expected to be set forth in a non-binding restructuring term sheet (the "Restructuring Term Sheet") and ultimately documented in a binding restructuring support agreement (the "Restructuring Support Agreement"). We have not yet reached an agreement on mutually acceptable terms and conditions with our noteholders and lenders regarding a possible transaction. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement-in-principle with respect to a Restructuring Term Sheet or successfully negotiate or enter into a Restructuring Support Agreement on the terms set forth in a Restructuring Term Sheet, or at all.
Our intentions are to consummate the Restructuring and to generate sufficient liquidity from the Restructuring to meet our obligations and operating needs. If the Company enters into a Restructuring Term Sheet and a Restructuring Support Agreement, we expect there will be certain material conditions that we must satisfy, including the timely satisfaction of specified milestones related to the solicitation of votes to approve a Plan, commencement of Chapter 11 Cases under the 
Bankruptcy Code, confirmation of the Plan, consummation of the Plan, and the entry of orders relating to any debtor-in-possession facility ("DIP Facility"). Our ability to timely complete such milestones required to consummate the Restructuring is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control. These factors, together with the Company's limited liquidity, recurring losses from operations and accumulated deficit, create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate the Restructuring on the terms set forth in any Restructuring Term Sheet or Restructuring Support Agreement, or at all, or realize all or any of the expected benefits from the Restructuring.
We may seek the protection of the bankruptcy court, which would subject us to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy and may harm our business and place our equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their investment in the Company.
If we seek the protection of the bankruptcy court, our operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan, and our ability to continue as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. As such, seeking bankruptcy court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. During any Chapter 11 Cases, our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort attending to the Restructuring instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. bankruptcy court protection also might make it more difficult to retain management and other employees necessary to the success and growth of our business.
Other significant risks include the following:
•our ability to prosecute, confirm and consummate a Plan;
•the high costs of bankruptcy and related fees;
•the imposition of restrictions or obligations on the Company by regulators related to the bankruptcy;
•our ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence;
•our ability to maintain our relationships with our tenants, service providers, customers employees, and other third parties;
•our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations; and
•the actions and decisions of our debtholders and other third parties who have interests in our chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our plans.
Delays in Chapter 11 Cases increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.
Although we expect the confirmation of a Plan will be implemented through an orderly plan of reorganization, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement such a Plan. In order for any proposed plan of reorganization to be confirmed, the Bankruptcy Code, in addition to other legal requirements, requires that at least one impaired class of claims votes to accept the plan of reorganization. In order for a class of creditors to approve a plan of reorganization, the plan must be approved by more than one-half of the total number of claim holders and at least two-thirds in claim amount by those who vote within the class. In addition to obtaining the required votes, the requirements for a bankruptcy court to approve a plan of reorganization include, among other judicial findings, that:
•we acted in accordance with the applicable provisions in the Bankruptcy Code; and
•the plan of reorganization has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.
In the event there are any impaired classes of claims that do not vote to accept the plan of reorganization, we would have to satisfy the “cram down” requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and show that the plan of reorganization does not unfairly discriminate and is fair and equitable with respect to those classes of claims that did not vote to accept the plan of reorganization.
Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain approval of a disclosure statement and/or the required votes or the required judicial approval to a Plan promptly, if at all. In such event, a prolonged bankruptcy proceeding could adversely affect our relationships with tenants, suppliers, regulators and employees, among other parties, which in turn could adversely affect our business, competitive position, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern. A weakening of our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could adversely affect our ability to implement a Plan. In addition, if a Plan is not confirmed by the bankruptcy court, we may be forced to liquidate our assets.
If we pursue any Chapter 11 Cases, it is also possible that the bankruptcy court may dismiss the proceeding or otherwise decide to abstain from hearing it on procedural grounds. In addition, the confirmation and effectiveness of a Plan is subject to 
certain conditions and requirements in addition to those described above that may not be satisfied, and the Bankruptcy Court may conclude that the requirements for confirmation and effectiveness have not been satisfied.
If we are unable to enter into a Restructuring Support Agreement or if a Restructuring Support Agreement is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate a Plan may be materially and adversely affected.
Even if we are able to reach an agreement-in-principle with respect to a Restructuring Term Sheet, the final terms of the Restructuring Term Sheet would remain subject to documentation in a binding Restructuring Support Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate or enter into a Restructuring Support Agreement on the terms set forth in a Restructuring Term Sheet or at all. If we are unable to enter into a Restructuring Support Agreement, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully negotiate for an alternative orderly pre-negotiated plan of reorganization.
Our limited liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations.
We require certain capital resources in order to operate our business and our limited liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations. We are highly leveraged, and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs will arise from debt service on our outstanding indebtedness and from funding the costs of operations, working capital and capital expenditures. Our $650 million revolving credit facility has $3 million of credit available as of December 31, 2020. Our access to capital and debt markets is significantly limited. A number of factors, including but not limited to, decreased revenues related to decreased traffic and spending amounts of our tenants and customers, and the impact of economic conditions may negatively affect our cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $0.3 billion and approximately $1.2 billion of consolidated long-term debt maturing in 2021 and 2022, respectively, excluding interest obligations. In connection with the Restructuring, we expect to enter into a DIP Facility. While we anticipate being able to obtain a DIP Facility, there can be no assurance we can enter into such a facility of the expected terms or at all (with any such facility being subject to approval by the bankruptcy court), nor any assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity from any DIP Facility and other future indebtedness to fund our operations and consummate the Restructuring.
See “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments” and “- (b) Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information on the Restructuring and our liquidity. Refer to Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our debt obligations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that might affect our or their ability to operate.
We have a variety of debt, including the Senior Notes, our corporate credit facilities and secured property-level debt. The agreements that govern such indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that could, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on property, incur additional indebtedness, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, and/or merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell or convey certain assets to any one person or entity. Additionally, some of the agreements that govern the debt financing contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios. Our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations.
In connection with the acceleration of our repayment obligations due to an event of default related to the uncured violation of one or more of our debt covenants, if we fail to make any required repayments with respect of our debt, then (i) we will be in default thereunder and, as a result, the related debt holders and lenders, and potentially other debt holders and lenders, could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, (ii) the lenders under such loans, including, but not limited to the Revolver, could terminate their commitments to loan money to us, (iii) our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing the related debt, (iv) could result in cross defaults on other financing obligations or defaults in other transactional arrangements we have; and (v) we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
As discussed previously, on February 15, 2021, we elected not to make the interest payment on our Senior Notes, which is will result in an event of default on March 17, 2021 under the indenture governing the Senior Notes and a cross-default under the agreements governing certain of our other indebtedness, including the credit agreements governing our corporate credit facilities. While we have entered into the Forbearance Agreements with respect to such defaults, there can be no assurances that we will be able to extend the Forbearance Periods thereunder or that our lenders or noteholders will not accelerate our indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Notes or our credit facilities after the expiration of the Forbearance Periods.
An increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on existing and future debt.
An environment of rising interest rates could result in increased borrowing costs for us, which may adversely affect our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to our shareholders.
We have significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, including decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense.
The consolidated indebtedness of our business as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $3.2 billion. We have and will continue to incur various costs and expenses associated with our transactions and executing our operational and fiscal strategy. Any future increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce access to capital and increase borrowing costs generally, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, tenant improvements, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve our operational and growth goals or if the financial performance of the Company does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted. Lastly, if interest rates increase, the cost of capital and expenses of debt service requirements relating to our variable rate debt, which constitutes 24.7% of our consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2020, would increase which could adversely affect our cash flows.
We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method in which LIBOR is determined.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $812.0 million (excluding net debt issuance costs of $15.5 million) of our aggregate consolidated indebtedness that was indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $640.3 million of consolidated indebtedness swapped to LIBOR plus a fixed spread. Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR based on observable market transactions. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it has commitments from panel banks to continue to contribute to LIBOR through the end of 2021, but that it will not use its powers to compel contributions beyond such date. Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of such rates beyond 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and various other authorities have commenced the publication of reforms and actions relating to alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR. Although the full impact of such reforms and actions, together with any transition away from LIBOR, including the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR publication, remains unclear, these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing, including LIBOR-based loans, and on our financing costs.
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service and repay all of our debt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.
Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt will depend on our financial condition, liquidity and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us both to fund our business purposes and to pay the principal of, or premium, if any, and interest on our debt.
If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service and repay our debt and fund other cash requirements, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet all of our debt obligations. Our revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") and senior term loan (the "Term Loan" and collectively with the Revolver, the "Facility") restrict (i) our ability to dispose of assets and (ii) our ability to incur debt. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt obligations then due.
In addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make cash available to us to enable us to make payments in respect of our debt. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual prohibitions or other restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that our subsidiaries do not make sufficient cash available to us, we may be unable to make required principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on our debt.
Our inability to obtain sufficient cash flows from our subsidiaries, whether as a result of their performance or otherwise, to satisfy our debt, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position, condition, liquidity and results of operations.
If we fail to make required payments in respect of our debt, (i) we will be in default thereunder and, as a result, the related debt holders and lenders, and potentially other debt holders and lenders, could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, (ii) the lenders under the Revolver could terminate their commitments to loan money to us, (iii) our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing the related debt, (iv) could result in cross defaults on other financing obligations or defaults in other transactional arrangements we have; and (v) we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
The continuing spread of COVID-19 (including notable and severe mutations of the virus) may have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and, under certain circumstances, remain a going concern.
As a result of the related events due to the COVID-19 pandemic (including notable and severe mutations of the virus), we have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, a material adverse effect on our income and expenses. COVID-19’s impact on our income and expenses has also impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. While we have received certain covenant relief through the third quarter of 2021 related to the Revolver, with the continued uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse fiscal impact, significant risks remain with respect to our ability to comply with such financial covenants going forward, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through March 16, 2022.
Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 global pandemic has caused a significant disruption in non-essential retail commerce and may have a material adverse impact upon the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
During March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of COVID-19. The pandemic has significantly impacted the economic conditions in the United States, with accelerated effects since March 2020, as federal, state and local governments react to the public health crisis, creating significant uncertainties in the United States economy. During our second 2020 fiscal quarter and intermittently throughout the rest of 2020, in the interest of public health and safety, jurisdictions (national, state and local) where our shopping centers are located, required mandatory closures, capacity limitations or other restrictions for those that continue to operate which impacted our tenants' ability to operate as well as pay rent and other related lease charges or otherwise fulfill the obligations of their respective leases. As a result of these developments, a material adverse impact on the Company revenues, results of operations and cash flows for the year ending December 31, 2020 occurred and may continue despite the fact that as of the filing date of this Form 10-K, the majority of our enclosed retail properties were open in some capacity and our open air properties operated throughout much of the period of mandatory closures to extent permitted by applicable law. However, this situation is ever evolving and additional impacts to the business may arise of which we are not currently aware. We cannot predict whether, when or the manner in which the conditions surrounding COVID-19 will change including the timing of lifting any restrictions or relaxation of closure requirements, when our enclosed shopping centers and tenants will reopen at full capacity, and when shoppers will fully re-engage with our brand.
 In addition to the impacts and uncertainties listed above, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused the Company to significantly modify and alter the working environment and practices of its employees at its corporate offices and properties which could adversely impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the Company’s personnel in managing and operating its properties as well as completing other operating and administrative functions that are important to its business. Continued efforts by large numbers of the Company’s employees to work extensively and, in some cases, exclusive remotely could also expose the Company to additional risks, such as increased cybersecurity risk.
Our revenues are dependent on the level of revenues realized by our tenants, and a decline in their revenues could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to various risks that affect the retail environment generally, including levels of consumer spending, seasonality, changes in economic conditions, unemployment rates, an increase in the use of the Internet by retailers and consumers, and natural disasters. Levels of consumer spending could be adversely affected by, for example, increases in consumer savings rates, increases in tax rates, reduced levels of income, interest rate increases, other declines in consumer net worth, unemployment levels, and a strengthening of the U.S. dollar as compared to non-U.S. currencies.
The existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation efforts have resulted in travel restrictions and plant shutdowns, all of which have impacted, and could continue to impact, our tenants’ supply chains and, ultimately, retail product availability. State and local stay at home orders, occupancy restrictions, masking/face covering requirements and social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak have impacted and continue to impact customer traffic at our properties. Even though such orders have been lifted or relaxed in some places, customer traffic may continue to be adversely impacted, which could adversely impact sales for some of our tenants, which in turn could negatively impact our fiscal results and operations. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in property shutdowns, and may result in additional shutdowns of our retail properties, particularly in certain geographies reporting increasing diagnoses of the virus or related 
illnesses. The extent of the outbreak and its impact on our tenants and our operations is uncertain, but a prolonged outbreak as well as related mitigation efforts could continue to have a material impact on our revenues and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
As a result of these and other economic and market-based factors, our tenants might be unable to pay their existing minimum rents or pay landlord recovery charges. Because substantially all of our income is derived from rentals of commercial real property, our income and cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of tenants are unable to meet their obligations or their revenues decline, especially if they were tenants with a significant number of locations within our portfolio. Some of our tenants have not re-opened after the closure restrictions were lifted and operating limitations eased, which will likely have a material impact on occupancy at our properties which could result in an increase in the number of co-tenancy claims because required occupancy thresholds were not satisfied. Additionally, a further or continued decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates.
Many of the Company’s properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and drive customer traffic and the existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation efforts could adversely impact in a material way the viability of a respective center or property as well as its tenants.
Our open air properties and enclosed retail properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally or regionally recognized tenants. The existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation efforts may result in department store or major tenant closing or reducing operations for a significant period of time which might result in decreased customer traffic, which could lead to decreased sales at our properties and adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our leasing strategy and operational objectives. Department store or major tenants may seek, and have sought, concessions from us for paying lease charges as a result of such mandatory closures or reduced hours. There are no assurances that customer traffic will return as high as pre-COVID-19 rates which could adversely impact sales for some of our tenants, which in turn could negatively impact our fiscal results and operations.
If the sales of stores operating in our properties decline significantly due to the closing or limited operation of anchor stores or other national retailers because of the existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation efforts, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges, which would likely negatively impact our financial results.
The existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation efforts may adversely impact the Company’s ability to successfully and timely complete its various redevelopment projects as budgeted.
The existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic may cause, as a result of governmental imposed closures or work stoppages, interrupted supply chains, reduced personnel due to closures or illnesses, unforeseen delays in the planning, execution and completion of construction projects associated with our redevelopment plans. Additionally, related permitting, inspections and reviews by jurisdictional planning commissions and authorities is also likely to be delayed or postponed which will materially impact the timeline and budgets for completing such projects. 
As a result of such conditions and other factors, projects in our redevelopment pipeline may not be pursued or may be completed later or with higher costs than anticipated. In the event of an unsuccessful or delayed redevelopment project, our loss could exceed our investment in the project. Redevelopment activities involve significant risks, including: the expenditure of funds on and devotion of time to projects which may not come to fruition; increased construction costs that may make the project economically unattractive; an inability to obtain construction financing and permanent financing on favorable terms; and occupancy rates and rents not sufficient to make a project profitable.
The existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation efforts may result in increased and more frequent bankruptcy filings of a number of our tenants or downturns in our tenants’ businesses that may reduce our cash flow.
Because the Company derives almost all of our income from rental payments and other tenant charges, our cash available for distribution and operations would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us, or if we were unable to lease vacant space in our properties on economically favorable terms. One or more of our tenants may seek the protection of the federal bankruptcy laws, or similar proceedings on the state level or in a foreign jurisdiction, as a result of the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which could result in the termination of its lease causing a reduction in our cash available for distribution. Furthermore, certain of our tenants, including anchor tenants, hold the right under their lease(s) to terminate their lease(s) or reduce their rental rate if certain occupancy conditions are not met, if certain anchor tenants close, if certain sales levels or profit margins are not achieved, or if an exclusive use provision is violated, which all could be triggered in the event of one or more tenant bankruptcies. A significant increase in the number of tenant bankruptcies, particularly amongst anchor tenants, may make it more difficult for us to lease the remainder of the property or properties in which the bankrupt tenant operates and adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy.
The existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation efforts may result in increased and more substantial impairment charges that may materially affect our financial results.
We evaluate our real estate assets and other assets for impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of our investment in the asset is not reasonably assured. Furthermore, this evaluation is conducted no less frequently than quarterly, irrespective of changes in circumstances. Our determination of whether a particular held-for-use asset is impaired is based upon the undiscounted projected cash flows used for the impairment analysis and our determination of the asset's estimated fair value, that in turn are based upon our plans for the respective asset and our views of market and economic conditions. With respect to assets held-for-sale, our determination of whether such an asset is impaired is based upon market and economic conditions. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, then we would be required under GAAP to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the accounting period in which the adjustment is made. Furthermore, changes in estimated future cash flows due to a change in our plans, policies, or views of market and economic conditions could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses for already impaired assets, which, under the applicable accounting guidance, could be substantial.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the sustained closure of our centers as well as the cessation of the operations of certain of our tenants which caused a reduction in our revenues due to the impaired financial stability of our tenants and ultimately our cash flows for many of our centers as well as other sources of income generated by our properties. In addition to reduced revenues generated by our centers as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, our ability to obtain sufficient financing in the future for such properties may be impaired as well as our ability in the future to lease or re-lease centers as a result of worsening market and economic conditions produced by the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The worsening of estimated future cash flows due to a change in our plans, policies, or views of market and economic conditions as it relates to one or more of our properties adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak as well as its persistence could result in the recognition of substantial impairment charges imposed on our assets which could adversely impact our financial results.
The existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation efforts may promote prolonged instability or volatility in the U.S. economy that may adversely impact consumer spending and therefore our operating results.
A sustained downturn in the U.S. economy and reduced consumer spending as well as consumer activity at brick-and-mortar commercial establishments due to the prolonged existence, persistence and threat of the COVID-19 pandemic could impose a prolonged economic recession in the U.S. which could impact our tenants’ ability to meet their lease obligations due to poor operating results, lack of liquidity or other reasons and therefore decrease the revenue generated by our properties or the value of our properties. Our ability to lease space and negotiate and maintain favorable rents could also be negatively impacted by a prolonged recession in the U.S. economy. Moreover, the demand for leasing space in our existing shopping centers as well as our redevelopment properties could also substantially decline during a significant downturn in the U.S. economy which could result in a decline in our occupancy percentage and reduction in rental revenues. 
The existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in further significant reduction of our workforce due to continued mitigation efforts, medically related absences or quarantines.
The Company’s workforce is maintained at two corporate offices and at certain of its shopping centers. Reductions in personnel either due to budgetary reasons or further mitigation efforts in response to the existence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic would hamper the Company’s ability to effectively achieve its fiscal, operational, and strategic objectives. Certain of the Company’s personnel, including its executive officers, have substantial experience in owning, operating, managing, acquiring and developing shopping centers. The Company’s success depends in large part upon the efforts of these executives and other personnel, and we cannot guarantee that they will remain with us throughout this pandemic. The Company already reduced approximately 20% of its workforce for budgetary reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic and, although some personnel have since been rehired, the loss of key management personnel in leasing, finance, legal, construction, development, or operations could have a negative impact on the Company’s operations. In addition, except for isolated examples amongst our senior executive personnel, there are generally no restrictions on the ability of terminated personnel to compete with us after the termination of their employment.
The continuing spread of COVID-19 may have a material adverse effect on our ability to make distributions to our common shareholders.
The prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and world economies is uncertain and could result in a prolonged world-wide economic downturn that may lead to corporate bankruptcies in the most affected industries and an increase in unemployment. As a result of the real estate assets in our real estate portfolio being comprised entirely of retail properties located in the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our tenants’ ability to pay rent, and therefore impact the income received by us, to the extent that its continued spread within the United States reduces occupancy, decreases customer traffic or results in quarantines where our properties are located, increases the cost of operation, results in reduced hours or necessitates the further closure or re-closure of our properties. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain 
owners of shopping center properties located in the United States have announced temporary closures of such properties and even re-closures of properties as a result of the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic. During a portion of our second 2020 fiscal quarter, our enclosed shopping centers were required to close and, upon reopening, then operated at reduced hours and enforced occupancy restrictions which materially impacted our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, customer traffic at our properties has been reduced because of COVID-19 related concerns.
As a result of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s fiscal condition and in an effort to preserve its cash position, the Company announced in April 2020 the temporary suspension of its quarterly common share and operating partnership unit cash dividend for the remainder of 2020. This suspension continues as of the filing date of this Form 10-K. The extent to which COVID-19 further impacts our income, our expenses and ability to pay distributions to our common shareholders and unitholders of WPG’s affiliate will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer acceptance of the safety of retail center shopping and the actions taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others.
Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
We might not be able to renew leases or relet space at existing properties, or lease newly developed properties.
When leases for our existing properties expire, the premises might not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of tenant allowances and concessions and the size of the space, might be less favorable than the current lease terms, due to strong competition or otherwise. Also, we might not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections. To the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and our operational and strategic objectives may not be achieved readily or at all.
Our lease agreements with our tenants typically provide a fixed rate for certain cost reimbursement charges; if our operating expenses increase or we are otherwise unable to collect sufficient cost reimbursement payments from our tenants, our business, results of operations and financial condition might be materially adversely affected.
Energy costs, repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to common areas of our properties, janitorial services, administrative, property and liability insurance costs and security costs are typically allocable to our properties' tenants. Our lease agreements typically provide that the tenant is liable for a portion of such common area maintenance charges (which we refer to as "CAM") and other operating expenses. The majority of our current leases require the tenant to pay a fixed periodic amount to reimburse a portion of our CAM and other operating expenses. In these cases, a tenant will pay either (a) a specified rent amount that includes the fixed CAM and operating expense reimbursement amount, or (b) a fixed expense reimbursement amount separate from the rent payment. Generally, both types of CAM and operating expense reimbursement payments are subject to annual increases regardless of the actual amount of CAM and other operating expenses. As a result, any adjustments in tenant payments do not depend on whether operating expenses increase or decrease, causing us to be responsible for any excess amounts. In the event that our operating expenses increase, CAM and tenant reimbursements that we receive might not allow us to recover a substantial portion of these operating costs.
Additionally, the computation of cost reimbursements from tenants for CAM, insurance and real estate taxes is complex and involves numerous judgments, including interpretation of lease terms and other tenant lease provisions, including those in leases that we assume in connection with property acquisitions. Unforeseen or underestimated expenses might cause us to collect less than our actual expenses. The amounts we calculate and bill could also be disputed by tenants or become the subject of a tenant audit or even litigation. There can be no assurance that we will collect all or substantially all of this amount.
Some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be materially adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these anchor stores or major tenants.
Our open air and enclosed retail properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally or regionally recognized tenants. The value of some of our properties could be adversely affected materially, if these department stores or major tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations, or cease their operations even if on a temporary basis.
For example, among department stores and other large stores, corporate merger or consolidation activity typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. Adverse economic and fiscal pressure on the businesses of our department stores and major tenants could have an adverse impact upon our own results. As they have for the past few years, certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and might continue to experience, depending on consumer confidence levels, overall economic conditions or the continued persistence of the COVID-19 global pandemic, considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options, such as those accessible via the Internet and other mediums, and other forms of pressure on their business models. Pressure on 
these department stores and national retailers could impact their ability to maintain their stores, meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers, withstand takeover attempts by investors or rivals or avoid bankruptcy and/or liquidation, all of which could result in impairment or closures of their stores. Other of our tenants might be entitled to modify the economic or other terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures (through co-tenancy clauses), which could decrease rents and/or operating expense reimbursements or entitle such retailers to close their stores. The leases of some anchors might permit the anchor to transfer its lease, including any attendant approval rights, to another retailer. The transfer to a new anchor could cause customer traffic in the property to decrease or to be composed of different types of customers, which could reduce the income generated by that property and adversely impact leasing, development or re-development prospects for such property, which could adversely impact growth projects for the property and the Company generally. A transfer of a lease to a new anchor also could allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the property, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Additionally, department store or major tenant closures might result in decreased customer traffic, which could lead to decreased sales at our properties and adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our leasing strategy and objectives. If the sales of stores operating in our properties decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers, adverse economic conditions, or other reasons, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or pay landlord recovery charges, which would likely negatively impact our financial results. In the event of any default by a tenant, whether a department store, national or regional retailer or otherwise, we might not be able to fully recover our investment and/or experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with such parties.
We face risks associated with the acquisition, development, re-development and expansion of properties, including risks of higher than projected costs, inability to obtain financing, inability to obtain required consents or approvals and inability to attract tenants at anticipated rates.
In the event we seek to acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties, we might not be successful in identifying or pursuing acquisition, development or re-development/expansion opportunities. Additionally, newly acquired properties, developed, re-developed or expanded properties might not perform as well as expected. Other related risks we face include, without limitation, the following:
•Construction and other development costs of a project could be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;
•We might not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms, if at all;
•We might be unable to obtain zoning, occupancy or other governmental approvals, or the approvals obtained may not be adequate;
•Occupancy rates and rents might not meet our projections and as a result the project could be unprofitable; and
•In some cases, we might need the consent of third parties, such as anchor tenants, mortgage lenders and joint venture partners to conduct acquisition, development, re-development or expansion activities, and those consents may be withheld, take an unexpected amount of time to be obtained, or be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
If a project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning, we could lose our investment in the project or have to incur an impairment charge relating to the asset or development which could then adversely impact our financial results. Furthermore, if we guarantee the property's financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project.
Our assets may be subject to impairment charges that may materially affect our financial results.
We evaluate our real estate assets and other assets for impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of our investment in the asset is not reasonably assured. Furthermore, this evaluation is conducted no less frequently than quarterly, irrespective of changes in circumstances. Our determination of whether a particular held-for-use asset is impaired is based upon the undiscounted projected cash flows used for the impairment analysis and our determination of the asset's estimated fair value, that in turn are based upon our plans for the respective asset and our views of market and economic conditions. With respect to assets held-for-sale, our determination of whether such an asset is impaired is based upon market and economic conditions. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, then we would be required under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the accounting period in which the adjustment is made. Furthermore, changes in estimated future cash flows due to a change in our plans, policies, or views of market and economic conditions could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses for already impaired assets, which, under the applicable accounting guidance, could be substantial. See the "Impairment" section within Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of recent impairments.
Our ability to change the composition of our real estate portfolio is limited because real estate investments are relatively illiquid.
Our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets, and these investments are relatively illiquid. As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited. If we want to sell a property, we cannot be certain that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sale price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment in that property, which may then have an adverse impact on our financial results.
Clauses in leases with certain tenants of our development or redevelopment properties may include inducements, such as reduced rent and tenant allowance payments, which can reduce our rents and Funds From Operations ("FFO"). As a result, these development or redevelopment properties are more likely to achieve lower returns during their stabilization periods than our previous development or redevelopment properties.
The leases for a number of the tenants that have opened stores at properties we have developed or redeveloped have reduced rent from co-tenancy clauses that allow those tenants to pay reduced rent until occupancy at the respective property reaches certain thresholds and/or certain named co-tenants open stores at the respective property. Additionally, some tenants may have rent abatement clauses that delay rent commencement for a prolonged period of time after initial occupancy. The effect of these clauses reduces our rents and FFO while they are applicable. We expect to continue to offer co-tenancy and rent abatement clauses in the future to attract tenants to our development and redevelopment properties. As a result, our current and future development and redevelopment properties are more likely to achieve lower returns during their stabilization periods than other projects of this nature historically have, which may adversely impact our investment in such developments, as well as our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the prevalence and volume of such properties is likely to increase in our development and redevelopment pipeline at an unpredictable rate in light of the recent proliferation of bankruptcy filings and closures by retailers occupying "big box," anchor or other traditionally large spaces which can have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably.
Our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retail, such as catalogs and e-commerce websites. Competition could also come from other open air properties, outlet centers, lifestyle centers, and enclosed retail properties, and both existing and future development projects. The presence of competitive alternatives might adversely impact the success of our existing properties, our ability to lease space and the rental rates we can obtain. We also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites. Additionally, we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified management. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
The increase in and prevalence of digital and mobile technology usage has increased the speed of the transition of a percentage of market share from shopping at physical locations to web-based purchases. If we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to changing consumer spending habits and methods by which consumers shop retail, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, our investments in ventures aimed at finding innovative and unique uses within shopping centers and retail generally may be unsuccessful and incur expenses, losses, and use resources to a degree that adversely impacts our financial results without a corresponding positive financial return or operational benefit.
If we lose our key management personnel, we might not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.
Our management team has substantial experience in owning, operating, acquiring, and developing enclosed retail properties and other open air properties. A large part of our success depends on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and we cannot guarantee that they will remain with us. If we unexpectedly lose the services of these individuals, we might not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. Additionally, we continue to actively recruit management and other professional talent within the real estate, retail industries and otherwise that are necessary to manage our properties to optimal performance. If we are not able to successfully recruit such personnel or cannot do so readily, this may adversely impact our ability to manage our business, achieve our financial goals, or meet our strategic and operational objectives.
The negotiations regarding the Restructuring have consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition.
Our management has spent, and will continue to be required to spend, a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the Restructuring. This diversion of attention may have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, and, as a result, 
on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Restructuring is protracted. During the pendency of the Restructuring, our employees will face considerable distraction and uncertainty and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet customer expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. The failure to retain or attract members of our management team and other key personnel could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, we could experience losses of tenants who may be concerned about our ongoing long-term viability.
We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which could adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance or otherwise take actions concerning these properties that would be in the best interests of WPG Inc.'s shareholders.
We may continue to co-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities, including without limitation by acquiring controlling or non-controlling interests in, or sharing responsibility for, managing the affairs of a property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. At December 31, 2020, we do not have sole decision-making authority regarding 12 unconsolidated properties that we currently hold through joint ventures with third parties.
Additionally, we might not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding any future properties that we hold in a partnership or joint venture. Investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities could, under certain circumstances, involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt, suffer a deterioration in their financial condition, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or co-venturers could have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.
Such investments also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as a sale or financing, because neither we nor our partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. Additionally, we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers.
Our revenues are dependent on the level of revenues realized by our tenants, and a decline in their revenues could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to various risks that affect the retail environment generally, including levels of consumer spending, seasonality, changes in economic conditions, unemployment rates, an increase in the use of the Internet by retailers and consumers, and natural disasters. Additionally, levels of consumer spending could be adversely affected by, for example, increases in consumer savings rates, increases in tax rates, reduced levels of income growth, interest rate increases, and other declines in consumer net worth and a strengthening of the U.S. dollar as compared to non-U.S. currencies.
As a result of these and other economic and market-based factors, our tenants might be unable to pay their existing minimum rents or pay landlord recovery charges due. Because substantially all of our income is derived from rentals of commercial real property, our income and cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of tenants are unable to meet their obligations or their revenues decline, especially if they were tenants with a significant number of locations within our portfolio. Additionally, a decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates.
Store closures and/or bankruptcy filings by tenants could occur during the course of our operations. We continually seek to re-lease vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations. Large scale store closings or the bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant, might make it more difficult to lease the remainder of a particular property or properties. Furthermore, certain of our tenants, including anchor tenants, hold the right under their lease(s) to terminate their lease(s) or reduce their rental rate if certain occupancy conditions are not met, if certain anchor tenants close, if certain sales levels (sales kick-out provisions) or profit margins are not achieved, or if an exclusive use provision is violated, which all could be triggered in the event of one or more tenant bankruptcies. Future tenant bankruptcies, especially by anchor tenants, could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy as well as adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and strategic objectives.
Economic and market conditions could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The market in which we operate is affected by a number of factors that are largely beyond our control but could nevertheless have a significant negative impact on us. These factors include, but are not limited to:
•Fluctuations or frequent variances in interest rates and credit spreads;
•The availability of credit, including the price, terms and conditions under which it can be obtained;
•A decrease in consumer spending or sentiment, including as a result of increases in savings rates and tax increases, and any effect that this might have on retail activity;
•The actual and perceived state of the real estate market, market for dividend-paying stocks and public capital markets in general; and
•Unemployment rates, both nationwide and within the primary markets in which we operate.
In addition, increased inflation might have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness and our general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents. Inflation might adversely affect tenant leases with stated rent increases, which could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time. Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact our tenants' sales and, in turn, our own results of operations.
Conversely, deflation might result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. The predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. Restricted lending practices might impact our ability to obtain financing for our properties and might also negatively impact our tenants' ability to obtain credit. Decreases in consumer demand can have a direct impact on our tenants and the rents we receive.
A slow-growing economy hinders consumer spending, which could decrease the level of discretionary income available for shopping at our properties. Weak income growth could weigh down consumer spending, which could be further affected if the overall economy suffers a setback.
Risks Related to Technology
Risks associated with the implementation of new information systems or upgrades to existing systems may interfere with our operations or ability to maintain adequate records.
We are continuing to implement new information systems and upgrades to existing systems as part of our growing business and problems with the design as well as the security or implementation of these new or upgraded systems could interfere with our operations or ability to maintain adequate and secure records.
The occurrence of cyber incidents, a deficiency in our cyber security, or a data breach could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.
A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources. More specifically, a cyber-incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupting data, or stealing confidential information. We rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, some of which may be confidential and/or proprietary, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. Primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber-incident include, but are not limited to, operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our tenants and other business partners, and private data exposure (including personally identifiable information, or proprietary and confidential information, of ours and our employees, as well as third parties). Any such incidents could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, and reduce the benefits of our advanced technologies. We carry cyber liability insurance; however, a loss could exceed the limits of the policy. We have implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks, such as providing security awareness training with simulated spam, phishing and social engineering attacks for employees.
We perform mock incident and mock disasters to test the adequacy of our internal incident response plan and that our employees are properly prepared. We leverage a third party security firm to perform risk assessments. However, these measures, our increased awareness of a risk of a cyber-incident, and our insurance coverage, do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.
Risks Related to Environmental Issues
As owners of real estate, we might face liabilities or other significant costs related to environmental issues.
Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment might require us, as a current or previous owner or operator of real property, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties. These laws and regulations might require us to abate or remove asbestos containing materials in the event of damage, demolition or renovation, reconstruction or expansion of a property and 
also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. These laws and regulations also govern the installation, maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products. Many of our properties contain, or at one time contained, asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks (primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment). The costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances could be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The presence of contamination, or the failure to remediate contamination, might also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral.
In addition, under various federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate might be held liable to third parties for bodily injury or property damage incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or otherwise caused, the release of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of contamination at any of our properties, or the failure to remediate contamination discovered at such properties, could result in significant costs to us and/or materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral.
For example, federal, state and local laws require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which might be substantial for certain re-developments. These regulations also govern emissions of, and exposure to, asbestos fibers in the air, which might necessitate implementation of site-specific maintenance practices. Certain laws also impose liability for the release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties might seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury or property damage associated with asbestos-containing materials. Asbestos-containing building materials are present at some of our properties and might be present at others. To minimize the risk of on-site asbestos being improperly disturbed, we have developed and implemented asbestos operations and maintenance programs to manage asbestos-containing materials and suspected asbestos-containing materials in accordance with applicable legal requirements, however we cannot be certain that our programs eliminate all risk of asbestos being improperly disturbed. Any liability, and the associated costs thereof, we might face for environmental matters could adversely impact our ability to operate our business and our financial condition.
Lastly, in connection with certain mortgages on our properties, our affiliate, Washington Prime Property, L.P., singly, or together with WPG L.P. and certain other affiliates, have executed environmental indemnification agreements to indemnify the respective lenders for those loans against losses or costs to remediate damage to the mortgaged property caused by the presence or release of hazardous materials.
We are subject to various regulatory requirements, and any changes in such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The laws, regulations and policies governing our business, or the regulatory or enforcement environment at the national level or in any of the states in which we operate, might change at any time and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are unable to predict how any future legislative or regulatory proposals or programs will be administered or implemented, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Additionally, changes in tax laws might have a significant impact on our operating results. For more information regarding the impact of changing tax laws on our operating results, please refer to the risk factors section titled "Risks Related to WPG Inc.'s Status as a REIT."
Also, we may be required to expend significant sums of money to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (“ADA”), and other federal, state, and local laws in order for our properties and facilities (including those in and a part of cyberspace) to meet requirements related to access and use by physically challenged persons. Additionally, unanticipated costs and expenses may be incurred in connection with defending lawsuits relating to ADA compliance not covered by our liability insurance.
Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and on our reputation generally. We are unable to give any assurances that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently, or that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Some of our potential losses might not be covered by insurance.
We maintain insurance coverage with financially-sound insurers for property, third-party liability, terrorism, workers compensation, and rental loss insurance on all of our properties. However, certain catastrophic perils are subject to large deductibles that may cause an adverse impact on our operating results. Additionally, there are some types of losses, including those caused by or attributed to the COVID-19 (or a mutant strain of it) pandemic for which prospective claimants will assert tort or negligence claims or losses which relate to business interference or disruption linked to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as lease and other contract claims, that are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, or a loss 
for which there is a large deductible occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate.
We currently maintain insurance coverage for acts of terrorism by foreign or domestic agents. The U.S. government provides reinsurance coverage to insurance companies following a declared terrorism event under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019, which is a modified extension of the original Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act ("TRIA") of 2002. TRIA was designed to force insurance carriers to provide optional terrorism coverage solutions to all insureds that receive an issued insurance policy in the U.S., in which the insurance carriers would be supplied reinsurance support from the U.S. government under the act of declared terrorism events that cause or create in excess of $100 million in damages or losses. The U.S. government could terminate its reinsurance of terrorism, thus increasing the risk of uninsured losses for such acts. Our tenants, vendors and joint venture partners in retail and otherwise are subject to similar risks.
We face possible risks associated with climate change.
We understand that climate change presents serious challenges at local, regional and global levels. Significant risks arise from both physical impacts and the transition to a low carbon future. Over time, physical impacts, including adverse weather events and rising sea levels, could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain properties or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate the properties at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) insurance on favorable terms and increasing the cost of energy at our properties. Moreover, compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or increase taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties. At the same time there are potential business opportunities from the transition to a low carbon economy and we are currently undertaking a robust climate change risk assessment process, based on the recommendations of the 2017 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report, to ensure we are mitigating the threats and capitalizing on the opportunities.  At this time, there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters.
A number of our properties are located in Florida, California, Texas, and Hawaii or in other areas with a higher risk of natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, or tsunamis. The occurrence of natural disasters can adversely impact operations, redevelopment, or development at our centers and projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs, and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. Additionally, some of our properties are located in coastal regions, and would therefore be affected by any future increases in sea levels. If insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Risks Related to the Separation from SPG
Potential indemnification liabilities to SPG pursuant to certain separation agreements could materially adversely affect our operations.
Certain separation agreements with SPG provide for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to affect the separation, certain conditions to the separation and distribution and provisions governing our relationship with SPG with respect to and following the separation and distribution. Among other things, the separation agreements provide for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the separation and distribution, as well as those obligations of SPG that we will assume pursuant to the separation agreements. If we are required to indemnify SPG under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.
In connection with our separation from SPG, SPG will indemnify us for certain pre-distribution liabilities and liabilities related to SPG assets. However, there can be no assurance that these indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that SPG's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.
Pursuant to certain separation agreements, SPG has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that SPG agrees to retain, and there can be no assurance that SPG will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from SPG any amounts for which we are held liable, such indemnification may be insufficient to fully offset the financial impact of such liabilities and/or we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from SPG.
Risks Related to WPG Inc.'s Status as a REIT
If WPG Inc. fails to remain qualified as a REIT, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face substantial tax liability, which would substantially reduce funds available for distribution to its shareholders and result in other negative consequences.
If WPG Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on its taxable income at regular corporate rates, and distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by WPG Inc. in computing its taxable income. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to WPG Inc.'s shareholders, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the value of, and trading prices for, WPG Inc.'s common shares. Unless WPG Inc. is deemed to be entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code, it would also be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which it initially ceased to qualify as a REIT.
Furthermore, the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") requires, as a condition to the listing of WPG Inc.'s common shares, that WPG Inc. maintain its REIT status. Consequently, if WPG Inc. fails to maintain its REIT status, its common shares could promptly be delisted from the NYSE, which would decrease the trading activity of such common shares, making the sale of such common shares difficult.
Dividends paid by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.
Dividends paid by certain non-REIT corporations to their shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates are generally taxed at reduced tax rates. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the shares of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including WPG Inc.'s common shares.
Qualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code.
Qualifying as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize WPG Inc.'s REIT qualification. WPG Inc.'s qualification as a REIT will depend on WPG Inc.'s satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Compliance with these requirements must be carefully monitored on a continuing basis, and there can be no assurance that WPG Inc.'s personnel responsible for doing so will be able to successfully monitor WPG Inc.'s compliance, despite clauses in the property management agreements requiring such monitoring. Additionally, WPG Inc.'s ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify to be taxed as a REIT might depend, in part, on the actions of third parties over which we have either no control or only limited influence.
Monitoring REIT qualification for both WPG Inc. as well as the separate individual REITs within joint venture arrangements adds compliance complexity.
REIT compliance is required to be tested for WPG Inc. as well as any subsidiary REIT within our structure. Each REIT’s compliance is tested and determined separately. Therefore, the subsidiary REITs have a lower materiality threshold. If one of the subsidiary REITs failed to be REIT compliant it may impact the REIT status of WPG Inc.
Legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting REITs, including positions taken by the IRS, could have a negative effect on WPG Inc.
The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury"). Although we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a REIT, changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the IRS and the Treasury, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect WPG Inc.'s investors or WPG Inc. WPG Inc. cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect its investors or WPG Inc. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect WPG Inc.'s ability to qualify to be taxed as a REIT and/or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to WPG Inc.'s investors and WPG Inc. of such qualification.
Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect stockholders.
Future changes to tax laws may adversely affect the taxation of a REIT, its subsidiaries or its stockholders. These changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets. These potential changes could generally result in REITs having fewer tax advantages, and may lead REITs to determine that it would be more advantageous to elect to be taxed, for federal income tax purposes, as a corporation.
Not all states automatically conform to changes in the Code. Some states use the legislative process to decide whether it is in their best interests to conform or not to various provisions of the Code. This could increase the complexity of our compliance efforts, increase compliance costs, and may subject us to additional taxes and audit risk.
WPG Inc.'s REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan.
In order for WPG Inc. to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied, it generally must distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to its shareholders each year, so that U.S. federal corporate income tax does not apply to earnings that it distributes. To the extent that WPG Inc. satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a REIT, but distributes less than 100% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains, it will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income. Additionally, WPG Inc. will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that it distributes to its shareholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. WPG Inc. intends to make distributions to its shareholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code.
From time to time, WPG Inc. might generate taxable income greater than its cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves, or required debt or amortization payments. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices, distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, or make taxable distributions of WPG Inc.'s capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable WPG Inc. to pay out enough of its taxable income to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. Further, amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business. Thus, compliance with WPG Inc.'s REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan.
Even if WPG Inc. remains qualified as a REIT, it could face other tax liabilities that reduce its cash flows.
Even if WPG Inc. remains qualified for taxation as a REIT, it could be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on its income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state or local income, property and transfer taxes. For example, in order to meet the REIT qualification requirements, WPG Inc. may hold some of its assets or conduct certain of its activities through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs") or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to federal, state and local corporate-level income taxes as regular C corporations. Additionally, WPG Inc. might incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with a TRS if they are not conducted on an arm's-length basis. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to WPG Inc.'s shareholders.
Complying with WPG Inc.'s REIT requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities, liquidate otherwise attractive investments, or never pursue viable and profitable business or commercial ventures.
To qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, WPG Inc. must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of its assets consist of cash, cash items, government securities and "real estate assets" (as defined in the Code), including certain mortgage loans and securities. The remainder of WPG Inc.'s investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
Additionally, in general, no more than 5% of the value of WPG Inc.'s total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If WPG Inc. fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, it must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we might be required to liquidate, forego otherwise attractive investments, or never pursue viable and profitable business or commercial ventures. These actions could have the effect of reducing WPG Inc.'s income and amounts available for distribution to its shareholders.
In addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, WPG Inc. must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the amounts it distributes to its shareholders and the ownership of its shares. We might be unable to pursue investments or business or commercial ventures that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements of WPG Inc. for qualifying as a REIT. Thus, compliance with WPG Inc.'s REIT requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or pursue viable and profitable business or commercial ventures.
Complying with WPG Inc.'s REIT requirements might limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause WPG Inc. to incur tax liabilities.
The REIT provisions of the Code to which WPG Inc. must adhere substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. Income from certain potential hedging transactions that we may enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or from transactions to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that satisfy WPG Inc.'s REIT gross income tests (including gain from the termination of such a transaction) does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests that apply to REITs, provided that certain identification requirements are met. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to properly identify such transaction as a hedge, the income is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of WPG Inc.'s gross income tests.
As a result of these rules, we might be required to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a total return swap. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because the total return swap may be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear.
Additionally, losses in the total return swap will generally not provide any tax benefit, except that such losses could theoretically be carried back or forward against WPG Inc.'s past or future taxable income in the total return swap.
The share ownership limit imposed by the Code for REITs, and WPG Inc.'s amended and restated articles of incorporation, may inhibit market activity in WPG Inc.'s shares and restrict our business combination opportunities.
In order for WPG Inc. to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% in value of its outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year after its first taxable year. WPG Inc.'s amended and restated articles of incorporation, with certain exceptions, authorize its Board of Directors to take the actions that are necessary and desirable to preserve its qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors, no person may own more than 8%, or 18% in the case of certain family members and other related persons of Mr. David Simon, the current Chairman and CEO of SPG and former member of our Board of Directors, of any class of WPG Inc.'s capital stock or any combination thereof, determined by the number of shares outstanding, voting power or value (as determined by WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors), whichever produces the smallest holding of capital stock under the three methods, computed with regard to all outstanding shares of capital stock and, to the extent provided by the Code, all shares of WPG Inc.'s capital stock issuable under outstanding options and exchange rights that have not been exercised. WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors may grant an exemption in its sole discretion, subject to such conditions, representations and undertakings as it may determine in its sole discretion. These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for WPG Inc.'s common shares or otherwise be in the best interest of WPG Inc.'s shareholders.
Risks Related to Our Common and Preferred Shares/Units
We cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of distributions on our shares/units.
We suspended the payment of regular cash distributions on our common shares of beneficial interest ("Common Shares") and WPG L.P. operating partnership units ("O.P. Units") during 2020, and it is unlikely that we will be able to reinstate our regular cash distributions given our need to restructure our indebtedness. The payment, timing and amount of any future distributions to shareholders will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions regarding the payment of distributions, if any, will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, limitations under our financing arrangements, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that it deems relevant. Given our current liquidity and need to restructure our indebtedness, we do not expect to make cash distributions in the foreseeable future.
The market value or trading price of our preferred and Common Shares has declined steeply and could decline further, and there is no guarantee that equity holders will recover any value in a bankruptcy proceeding.
The market value or trading price of our preferred and Common Shares has declined steeply and could decline further and there is no guarantee that equity holders will recover any value in a bankruptcy proceeding. Further, it is possible that our preferred shares or Common Shares will be canceled and extinguished in any Chapter 11 Cases and the holders thereof would not be entitled to receive, and would not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In the event of a cancellation of our preferred shares or Common Shares, amounts invested by such holders in our outstanding Common Shares will not be recoverable. Consequently, our currently outstanding preferred shares or Common Shares would have no value. Trading prices for our preferred shares or Common Shares are very volatile and may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders of such securities in any Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, we urge 
that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our equity securities and any of our other securities.
Your percentage of ownership in WPG Inc. may be diluted in the future.
In the future, your percentage ownership in us may be diluted because of future equity issuances. For example, in a Restructuring transaction, we could issue additional common or preferred shares, diluting your ownership percentage, perhaps materially. WPG Inc.'s amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize WPG Inc. to issue, without the approval of its shareholders, one or more additional classes or series of preferred shares having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common shares respecting dividends and distributions, as WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors generally may determine.
The terms of one or more such classes or series of preferred shares could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of WPG Inc.'s common shares. For example, WPG Inc. could grant the holders of preferred shares the right to elect some number of WPG Inc. directors in all events or on the occurrence of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred shares could affect the residual value of the common shares.
Certain provisions in WPG Inc.'s amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws, and provisions of Indiana law, might prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of WPG Inc.'s common shares.
WPG Inc.'s amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws contain, and Indiana law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:
•The inability of WPG Inc.'s shareholders to call a special meeting;
•Restrictions on the ability of WPG Inc.'s shareholders to act by written consent without a meeting;
•Advance notice requirements and other limitations on the ability of shareholders to present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;
•The right of WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval;
•Limitations on the ability of WPG Inc.'s shareholders to remove directors;
•The ability of WPG Inc.'s directors, and not shareholders, to fill vacancies on WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors;
•Restrictions on the number of shares of capital stock that individual shareholders may own;
•Limitations on the exercise of voting rights in respect of any "control shares" acquired in a control share acquisition, which WPG Inc. has currently opted out of in WPG Inc.'s amended and restated bylaws but which could apply to WPG Inc. in the future; and
•Restrictions on an "interested shareholder" to engage in certain business combinations with WPG Inc. for a five-year period following the date the interested shareholder became such.
We believe these provisions will protect WPG Inc.'s shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors and by providing WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of WPG Inc. and its shareholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.
Several of the agreements that we entered into with SPG in connection with the separation require SPG's consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements, but these agreements generally expired within two years of May 28, 2014, except for certain agreements that continue for longer terms. These agreements include certain separation agreements and tax matters agreements. The consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage, delay or prevent a strategic transaction that you may consider favorable.
In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of WPG Inc.'s common shares could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax related agreement(s) we had with SPG following the separation, we would be required to indemnify SPG for any resulting taxes and related amounts, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a strategic transaction that you may consider favorable.
Certain provisions in WPG L.P.'s amended and restated limited partnership agreement may limit our ability to execute transactions that our shareholders may consider favorable.
WPG L.P.'s amended and restated limited partnership agreement, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement") provides that we must obtain the approval of a majority of the units of limited partnership interest held by limited partners in order to merge or consolidate WPG L.P. or voluntarily sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of the unaffiliated assets of WPG L.P. Because WPG L.P.'s assets comprise substantially all of our assets, these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or impact the manner in which we do so, even if some of our shareholders believe that doing so would be in our and their best interests.
WPG Inc.'s significant shareholders may exert influence over our company that may be adverse to our best interests and those of WPG Inc.'s other shareholders.
A substantial portion of WPG Inc.'s outstanding common shares are held by a relatively small group of shareholders. This concentration of ownership may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of some or all of these shareholders. For example, the concentration of ownership currently held by the significant shareholders, even if they are not acting in a coordinated manner, could allow them to influence our policies and strategy and could delay, defer or prevent a change of control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that may otherwise be favorable to us and our other shareholders. Additionally, the interests of any of WPG Inc.'s significant shareholders, or any of their respective affiliates, could conflict with or differ from the interests of WPG Inc.'s other shareholders or the other significant shareholders. A significant shareholder or affiliate thereof may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.
Risks Related to Regulatory Requirements
Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and WPG Inc.'s share price.
As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. Additionally, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner or to otherwise comply with applicable law could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing.
In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we, among other things, establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business, or changes in applicable accounting rules. We cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that internal controls were effective. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in future reports, when such certifications will be required.
Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis, or may cause our company to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in our company and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm report a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or if the firm resigns in light of such a weakness. This could materially adversely affect our company by, for example, leading to a decline in WPG Inc.'s share price and impairing our ability to raise additional capital.
