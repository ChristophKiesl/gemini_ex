Item 1.  BUSINESS
 
Protective Insurance Corporation (referred to herein as "Protective") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana in 1930.  Through its subsidiaries, Protective engages in marketing and underwriting property, liability and workers' compensation coverage for trucking and public transportation fleets, as well as coverage for trucking industry independent contractors.
 
Protective’s principal subsidiaries are:
 
  
1. | Protective Insurance Company (referred to herein as "Protective Insurance Co."), which is licensed by insurance authorities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, all Canadian provinces and Puerto Rico;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Protective Specialty Insurance Company (referred to herein as "Protective Specialty"), which is currently approved for excess and surplus lines business by insurance authorities in 48 states and the District of Columbia and licensed in Indiana; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Sagamore Insurance Company (referred to herein as "Sagamore"), which is licensed by insurance authorities in 49 states and the District of Columbia and approved for excess and surplus lines business in one additional state;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | B&L Brokerage Services, Inc. (referred to herein as "BLBS"), an Indiana-domiciled insurance broker licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | B&L Insurance, Ltd. (referred to herein as "BLI"), which is domiciled and licensed in Bermuda.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Protective Insurance Co., Protective Specialty, Sagamore and BLI are collectively referred to herein as the "Insurance Subsidiaries."  The "Company", "we", "us" and "our", as used herein, refer to Protective and all of its subsidiaries unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
 
As is a common practice in the property and casualty insurance industry, the Insurance Subsidiaries share or "cede" portions of their gross premiums written with several non-affiliated reinsurers under excess of loss and quota share treaties covering predetermined groups of risks and by facultative (individual policy-by-policy) placements.  Reinsurance is ceded to spread the risk of loss from individual claims or groups of claims among several reinsurers and is an integral part of the Company's business.
 
In 2019, the Insurance Subsidiaries primarily served the commercial automobile market, although the Insurance Subsidiaries continue to support previously written policies in specialty markets for which the Company has discontinued writing business, and these operations are in run-off.  The Company expects targeted growth to occur in its core business of commercial automobile and workers' compensation.
 
The Company operates as one reportable property and casualty insurance segment based on how its operating results are regularly reviewed by its chief operating decision maker when making decisions about how resources are to be allocated to the segment and assessing its performance.
 
Product Lines
 
Commercial Automobile
 
The Insurance Subsidiaries provide coverage for larger companies in the motor carrier industry that retain substantial amounts of self-insurance, for independent contractors utilized by trucking companies, for medium-sized and small trucking companies on a first- dollar or deductible basis, and for public livery concerns, principally covering fleets of commercial buses.  This group of products is collectively referred to as commercial automobile.  Large fleet trucking products are marketed both directly to commercial automobile clients and also through relationships with non-affiliated brokers and specialized agents.  Products for small and intermediate fleets and independent contractors are marketed through relationships with non-affiliated brokers and specialized agents.  In some cases, the Insurance Subsidiaries will provide customized product offerings to specific markets through partnerships with brokers or program administrators.  In most cases, the Company's commercial automobile policies are written on an "occurrence" basis.  This means that the Company may be liable for claims that occurred when its policy was in place with an insured, regardless of when those claims are reported to the Company, and it may take months or even years for claims to be reported to the Company.
 
The principal types of commercial automobile insurance marketed by the Insurance Subsidiaries are:
 
  
● | Commercial motor vehicle liability, physical damage and general liability insurance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Workers' compensation insurance;
--+---------------------------------


● | Specialized accident (medical and indemnity) insurance for independent contractors in the trucking industry;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Non-trucking motor vehicle liability insurance for independent contractors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fidelity and surety bonds; and
--+-------------------------------


● | Inland marine insurance consisting principally of cargo insurance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Insurance Subsidiaries also perform a variety of additional services, primarily for the Company's insureds, including risk surveys and analyses, safety program design and monitoring, government compliance assistance, loss control and cost studies and research, development, and consultation in connection with new insurance programs, including development of systems to assist customers in monitoring their accident data.  The Company also provides claims handling services, primarily to excess clients with self-insurance programs.
 
Workers' Compensation
 
The Insurance Subsidiaries provide workers' compensation insurance for the commercial automobile industry, primarily to employees of motor carriers or independent contractors providing services in the transportation industry.  In 2017, the Company began marketing workers' compensation coverage beyond commercial automobile clients to a variety of non-transportation operations, such as light manufacturing, restaurants, retailers, and professional services on both a first-dollar and deductible basis.  In 2019, the Company took actions to reduce exposure to workers’ compensation coverage for non-transportation risks.  While the Company may continue to underwrite select non-transportation risks, the Company’s primary focus will be underwriting workers’ compensation coverage for transportation risks.  In most cases, the Company's workers' compensation policies are written on an "occurrence" basis.  This means that the Company may be liable for claims that occurred when its policy was in place with an insured, regardless of when those claims are reported to the Company, and it may take months or even years for claims to be reported to the Company.
Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
 
Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred on average comprise approximately two-thirds of the Company's operating expenses.
 
The Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses ("LAE") of the Insurance Subsidiaries before the application of reinsurance credits (gross reserves).  The liabilities for losses and LAE are determined using case basis evaluations and statistical projections and represent estimates of the Company's ultimate exposure for all unpaid losses and LAE incurred through December 31 of each year.  These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency and are continually reviewed and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the liability is adjusted as necessary.  Such adjustments, either positive or negative, are reflected in current operations as recorded.
 
The Company's reserves for losses and loss expenses are determined based on evaluations of individual reported claims and by actuarial estimation processes using historical experience, current economic information and, when necessary, available industry statistics.  "Case basis" loss reserves are evaluated on an individual case-by-case basis by experienced claims adjusters using established Company guidelines and are monitored by claims management.  Additionally, "bulk" reserves are established for (1) those losses which have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company ("incurred but not reported" claims), (2) provisions for any possible deficiencies in the case reserving process and (3) the expected external and internal costs to fully settle each claim, also referred to as LAE.  Common actuarial methods are employed in the establishment of bulk reserves using Company historical loss data, consideration of changes in the Company's business and study of current economic trends affecting ultimate claims costs.  LAE reserves include amounts ultimately allocable to individual claims as well as amounts required for the general overhead of the claims handling operation that are not specifically allocable to individual claims.  Historical analyses of the ratio of LAE to losses paid on prior closed claims and study of current economic trends affecting loss settlement costs are used to estimate the LAE reserve needs relative to the established loss reserves.  Each of these reserve categories contains elements of uncertainty, which assures variability when compared to the ultimate costs to settle the underlying claims for which the reserves are established.  For a more detailed discussion of the three categories of reserves, see "Loss and Loss Expense Reserves" under the caption, "Critical Accounting Policies" in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Beginning in early 2019, the Company began strategically buying facultative reinsurance on policies with $5.0 million limits, specifically in our excess automobile and public transportation books of business.  This reinsurance coverage has served to lower the loss limit on a significant portion of the Company’s commercial automobile liability policies to $2.0 million for a single occurrence.  This action, coupled with the renewal of our annual aggregate deductible treaty at a 35% quota share rate, whereby once the aggregate stop-loss level is reached the Company is responsible for its 65% retention, has significantly reduced the Company’s exposure and volatility to large commercial automobile liability losses.
 
The Company is a cedent under numerous reinsurance treaties covering its product lines.  Treaties are typically written on an annual basis, each with its own renewal date.  However, treaty terms may occasionally be agreed to for periods beyond one year.  Treaty renewals are expected to largely continue to occur annually in the foreseeable future.  Because losses from certain of the Company's products can experience delays in being reported and can take years to settle, losses reported to the Company in the current year may be covered by a number of older reinsurance treaties with higher or lower net loss exposures than those provided by current treaty provisions.
 
The table below sets forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending loss and LAE liability balances for 2019, 2018 and 2017.  This table includes reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, to correspond with the presentation in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, but also includes a reconciliation of beginning and ending loss and LAE liability, gross of reinsurance recoverable, as presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  All amounts are shown net of reinsurance, unless otherwise indicated.

The reconciliation above shows the Company's estimate of net losses on 2018 and prior accident years is approximately $0.6 million lower at December 31, 2019 than was provided in loss reserves at December 31, 2018 (referred to as a "reserve savings").  This compares to a $16.8 million reserve deficiency on prior accident years in 2018 and a $19.2 million reserve deficiency reported in 2017 related to prior accident years.
 
The following table is a summary of the 2019 calendar year reserve savings by accident year (dollars in thousands):
 

Years in Which Losses Were Incurred | Reserve at December 31, 2018 | | (Savings) Deficiency Recorded During 2019 (1) | | | % (Savings) Deficiency

 | $ | 489,404 | | $ | (550 | ) | (.1 | )%


(1) | Consists of development on cases known at December 31, 2018, losses reported which were previously unknown at December 31, 2018 (incurred but not reported), unallocated loss expense paid related to accident years 2018 and prior and changes in the reserves for incurred but not reported losses and loss expenses.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The savings shown in accident years 2018 and 2017 in the table above reflect favorable loss development in both short-tail lines of business, such as physical damage, and the Company's independent contractor products (including non-trucking liability, occupational accident and workers' compensation).  The deficiencies in accident years 2013 and prior through 2016 are largely the result of several severe transportation losses.  The Company took and continues to take action in all accident years to reflect new trends in loss development for commercial automobile products that have emerged over the last several years.  These actions include case reserving reviews, as well as continued actuarial product reviews, and resulted in the reserve strengthening noted in accident years 2016 and prior.
 
Bulk loss reserves are established to provide for potential future adverse development on cases known to the Company and for cases unknown at the reserve date.  Changes in the reserves for incurred but not reported losses and loss expenses occur based upon information received on known and newly reported cases during the current year and the effect of that development on the application of standard actuarial methods used by the Company.
 
The Company continues to incorporate more recent loss development data into its loss reserving formulae; however, the dynamic nature of losses associated with the commercial automobile business, as well as the timing of settlement of large claims, increases the likelihood of variability in loss developments from period to period.  While the Company's basic assumptions have remained consistent, the Company continues to update loss data to reflect changing trends, which can be expected to result in fluctuations in loss developments over time.
 
Management's goal is to produce an overall estimate of reserves which is sufficient and as close to expected ultimate losses as possible.  The Company constantly monitors changes in trends related to the number of claims incurred relative to correlative variances with premium volume, average settlement amounts, number of claims outstanding at period ends and the average value per claim outstanding and adjusts actuarial assumptions as necessary to accommodate observed trends.

Reserve developments for all years ended in the period 1985 through 2011 have produced redundancies as of December 31, 2019, with deficiencies developing for periods from 2012 to 2018.  The $0.6 million savings developed through one year on the 2018 reserve position reflects (1) action taken by management to respond to higher than expected adverse commercial automobile case development and (2) continued favorable development in short-tail lines and workers' compensation.  The deficiencies that developed in the chart from 2012 through 2018 have been largely attributable to two main factors.  First, the Company engaged in new markets between 2008 and 2013, including professional liability and property coverages concentrated in the state of Florida.  These products (now discontinued) experienced significant adverse loss development in calendar years 2016 and 2017 as more information emerged and was therefore considered in the reserving process.  Second, the Company has experienced increased severity in losses related to its commercial automobile transportation offerings.  During 2019, the Company continued to address the rate adequacy and customer segmentation practices of these products in response to these adverse loss trends.

Readers should note the table above does not present accident or policy year development data, which they may be more accustomed to analyzing.  Rather, this table is intended to present an evaluation of the Company's ability to establish its liability for losses and loss expenses at a given balance sheet date.  In reviewing this information, it is important to understand that this method of presentation causes some development experience to be duplicated.  For example, the amount of any redundancy or deficiency related to losses settled in 2012, but incurred in 2009, will be included in the cumulative development amount for each of the years ending December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011.  It is also important to note that conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.
 
The table below presents loss development data on a gross (before consideration of reinsurance) basis for the same ten-year period December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2018, as of December 31, 2019, with a reconciliation of the data to the net amounts shown in the table above.

Readers are reminded the gross data presented above requires significantly more subjectivity in the estimation of IBNR and loss expense reserves because of the high limits provided by the Company to its commercial automobile and workers' compensation customers, some of which has been covered by excess of loss and facultative reinsurance.  This is particularly true of excess of loss treaties in which the Company retains risk in only the lower, more predictable, layers of coverage.  Accordingly, one would generally expect more variability in development on a gross basis than on a net basis.  The Company's consolidated financial statements reflect its financial results net of reinsurance.
 
Environmental Matters:
 
Given that one of the Company's core businesses is insuring commercial automobile companies, on occasion claims involving a commercial automobile accident which has resulted in the spill of a pollutant are made.  Certain of the Company's policies may cover these situations on the basis that they were caused by an accident that resulted in the immediate and isolated spill of a pollutant.  These claims are typically reported, evaluated and fully resolved within a short period of time.

In general, establishing reserves for environmental claims, other than those associated with "sudden and accidental" losses, is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those represented by other types of claims.  Factors contributing to those uncertainties include a lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage, and the extent and timing of any such contractual liability.  Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when the loss occurred and what policies provide coverage, what claims are covered, whether there is an insured obligation to defend, how policy limits are determined, how policy exclusions are applied and interpreted, and whether cleanup costs represent insured property damage.
 
Very few environmental claims have historically been reported to the Company.  In addition, a review of the businesses of the Company's past and current insureds indicates that exposure to claims of an environmental nature is typically limited because the vast majority of the Company's accounts are not currently, and have not in the past been, involved in the hauling of hazardous substances.  Also, the revision of the pollution exclusion in the Company's policies since 1986 limits exposure to such claims.
 
The Company does not expect to have any significant environmental claims relating to asbestos exposure.
 
The Company's reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2019 did not include significant amounts for liability related to environmental damage claims.  The Company does not foresee significant future exposure to environmental damage claims and accordingly has established no reserve for IBNR environmental losses at December 31, 2019.
 
Marketing
 
Historically, the Insurance Subsidiaries have primarily focused their commercial automobile marketing efforts on large and medium-sized trucking fleets, with their biggest market share in larger trucking fleets (over 150 power units).  The largest of these fleets (over 250 power units) generally self-insure a significant portion of their risk, and self-insured retention plans are a specialty of the Company.  The indemnity contract provided to such customers is designed to cover all aspects of commercial automobile liability, including third-party liability, property damage, physical damage and cargo, whether arising from vehicular accident or other casualty loss.  The self-insured program is supplemented with large deductible workers' compensation policies in states which do not allow for self-insurance of this coverage.  Fleets with fewer than 250 power units typically purchase full insurance coverage or retain deductibles on each claim.  The Company's commercial automobile offerings also include public livery risks, principally small operators of bus fleets, work-related accident insurance, on a group or individual basis, to independent contractors under contract to a fleet sponsor, as well as workers' compensation coverage to employees of independent contractor fleet owners.  Large fleet trucking products are marketed both directly to commercial automobile clients and also through relationships with non-affiliated brokers and specialized independent agents.
 
In addition, the Company offers a program of coverages for "small fleet" trucking concerns (owner-operators generally with one to six power units) and "medium fleet" trucking concerns (7 to 150 power units). Products for small and medium fleets, independent contractors, and non-trucking entities are marketed through relationships with non-affiliated brokers and specialized agents.
 
In some cases, the Company will provide specific product offerings to specialized markets through partnerships with brokers and program administrators.  As the Company has grown, its distribution strategy has moved toward utilization of non-affiliated agents and brokers to place new business for small and intermediate commercial automobile (including independent contractor products).  In addition, the Company has developed customized commercial automobile liability and workers' compensation programs, which are marketed through non-affiliated agent partners.  These customized programs can include a suite of products selected for its targeted customer base, including commercial automobile liability, general liability, non-trucking liability, cargo, occupational accident, or workers' compensation coverages.
 
Investments
 
The Company's investment portfolio is notionally divided between (1) funds which are considered necessary to support insurance underwriting activities and (2) excess capital funds.  Management believes the funds invested in fixed income and short-term securities are more than sufficient to cover underwriting operations while equity securities and limited partnerships are utilized to invest excess capital funds to achieve higher long-term returns.  The following discussion will concentrate on the different investment strategies for these two major categories.
At December 31, 2019, the market value of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio was approximately $968.2 million, consisting of fixed income securities, equity securities, investments in limited partnerships, commercial mortgage loans and short-term and other investments and included $59.8 million of short-term funds classified as cash equivalents.

A comparison of the allocation of assets within the Company's consolidated investment portfolio, using market value as a basis, is as follows as of December 31:
 

 | 2019 | | | 2018
-------------------------------------------------+------+-------+---+-----
Fixed income securities | | 82.2 | % | | 67.5 | %
Short-term | | 0.1 | | | 0.1 | 
Cash equivalents | | 6.2 | | | 17.8 | 
Total fixed income and short-term securities | | 88.5 | | | 85.4 | 
Limited partnerships (equity basis) | | 2.4 | | | 6.3 | 
Commercial mortgage loans (amortized cost basis) | | 1.2 | | | 0.8 | 
Equity securities | | 7.9 | | | 7.5 | 
 | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | %

 
Fixed Income and Short-Term Investments
 
Fixed income and short-term securities comprised 88.5% of the market value of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio of $968.2 million at December 31, 2019.  The fixed income portfolio is widely diversified with no concentrations in any single industry, geographic location or municipality.  The largest amount invested in any single issuer was $4.0 million (0.4% of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio).  The Company's fixed income portfolio has a short duration compared to the duration of its insurance liabilities and, accordingly, the Company does not actively trade fixed income securities but typically holds such investments until maturity.  Exceptions exist in instances where the underlying credit for a specific issue is deemed to be diminished.  In such cases, the security will be considered for disposal prior to maturity.  In addition, fixed income securities may be sold when realignment of the portfolio is considered beneficial (e.g., moving from taxable to non-taxable issues) or when valuations are considered excessive compared to alternative investments.
 
Approximately $61.2 million of the Company's fixed income investments (6.3% of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio, which includes money market instruments classified as cash equivalents) consisted of non-rated bonds and bonds rated as less than investment grade by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") at year end.  These investments had a $0.7 million aggregate net unrealized gain position at December 31, 2019.
 
The market value of the consolidated fixed income portfolio included $12.5 million of net unrealized gains at December 31, 2019 compared to $7.9 million of net unrealized losses at December 31, 2018.  The Company analyzes fixed income securities for other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board OTTI guidance.  As has been the Company's consistent policy, OTTI is considered for any individual issue which has sustained a decline in current market value of at least 20% below original or adjusted cost, and the decline is ongoing for more than six months, regardless of the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the issuer or the specific issue.  Additionally, the Company takes into account any known subjective information in evaluating for impairment without consideration of the Company's 20% threshold.  The current net unrealized gain on fixed income securities consists of $3.6 million of gross unrealized losses and $16.1 million of gross unrealized gains.  The gross unrealized losses equal approximately 0.5% of the cost of all fixed income securities.  See also "Critical Accounting Policies" in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding the Company's investment valuation.
 
Equity Securities
 
Because of the large amount of high-quality fixed income investments owned, relative to the Company's loss and loss expense reserves (net of reinsurance recoverables) and other liabilities, amounts invested in equity securities are not needed to fund current operations and, accordingly, can be committed for longer periods of time.  Equity securities comprised 7.9% of the market value of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio of $968.2 million at December 31, 2019.  The Company's equity securities portfolio consists of various securities with diversification from large to small capitalization issuers and among several industries.  The largest single-equity issue owned had a market value of $3.9 million at December 31, 2019 (0.4% of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio).
 
Realized gains related to the sale of equity securities during 2019 recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $1.9 million before taxes. Net unrealized gains on equity securities held at December 31, 2019 included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $9.3 million.
 
An individual equity security will be disposed of when it is determined by the Company's external investment managers or the Board of Directors' Investment Committee that there is little potential for future appreciation or to reallocate from equity to fixed income securities.  Securities are disposed of only when market conditions dictate, regardless of the impact, positively or negatively, on current period earnings.
 
As of January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ("ASU 2016-01"). The amendments in ASU 2016-01 changed the accounting for non-consolidated equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting by requiring changes in fair value to be recognized in income.  Previously, the Company's equity securities were classified as available-for-sale and changes in fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of shareholders' equity.

During 2018, the Company's external investment managers and the Board of Directors' Investment Committee determined that reallocation of the Company's equity portfolio would be beneficial and sold $149.2 million of its equity portfolio, resulting in a gain on sale of $51.9 million. The majority of these gains were included in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2017 and, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-01, were reclassified to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 and were therefore not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Limited Partnerships
 
The Company invests in various limited partnerships engaged in long-short equities, private equity, country-focused funds and real estate development as an alternative to direct equity investments.  The funds used for these investments are part of the Company's excess capital strategy.  At December 31, 2019, the aggregate carrying value was $23.3 million, comprising 2.4% of the market value of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio.
 
As a group, these investments increased in value during 2019, with the aggregate of the Company's share of such gains reported by the limited partnerships totaling approximately $1.6 million.
 
The Company follows the equity method of accounting for its limited partnership investments and, accordingly, records the total change in value as a component of net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities and limited partnership investments.  Readers are cautioned that reported increases and decreases in equity value of the Company's limited partnerships can change quickly as a result of volatile market conditions.  Limited partnerships also are highly illiquid investments, and the Company's ability to withdraw funds is generally subject to significant restrictions.
 
Investment Yields
 
Pre-tax net investment income increased $4.2 million, or 19%, during 2019, reflecting higher interest rates for shorter duration securities, increased dividends and increased invested assets from continuing positive cash flow from operations.  A comparison of consolidated investment yields, before consideration of investment management expenses, is as follows:

 | 2019 | | | 2018
-------------------------------------------------+------+-----+---+-----
Before federal tax: | | | | 
Investment income | | 3.3 | % | | 3.0 | %
Investment income plus investment gains (losses) | | 4.8 | | | (0.1 | )
After federal tax: | | | | | | 
Investment income | | 3.3 | | | 2.7 | 
Investment income plus investment gains (losses) | | 4.2 | | | (0.6 | )

Regulatory Framework
 
The Insurance Subsidiaries are currently subject to insurance industry regulation by each of the jurisdictions in which they are licensed.  In addition, minor portions of the Insurance Subsidiaries' business are subject to regulation by Bermudian and Canadian federal and provincial authorities.  As an insurance holding company, Protective is also subject to oversight from the Indiana Department of Insurance.  There can be no assurance that laws and regulations will not be changed by one or more of these regulatory bodies in ways that will require the Company to modify its business models and objectives.  In particular, the United States federal government continuously reviews the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including insurance companies, as well as tax laws and regulation, which could impact the Company's operations and performance. 
 
Additionally, changes in laws and regulations governing the insurance industry could have an impact on the Company's ability to generate historical levels of income from its insurance operations.  The Company is obligated to comply with numerous complex and varied governmental regulations in order to maintain its authority to write insurance business.  While the Company has continuously maintained each of its licenses without exception, failure to maintain compliance could result in governmental regulators temporarily preventing the Company from writing new business, thus having a detrimental effect on the Company.  Also, the ability of the Insurance Subsidiaries to modify certain insurance rates, specifically workers' compensation rates, is heavily regulated, and such rate increases are often denied or delayed for substantial periods by regulators.
 
Investments made by the Company's domestic Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated by guidelines promulgated by the NAIC, which are designed to provide protection for both policyholders and shareholders.  The statutory capital of each of the Insurance Subsidiaries substantially exceeds the minimum risk-based capital requirements set by the NAIC.  State regulatory authorities prescribe calculations of the minimum amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary for each insurance company to remain authorized.  These computations are referred to as risk-based capital requirements and are based on a number of complex factors, taking into consideration the quality and nature of assets, the historical adequacy of recorded liabilities and the specific nature of business conducted.  At December 31, 2019, the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements of the Insurance Subsidiaries was $131.6 million.  Actual consolidated statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2019 exceeded this requirement by $240.2 million.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 500 employees.
 
Revenue Concentration
 
The Company derives a significant percentage of its direct premium volume from certain FedEx Corporation subsidiaries and operating companies ("FedEx"), and from insurance coverage provided to FedEx's contracted service providers.  FedEx represented approximately $4.7 million, $16.2 million and $18.5 million of the Company's consolidated gross premiums written in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The decrease in 2019 is related to the non-renewal of certain excess coverage policies in late 2018.  An additional $172.8 million, $174.7 million and $189.4 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, was placed with the Company by a non-affiliated broker on behalf of contracted service providers of FedEx, but this additional business was not dependent upon the Company's direct business with FedEx.
Competition
 
Insurance underwriting is highly competitive.  The Insurance Subsidiaries compete with other stock and mutual companies and inter-insurance exchanges (reciprocals).  There are numerous insurance companies offering the lines of insurance which are currently written or may in the future be written by the Insurance Subsidiaries.  Many of these companies have been in business for longer periods of time, have significantly larger volumes of business, offer more diversified lines of insurance coverage and have significantly greater financial resources than the Company.  In many cases, competitors are willing to provide coverage for rates lower than those charged by the Insurance Subsidiaries.  Many potential clients self-insure workers' compensation and other risks for which the Company offers coverage, and some have organized "captive" insurance companies as subsidiaries through which they insure their own operations.  Some states have workers' compensation funds that preclude private companies from writing this business in those states.  Federal law also authorizes the creation of "Risk Retention Groups," which may write insurance coverages similar to those offered by the Company.
 
The Company believes it has a competitive advantage in its major lines of business as the result of its management and staff, its service and products, its willingness to custom build insurance programs for its customers, its centralized location with ready access to skilled employees, its proprietary databases and the use of technology with respect to its insureds.  However, should competitors determine to "buy" market share with unprofitable rates, the Insurance Subsidiaries will generally experience a decline in business until pricing returns to profitable levels.
