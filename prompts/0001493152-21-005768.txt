General Description of Business
 
Ballantyne Strong, Inc. (“Ballantyne Strong”, the “Company”, “us” or “we”), a Delaware corporation established in 1932, is a holding company with business operations in the entertainment industry and investments in public and privately held companies. Ballantyne Strong went public in 1995 and our shares are traded on the NYSE American market under the symbol “BTN.” Our website is www.ballantynestrong.com.
 
The Company conducts its operations primarily through its Strong Entertainment operating segment. We also operate our Digital Ignition technology incubator and co-working facility in Alpharetta, Georgia. In addition, we hold minority investment positions in one privately held company and two publicly traded companies. The Company’s strategic plan contemplates a combination of:
 

● | Investing in the operations and growth of our existing businesses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Evaluating opportunities to maximize value by monetizing investments in our existing businesses; and 
● | Investing in public companies, private companies or in other areas. 

 
Management is focused on improving the operating performance of its Strong Entertainment business segment as the United States and other countries recover from COVID-19 related business disruptions. We plan to manage the Strong Entertainment segment to grow market share and organic revenue and improve operating results with the intent of increasing the ultimate valuation of the business. The Company may seek to sell a minority, majority or all of its existing businesses as part of its strategic plans. In addition, we may invest in other public or private companies or acquire other businesses, which may be within or outside of the Company’s existing markets.

Operations
 
Overview
 
Our Strong Entertainment business segment manufactures and distributes premium large format projection screens and provides technical support services and other related products and services to the cinema exhibition industry, theme parks, schools, museums and other entertainment-related markets. We also distribute and support third party products, including digital projectors, servers, library management systems, menu boards and sound systems.
Products and Services
 
Projection Screens and Support Systems — We are the largest manufacturer and distributor of premium large format projection screens to the cinema industry in North America. We have an exclusive relationship to supply large format screens to IMAX and Cinemark theaters and supply many of the other major cinema operators worldwide. We also manufacture innovative screen support structures custom built to adapt to virtually any venue requirement, with a unique self-standing modular construction that allows for easy assembly and adjustable size.
 
We also manufacture and distribute curvilinear immersive screens to theme parks, museums, and schools, as well as for special events and military applications. Our Eclipse curvilinear screens are specially designed to provide maximum viewer engagement in media-based attractions and immersive projection environments. The solid surface minimizes light loss to maintain higher resolution at lower lumen output. Patented speaker panels allow selective placement of rear mounted speakers to ensure the audio derives from the source media on screen. Applications include interactive dark rides, 3D/4D theme park rides, flying theaters and motion simulators.
 
We believe that our screens are the highest quality in the industry providing the highest gain and other characteristics important to the exhibitor and its patrons. Our high quality is driven by our innovative manufacturing process, focus on quality control and our proprietary coatings. We believe we are the only major screen manufacturer that develops and produces its own proprietary coatings, which are critical to the overall quality, increased screen reflectivity and brightness and continued innovation of our screens.

Technical Services – We provide digital projection equipment installation and after-sale maintenance and network support services to the entertainment industry. Our field service technicians and our Network Operations Center (“NOC”) staff work hand in hand to monitor and resolve system and other issues for our customers. We service many of our customers under recurring revenue contracts providing for maintenance and repair to a wide range of installed digital equipment, providing our customers with a reliable turnkey outsourced service option. We also provide services to customers on a time and materials basis. Our NOC, staffed by software engineers and systems techs, operates 24/7/365 and monitors our customers’ networked equipment remotely, often providing proactive solutions to systems issues before they cause system failures.
 
Other Products – We distribute projectors, servers, audio systems and other third-party products including library management systems, lenses and lamps to customers in North and South America.
 
We also signed a reseller agreement with Blink Charging Co. (“Blink”) in February 2021 and plan to begin marketing and distributing electric vehicle (EV) charging stations to existing customers and other parties in the United States.
 
Markets
 
We sell our screen systems worldwide, with our primary markets being North America and Asia. Screen systems are primarily sold on a direct basis, although we also use third-party distributors and integrators in some markets.

 North and South America. We have a non-exclusive agreement with Blink that allows us to market electric vehicle charging stations in the United States.

Competition
 
While there are several smaller screen manufacturing companies, our primary competitor in the worldwide projection screen market for large format screens is Harkness Screens International Ltd. Competitive factors include product performance characteristics, quality, availability, location and price.
 
The markets for our other Strong Entertainment products and services are highly competitive, and the industry is fragmented. The primary competitive factors are price, product quality, features and customer support. Competition in the digital cinema equipment market includes other integrators and resellers. Manufacturers may also sell equipment directly to exhibitors, especially for large orders. Our primary competition for installation, after-sale maintenance, and NOC services is Christie Digital Systems USA, Inc., as well as smaller suppliers such as Tri-State Digital Services and Sonic Equipment Company, and in some cases internal resources of our larger entertainment customers.

This world class ISO certified operation has the capability of manufacturing multiple standard screens simultaneously to large format 2D and 3D screens for cinema and special venue applications.
Quality Control
 
We believe that our quality control procedures and the quality standards for the products that we manufacture, distribute or service have contributed significantly to our reputation for high performance and reliability. The inspection of incoming materials and components as well as the testing of all of our products during various stages of the sales and service cycle are key elements of this program.
Trademarks
 
We own or otherwise have rights to various trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with the sale of our products. We believe our success will not be dependent upon trademark protection, but rather upon our scientific and engineering capabilities and research and production techniques. We consider the Strong® trademark to be of value to our business.

All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status. We continue to monitor our demand for skilled and unskilled labor and provide training and competitive compensation packages in an effort to attract and retain skilled employees.
 
The Company, including its subsidiaries, remains deeply rooted in cinema screen manufacturing and cinema-focused services. In this regard, we continuously drive our efforts to be the best partner for our customers, investment for our stockholders, neighbor in our community and to provide an empowering work environment for our employees.
 
Moreover, the Company is committed to the health, safety and wellness of its employees. We have modified our business practices and implemented certain policies at our offices in accordance with best practices to accommodate, and at times mandate, social distancing and remote work practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhanced sanitary measures in our facilities, and cancelling attendance at events and conferences. In addition, we have invested in employee safety equipment, additional cleaning supplies and measures, re-designed production lines and workplaces as necessary and adapted new processes for interactions with our suppliers and customers to safely manage our operations.
 
Regulation
 
We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, environmental, safety and health requirements; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy; labor and employment; competition; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability.

Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products. There can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available, or be available at reasonable cost.
