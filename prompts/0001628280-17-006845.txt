ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General.
Rasna Therapeutics Inc. ("Rasna DE") was formed on May 28, 2013 by a highly experienced industry team together with field-leading scientists, to focus on developing therapeutics to address the unmet need that exists for Acute Myloid Leukemia ("AML") and other forms of leukemia and lymphoma.
The Company's primary indication is AML which may be fatal within weeks to months, has a 5-year survival rate of only about 25% and very poor prospects for long-term survival of patients. 
The Company's clinical program is based around three druggable intervention points with potential to improve safety and efficacy of current AML combination therapies.
History
Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. ("the Company", formerly Active With Me Inc.) was a company formed to create online resources that seamlessly offer travelers unique, highly relevant and user-friendly information on activity-based travel. 
On August 15, 2016 the Company, entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with Rasna DE and Rasna Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Rasna DE (the “Merger”), with Rasna DE surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company. The Merger Agreement was approved by the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Merger Sub and Rasna DE, as well as the requisite stockholders. The Merger closed on August 15, 2016.

Leukemia

Overview
Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow involving abnormal proliferation of white blood cells, called WBCs or leukocytes.  Leukemia is caused by a mutation of the DNA in bone marrow stem cells resulting in the abnormal multiplication of leukocytes.  If untreated, surplus leukocytes will overwhelm the bone marrow, enter the bloodstream and eventually invade other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and central nervous system.  In this way, the behavior of leukemia is different from that of other cancers, which usually begin in major organs and ultimately spread to the bone marrow.  Leukemia is an umbrella term covering a large group of cancers.
 Table 1 - Leukemia Subtypes


Type | Subtype | Features 
AcuteLeukemia | Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia(ALL) | Most common among children Five-year survival rate of ~70% 
 | Acute Myelogenous Leukemia(AML) | Most common in adults, especially men Five-year survival rate of ~26% 
Chronic Leukemia | Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL) | Most common in adults above 55 years old, especially menFive-year survival rate of ~85%
 | Chronic Myelogenous Leukemi(CML) | Mainly in adults and rare in childrenFive-year survival rate of ~63% 

All leukemia arises from mutations or damage to the DNA within the blood cells.  These mutations may occur spontaneously or as a result of exposure to radiation or carcinogenic substances.  Ionizing radiation, as well as exposure to chemicals such as benzene, increases the risk of AML, while agricultural chemicals have been linked to an increased incidence of chronic lymphoctic Leukemia (“CLL”).  A weak immune system, some virus forms such as human T-cell Leukemia virus I (“HTLV-1”), genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking, and reactions to some therapeutic drugs are also implicated in the etiology of leukemia.

Diagnosis, Treatment, and Management

The first symptoms of leukemia are often vague and are correlated with other disorders. Common symptoms include fatigue and malaise, excessive bruising, and abnormal bleeding due to low platelet count.  Further symptoms can include weight loss, bone and joint pain, infection and fever, and an enlarged spleen, lymph nodes and liver. After a blood test, several blood abnormalities such as anemia, or leucopenia may be observed, and in most cases a bone marrow test is required to confirm the diagnosis.

The preliminary diagnostic test for leukemia is a blood cell count, which is followed by immune-phenotyping to assess whether the abnormal lymphocyte levels are caused by inflammation or cancer. The physician may also require additional confirmatory tests such as cytogenetic analysis or bone marrow sampling.

The specific variety and combination of anticancer drugs prescribed depends on the form and stage of the disease.  For example, treatment for AML, the most common form of leukemia, usually involves chemotherapy with cytotoxic cytarabine in conjunction with an anthracycline such as daunorubicin or idarubicin. Because of the severity of the cytotoxic treatment, bone marrow transplants (“BMTs”) are sometimes necessary.  By transplanting healthy bone marrow into the body, BMTs help rebuild tissue damaged by the treatment.  Interferon (“INF”) therapy, particularly with INF-alpha, is an alternative or additional treatment offered to almost all newly diagnosed patients in these markets.  However, it is very difficult to cure, even though early treatment indicates it will help people to live longer.

The standard first-line treatment strategy for CLL:  Patients who might not be able to tolerate the side effects of strong chemotherapy (chemo) are often treated with chlorambucil alone or with a monoclonal antibody like rituximab (Rituxan) or obinutuzumab (Gazyva). Other options include ibrutinib (Imbruvica), rituximab alone, or a corticosteroid like prednisone.

In stronger and healthier patients, there are many options for treatment. Commonly used treatments include:

• | FCR: fludarabine (Fludara), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), and rituximab

4


• | Bendamustine (sometimes with rituximab)


• | FR: fludarabine and rituximab


• | CVP: cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (sometimes with rituximab)


• | CHOP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine (Oncovin), and prednisone


• | Chlorambucil combined with prednisone, rituximab, obinutuzumab, or ofatumumab


• | PCR: pentostatin (Nipent), cyclophosphamide, and rituximab


• | Alemtuzumab (Campath)


• | Fludarabine (alone)


• | Ibrutinib (alone)

Other drugs or combinations of drugs may also be also used.  If the only problem is an enlarged spleen or swollen lymph nodes in one region of the body, localized treatment with low-dose radiation therapy may be used. Splenectomy (surgery to remove the spleen) is another option if the enlarged spleen is causing symptoms.

Also, very high numbers of leukemia cells in the blood causes problems with normal circulation. This is called leukostasis. Leukapheresis is also sometimes used before chemo if there are very high numbers of leukemia cells (even when they aren’t causing problems) to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.

On the failure of first line therapy, the standard therapy is usually to administer many of the drugs and combinations listed above as potential second-line treatments. For many people who have already had fludarabine, alemtuzumab seems to be helpful as second-line treatment, but it carries an increased risk of infections. Other purine analog drugs, such as pentostatin or cladribine (2-CdA), may also be tried. Newer drugs such as ofatumumab, ibrutinib, idelalisib (Zydelig), and venetoclax (Venclexta) may be other options.  If these types of chemotherapy fail, the next option is usually a bone marrow transplant.  A stem cell transplant is a third treatment option depending on leukemia response.

Neucleophosmin (NPM1)

As noted above, leukemia arises due to DNA damage or mutations.  Chromosomal aberrations involving NPM1 were found in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute promyelocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and AML. NPM1 has been found in the cytoplasm in patients with primary AML.
NPM1 Roles in Tumorigenesis

NPM1 gene is up-regulated, mutated and chromosomally translocated in many tumor types. NPM1 is transferred from nucleolus to nucleoplasm and cytoplasm by anticancer drugs. When expressed at high level, NPM1 could promote tumor growth by inactivation of tumor suppressor p53/ARF pathway; when expressed at low level, NPM1 could suppress tumor growth by inhibition of centrosome duplication. NPM1 is haplo insufficient in hemizygous mice that are vulnerable to tumor development. NPM1c+ (cytoplasm form) translocation into cytoplasm could serve as an AML remission signal. NPM1 forms a pentamer that could serve as a potential anticancer target.

Our technology (the process of targeting the mutation of the NPM1 gene), is believed to inhibit the NPM1 gene, reducing levels of NPM1 and consequently reducing a tumor cell’s ability to duplicate.  It anticipated that our NPM1 inhibitor will have therapeutic activity in patients with the NPM1 mutation and possibly in the broader NPM1 population.
RASP-101 (ACT D) Program
Falini, Brunetti, and Martelli (N Engl J Med, 2015, 373(12):1180-2) hypothesized that NPM1-mutated AML cells might be vulnerable to a drug like dactinomycin that triggers a nucleolar stress response. In an initial evaluation, a single patient was treated for six cycles of five consecutive daily intravenous doses of 12.5 µg/kg at intervals of 3 to 4 weeks.  Morphologic and immunohistochemical complete remission was evident after the fourth cycle, and an assay for mutant copies of NPMA showed molecular complete remission after the fourth cycle. In a subsequent Phase II clinical trial (EudraCT number 2014-000693-18), completed in two and a half years, patients with refractory or relapsed NPM1-mutated AML were treated with dactinomycin at 15 µg/kg/day in cycles of 5 consecutive days.  A complete response was achieved in 40% of the patients.
We are now developing RASP-101, a formulated dactinomycin product, to enable multi-center clinical studies in patients with NPMI-mutated AML.

Lysine Specific Demethylase -1 (LSD1) Program

In 2012, a paper published in Nature Medicine established that inhibitors of an enzyme involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression known as LSD1 or KDM1A can make drug-insensitive forms of AML responsive to treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). ATRA is used to treat a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but it is normally not effective in non-APL AML because the drug does not cause proper transcriptional activation of retinoic acid receptor target genes.  This is a result of reduced methylation (specifically histone 3lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylation) on the promoter regions of these target genes.  Therefore, the authors of the article hypothesized that inhibiting LSD1 might facilitate ATRA-induced differentiation of AML cells, which is known to halt the division of these cells.  The research highlights a crosstalk between the ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation pathway and H3K4 methylation, and suggests that ATRA combined with LSD1 inhibitors might be therapeutically beneficial in AML.

Working from this premise, Dr. Pelicci’s group has developed novel irreversible and reversible LSD1 regulators which have shown appropriate effect on the LSD1 gene in-vitro and in-vivo efficacy in two AML animal models to facilitate nomination of a lead and then a drug candidate for clinical trials by Rasna. We believe that this breakthrough program may have significant benefits across all forms of leukemia.
Market Potential of NPM1

There are estimated to be approximately 19,000 new AML cases in the United States each year and the projected cost of treatment attributable to drug administrations for each patient over the course of the disease can be estimated at US $100,000 per patient or US $1,900,000,000 in the aggregate from the different treatment cycles.  Of this it is estimated that 50% of the costs will continue to be attributable to standard of care chemotherapy.  Thus, it is estimated that the US market potential for AML is $1 billion annually.  The rest of the world is estimated to constitute 50% of the AML market; thus, the total annual world market is estimated to be $2 billion.  If Rasna’s NPM1 targeted therapy proves beneficial to only that 20% of AML patients with mutated NPM1 genes, the addressable market will be diminished.  However, in that event, Rasna’s NPM1 targeted therapy would then be the only therapy which address that sub-population and may command higher pricing and reimbursement.

Regulation
We operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Public Health Service Act, among others.
The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these laws and regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time-consuming.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, or biologic license applications, or BLAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA/EMA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for each indication for which FDA/EMA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA/EMA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years (typically between 5-7 years post an IND submission) and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practices, or GCP, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs, which are applications for marketing approval, are typically conducted in three sequential Phases, but the Phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the investigational drug candidate into healthy human subjects or patients, the investigational drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks. In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients rather than in healthy volunteers.
If an investigational drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide adequate information for its labeling.
7

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or, in the case of a biologic, a BLA, is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the marketing application is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The marketing application must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of marketing applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within ten months. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA or, in the case of a biologic, the BLA unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the marketing application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the product is safe and effective in the indication studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with FDA’s general biological product standards.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed in a resubmission of the marketing application, the FDA will re-initiate review. If the FDA is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the agency will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. It is not unusual for the FDA to issue a complete response letter because it believes that the drug product is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of approval of the marketing application, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug product’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product’s potential market and profitability. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Once a NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of therapeutic products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.
Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for our product candidates for any other indications or any other product candidate for any indication on a timely basis, if at all.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as product manufacturing, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes.
The federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the Company’s marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Regulation in the European Union
Biologics are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the United States. In the European Union, for example, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of a product in all countries of the European Union, which includes most major countries in Europe. If this procedure is not used, approval in one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the European Union under two simplified application processes, the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure, both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition. After receiving regulatory approval through any of the European registration procedures, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries.
Environmental Laws
We expect to be subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection and the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations may be significant. Our activities as currently planned will require the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials, hazardous materials and chemicals. We will not be able to eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Intellectual Property

In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality, material data transfer agreements, licenses and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We generally protect this information with reasonable security measures.

We intend to file additional patent applications in the US and abroad to strengthen our intellectual property rights. Our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure you that any patents that might issue will protect our technology.

Any patents issued to us in the future may be challenged by third parties as being invalid or unenforceable, or third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that are not covered by our patents. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.

From time to time we may receive notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties’ proprietary rights. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in these actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks or the validity of patents issued to us in the future, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us, or that any assertions of misappropriation, infringement or misuse or prosecutions seeking to establish the validity of our patents will not materially or adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party relating to any patents issued to us in the future or any patents owned by third parties could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties. Furthermore, if we are found to willfully infringe these patents, we could, in addition to other penalties, be required to pay treble damages. Although patent and intellectual property disputes in this area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory or commercially feasible terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to complete our research and development, or such research and development may take considerable time, and force us to reassess our business plans. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from developing our targets, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Several types of existing treatments may be used for people with AML. The main treatments include chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, stem cell transplants and/or interferon therapy. In most cases AML can progress rapidly, so it is important to start treatment as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made. In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late stage clinical development to treat AML. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval.
There are other companies and research institutions working to develop therapies that target AML. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our targets, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. There are many generic products currently on the market for the indications that we are

pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
Employees

Recent Developments
On April 20, 2017, we announced the appointment of Dr. Kunwar Shailubhai as Chief Executive Officer. 
On May 8, 2017, we published the results of Phase II of our NPM1 clinical trial in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Phase II clinical trial was initiated in 2014 and was completed in two and a half years, involved patients with refractory or relapsed NPM1-mutated AML treated with cycles of dactinomycin at a dose of 15µg per kilogram per day for 5 consecutive days. As earlier published, intravenous treatment of refractory or relapsed AML patients with dactinomycin (12.5µg or 15µg per day) for 5 consecutive days had produced hematological complete response in specific patients. We reported an update to these initial findings, which were corroborated by the follow up of a Phase II clinical trial which achieved complete response in 40% of patients.
