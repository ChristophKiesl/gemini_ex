ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and delivering important new medicines to patients for the treatment of cancer. We are leveraging our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform and deep expertise in kinase biology to execute our strategy to develop a broad portfolio of innovative medicines. We have one approved drug, QINLOCK, which was developed through our proprietary platform. Beyond QINLOCK, we are developing three clinical-stage drug candidates and advancing our research-stage programs. We wholly own QINLOCK and all of our drug candidates with the exception of a development and commercialization out-license agreement for QINLOCK in Greater China. We are preparing for a potential launch of QINLOCK in Europe and we have entered, and intend in the future to enter, into select distributor arrangements to offer QINLOCK in geographies where we do not intend to distribute QINLOCK on our own, such as Australia and Canada.
QINLOCK - A Broad spectrum KIT and PDGFRA Inhibitor for GIST
On May 15, 2020, QINLOCK was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. In May 2020, we launched QINLOCK commercially in the U.S. In June 2020, QINLOCK was authorized for sale in Canada by Health Canada for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. In July 2020, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved QINLOCK for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. In November 2020, we announced that we had entered into exclusive distribution agreements for QINLOCK in Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei.
In July 2020, Zai, our licensee for QINLOCK in Greater China, announced that the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) submission for QINLOCK for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. In June 2019, we entered into a License Agreement (the Zai License Agreement), with Zai pursuant to which we granted Zai exclusive rights to develop and commercialize QINLOCK, including certain follow-on compounds (the Licensed Products), in Greater China.
In October 2020, a marketing authorisation application (EU MAA) for QINLOCK in fourth-line GIST was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In January 2021, we announced that the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic) accepted the marketing authorisation application (Swiss MAA) in Switzerland for QINLOCK in fourth-line GIST. We also announced plans to file a marketing authorisation application (U.K. MAA) in the United Kingdom (U.K.) for QINLOCK in fourth-line GIST. In preparation for a potential European approval of QINLOCK, we are actively engaged in building a direct commercial presence in key European markets and building a targeted infrastructure to commercialize QINLOCK, if approved. In January 2021, we also announced commencement of planning efforts for a bridging study for QINLOCK in Japan.
In addition, we are studying QINLOCK in our global pivotal Phase 3 study, INTRIGUE, in second-line GIST patients, comparing QINLOCK to sunitinib. The study is being conducted at 122 investigational sites in 22 countries. We successfully completed enrollment of 453 patients in INTRIGUE and expect to announce top-line results from INTRIGUE in the second half of 2021. We are also studying QINLOCK in an ongoing Phase 1 study in patients with different stages of GIST following treatment with at least one systemic anticancer therapy, such as imatinib. We believe QINLOCK has the potential to play an even broader role than in the fourth-line setting in the treatment of GIST, and we are planning further clinical development to explore this potential.
Beyond QINLOCK, we are developing three clinical-stage drug candidates: vimseltinib (DCC-3014), rebastinib, and DCC-3116.
Vimseltinib (DCC-3014) – CSF1R Kinase Inhibition for Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT)
Vimseltinib is an investigational, orally administered, potent, and highly-selective inhibitor of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). We are currently studying vimseltinib in an open-label Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of vimseltinib in patients with malignant solid tumors as well as patients with TGCT. The dose escalation portion of the study is designed to determine a Phase 2 dose for the expansion portion of the study. Based on the results of the dose escalation study, in November 2020, we announced the selection of a Phase 2 dose and initiated the expansion portion of the study with vimseltinib in patients with symptomatic TGCT not suitable for surgery. We are continuing to enroll TGCT patients in cohort 9 of the dose escalation portion of the study to complete enrollment in this cohort. In November 2020, we also announced updated preliminary data from the ongoing dose escalation portion of the study of vimseltinib in patients with TGCT. We expect to present updated data for vimseltinib in the second half of 2021.
Rebastinib – TIE2 Kinase Inhibition for Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
Rebastinib is a potential first-in-class investigational, orally administered, potent, and selective inhibitor of the TEK tyrosine kinase (TIE2). TIE2 is the receptor for angiopoietins ANG-1 and ANG-2, an important family of vascular growth factors. TIE2 receptors are expressed on endothelial cells and angiogenic macrophages promoting the survival, maturation, and functional integrity of the vasculature and play a key role in regulating tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis. Rebastinib binds potently into the switch pocket of TIE2, stabilizing the inhibitory switch and displacing the activation switch to block TIE2 signaling. We are currently studying rebastinib in two Phase 1b/2 studies in combination with chemotherapy, one with paclitaxel and one with carboplatin. In October 2018, we initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel to assess safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In January 2019, we initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Both studies have two parts. Part 1 of each study was designed to select a combination dose of rebastinib with each chemotherapy agent. Part 2 of each study was designed as a Simon 2-stage design; in Stage 1, the combinations are being evaluated in multiple solid tumor cohorts in up to 18 patients each. If there are more than four responses in a cohort, that cohort is expanded to include up to a total of 33 patients. In January 2020, we selected a Phase 2 dose for, and activated, Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin. In May 2020, we announced that in Part 2 of the study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel, we observed the required number of responses in Part 2, Stage 1 in both the endometrial and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cohorts, triggering the expansion of enrollment in these cohorts. In addition, based on the clinical activity observed in Part 1, we added a cohort for patients with carcinosarcoma in Part 2 of the study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel. We expect to present updated data from the study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel for patients with endometrial cancer in the second quarter of 2021 and for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) in the second half of 2021.
DCC-3116 – ULK Kinase Inhibition for Mutant RAS/RAF Cancers
DCC-3116 is a potential first-in-class investigational potent and selective ULK kinase inhibitor discovered using our novel switch-control kinase inhibitor platform. DCC-3116 is designed to inhibit autophagy, a key tumor survival mechanism in cancer cells, by inhibiting the ULK 1/2 kinases, which have been shown to be the initiating factors that activate autophagy. In January 2021, we announced plans to initiate a Phase 1 study of DCC-3116 in the second quarter of 2021 under our IND for DCC-3116, submitted in the fourth quarter of 2020 and cleared by the FDA.
Discovery Platform – Switch-Control Kinase Inhibition
We believe our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform, supported by our experienced management team, enables us to develop advanced, differentiated kinase inhibitors that may provide significant benefits to patients with cancer. We continue to work on potential new drug candidates for undisclosed targets.
Kinase inhibitors are an important class of cancer therapies. Despite the success of this drug class, there remains a significant opportunity for advanced kinase inhibitors that address the shortcomings of current therapies, including limited durability of response caused by development of resistance mutations and off-target toxicities that limit dose and, consequently, target inhibition. In addition, currently approved kinase inhibitors target fewer than 10% of the over 500 known human kinases. There remains a substantial opportunity to develop novel inhibitors that target therapeutically relevant kinases.
Our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform combines our deep insight into the biology of kinases with our library of drug-like compounds that we designed to interact with specific regions of the kinase regulating switch function. The transformation of a kinase from a switched-off, or inactivated, state to a switched-on, or activated, state is dependent upon the interaction of one region of the kinase called the activation switch with another region called the switch pocket. The interaction 
between the activation switch and the switch pocket is a common mechanism among all kinases; however, the molecular structure of the activation switch and the switch pocket varies among kinases allowing for the rational design of molecules that inhibit a specific kinase or specific kinases. An extension of our platform has been shown to enable the design of switch-control inhibitors for serine/threonine kinases that utilize other kinase domain regions for switch regulation/activation, including the C-helix, P-loop, and catalytic amino acid residues.
Our drug candidates directly target the conformation-controlling switch that kinases rely on for activation and are designed to inhibit the kinase from switching on. By using our proprietary approach to target the switch pocket, we believe we can design inhibitors that are more broadly active against the target kinase, covering both wild-type, or non-mutant, and mutant forms, or that are spectrum-selective against several chosen kinases, all while minimizing off-target toxicity. We believe that our drug candidates may contribute to higher activity than currently available kinase inhibitors even upon accumulation of mutations that would render the kinase resistant to other kinase inhibitors. Our drug candidates bind directly into the switch pocket at the site where the activation switch binds. As a result, the dual inhibitory mechanism of action of our platform is designed to provide broad in vitro inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA kinase activity, including wild type and multiple primary and secondary mutations.
We believe the results observed in patients treated with QINLOCK provide strong evidence of our ability to discover and develop novel potential medicines to meet unmet medical needs using our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform. We designed QINLOCK to inhibit the full spectrum of the known mutant or amplified KIT and PDGFRA kinases that drive cancers such as GIST and believe the positive results from both the Phase 1 study and Phase 3 INVICTUS study demonstrate QINLOCK's differentiated profile. We believe that the rapid clinical development and subsequent FDA approval of QINLOCK, in only four and a half years (from dosing the first patient until receiving FDA approval), highlights our drug development capabilities that we believe will benefit our continued development of QINLOCK as well as the development of our other clinical and research-stage programs.
We have assembled a management team with extensive experience in the discovery, development, and commercialization of cancer therapeutics, including in senior roles at leading pharmaceutical companies. We are supported by our board of directors and specialized scientific advisory boards, who contribute their deep understanding of drug discovery and development, as well as expertise in building public companies and business development. We believe that our team is ideally positioned to leverage our highly differentiated platform to develop and, if approved, commercialize advanced kinase inhibitors that will have significant benefit for patients with cancer.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to discover, develop and deliver important new medicines to patients for the treatment of cancer. The principal components of our strategy include:
•Successfully commercialize QINLOCK in the U.S., and continue to build our global commercial capability as we actively prepare to bring QINLOCK to eligible patients around the world, including in Europe, if approved.
•Expand the market opportunity for QINLOCK through clinical development in second-line GIST and potentially other areas of GIST treatment.
•Continue to develop vimseltinib as a potential single agent therapy for the treatment of TGCT.
•Continue to develop rebastinib as a combination therapy in solid tumor cancers.
•Develop DCC-3116, our ULK kinase inhibitor, for the potential treatment of RAS or RAF mutant cancers.
•Advance our discovery efforts using our switch-control kinase inhibitor platform.
•Evaluate strategic opportunities to accelerate development timelines and maximize the commercial potential of our drug candidates.
•Foster a values-based culture that embraces diversity and advances our patient-focused mission.
Kinases and their Role in Cellular Function
Kinases play an important role in regulating cellular functions and the communication of cells with their environments. When dysregulated, kinases contribute to the development and progression of diseases including cancer and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Despite the success of kinase inhibitors as a drug class, the therapeutic potential of individual kinase inhibitors has been limited by the development of drug resistance and by poor potency and selectivity profiles that lead to off-target toxicities or diminished efficacy. In addition, currently approved kinase inhibitors target fewer than 10% of the over 500 known human kinases. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to develop novel kinase inhibitor therapies.
Within almost all kinases, a molecular control known as the activation switch governs whether the kinase is in the inactive or the active state. Most of the time kinases are in an inactive state and are triggered into the active state when they are needed to direct normal cellular functions. In cancer, mutations within kinases, particularly those that involve the activation switch region, can cause uncontrolled kinase signaling within the cell. In addition, kinases may acquire further mutations during treatment with traditional kinase inhibitors that confer resistance to these kinase inhibitors. We designate the region of the gene that encodes the kinase, or exon, when referring to a particular mutation. Kinase activity also may be amplified through the aberrant development of multiple copies of the relevant gene. These aggressively activated mutated or amplified kinases can drive rapid, uncontrolled growth and spread of tumors. Additionally, wildtype kinases (not mutationally activated) in cancer cells or in various cell types in the tumor microenvironment can be co-opted by tumors or malignancies to enable growth, survival, or metastases.
Our Approach: Switch-Control Kinase Inhibitors
We created our diverse pipeline of drug candidates entirely in-house using our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform. We developed our platform based on our deep insight into the biology of kinases, which are regulated by control of their shape, or conformation. The transformation of a kinase from an inactive to an activated state is dependent upon the interaction of one region of the kinase called the activation switch with another region called the switch pocket. This activation switch mechanism is common among kinases. Some kinases also can be activated if the activity of an inhibitory switch that ordinarily blocks the ability of the activation switch to interact with the switch pocket is diminished or lost. Our drug candidates, which we refer to as switch-control kinase inhibitors, directly interfere with the interaction between the activation switch and the switch pocket and prevent kinase activation. While the interaction between the activation switch and the switch pocket is common among kinases, the molecular structure of the activation switch and the switch pocket varies among kinases. We take advantage of this variation to design molecules that inhibit a specific kinase or kinases. An extension of our platform has been shown to enable the design of switch-control inhibitors for serine/threonine kinases that utilize kinase regions other than the activation loop for switch regulation/activation, including the C-helix, P-loop, or catalytic amino acid residues. This expanded platform enables the design of switch-control inhibitors that bind a kinase in either a Type II state (DFG-out) or a Type I state (DFG-in).
Our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform includes a library of drug-like, switch-control kinase compounds. We have determined and assessed more than 100 co-crystal structures where our compounds are bound into the switch pocket of specific kinases. We use this information to identify and optimize candidate molecules that are specifically designed to interact with the switch pocket. By directly targeting the switch pocket, we believe we can design inhibitors that will be broadly active against the target kinase, covering both wild-type and many or all of the known mutant or amplified forms, or spectrum-selective towards several chosen kinases.
Using our switch-control kinase inhibitor platform, we have developed a diverse pipeline of differentiated, orally administered drug candidates that include three clinical-stage, and ongoing research-stage, programs, in addition to our approved drug, QINLOCK. Our switch-control kinase inhibitors are designed to interact at a molecular level that is distinct from other kinase inhibitors. We believe our drug candidates may contribute to higher activity than currently available kinase inhibitors, including where multiple mutations confer resistance to these other kinase inhibitors. In addition, because our drug candidates are designed to bind directly into the switch pocket or other switch-control regions, we believe mutations in these switch regulating regions that could potentially diminish the activity of our drug candidates are likely to result in a weakly activated or inactive kinase.
The image below illustrates activation of the switch pocket and how our switch-control kinase inhibitors are designed to embed into the switch pocket thereby inhibiting switch activation.

Switched on: Kinase active | Switched off: Kinase inactive

While we believe that our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform offers the benefits described above, there are certain limitations of our platform, including its inability to control inhibition of certain kinases that interfere with access to the switch pocket, including cyclin dependent kinases and specific kinases in the MAP kinase family (MEK and ERK), which constitute less than 10% of the over 500 known human kinases as well as the inability of our laboratory assays to support high-throughput screening, resulting in limitations on the number of molecules that can be screened.
Our Drug and Drug Candidates
We are leveraging our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform to develop a pipeline of highly selective, potent small molecule drug candidates that are designed to directly inhibit activation of kinases implicated in the growth and spread of tumors. Our platform allows us to rapidly identify new drug candidates to enter preclinical development. We wholly own QINLOCK and all of our drug candidates with the exception of a development and commercialization out-license agreement for QINLOCK in Greater China, including the lead programs summarized in the following figure:
QINLOCK: A Broad spectrum KIT and PDGFRA Inhibitor for GIST
QINLOCK is an orally administered switch-control kinase inhibitor developed for the treatment of GIST. While approved kinase inhibitors control certain initiating and drug resistance-causing mutations in KIT and PDGFRA, the kinases that drive disease progression in most GIST patients, these approved drugs fail to inhibit all known mutations. We designed QINLOCK to 
improve the treatment of GIST patients by inhibiting the full spectrum of the known mutations in KIT and PDGFRA. QINLOCK is a KIT and PDGFRA switch-control kinase inhibitor that blocks initiating and resistance KIT mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, and 18 known to be present in GIST patients. QINLOCK similarly inhibits the primary initiating PDGFRA mutations occurring in exons 12 and 18 and also inhibits wild-type PDGFRA that is subject to amplification in cancers.
On May 15, 2020, QINLOCK was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. Following FDA approval of QINLOCK, in May 2020, we commenced sales and marketing of QINLOCK in the U.S.
In June 2020, QINLOCK was authorized for sale in Canada by Health Canada for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. In July 2020, the Australian TGA approved QINLOCK for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. In November 2020, we announced that we had entered into exclusive distribution agreements for QINLOCK in Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei.
In July 2020, Zai, our licensee for QINLOCK in Greater China, announced that the NMPA accepted the NDA submission for QINLOCK for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. In June 2019, we entered into the Zai License Agreement with Zai pursuant to which we granted Zai exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the Licensed Products in Greater China.
In October 2020, an EU MAA for QINLOCK in fourth-line GIST was accepted for review by the EMA. In January 2021, we announced that Swissmedic accepted a Swiss MAA for QINLOCK in fourth-line GIST. We also announced plans to file a U.K. MAA for QINLOCK in fourth-line GIST. In preparation for a potential European approval of QINLOCK, we are actively engaged in building a direct commercial presence in key European markets and building a targeted infrastructure to commercialize QINLOCK, if approved. In January 2021, we also announced commencement of planning efforts for a bridging study for QINLOCK in Japan. We, or our partners, are also pursuing marketing approval of QINLOCK in our other international target markets.
In addition, we are studying QINLOCK in our global pivotal Phase 3 study, INTRIGUE, in second-line GIST patients, comparing QINLOCK to sunitinib. The study is being conducted at 122 investigational sites in 22 countries. We successfully completed enrollment of 453 patients in INTRIGUE. We expect to announce top-line results from INTRIGUE in the second half of 2021 and, if positive, we plan to submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA for approval of QINLOCK for the treatment of second-line GIST patients in the U.S., and similar applications in Europe and other major markets. We are also studying QINLOCK in an ongoing Phase 1 study in patients with different stages of GIST, following treatment with at least one systemic anticancer therapy, such as imatinib. We believe QINLOCK has the potential to play an even broader role than in the fourth-line setting in the treatment of GIST, and we are planning further clinical development to explore this potential.
Market Opportunity in GIST
GIST is the most common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract and is commonly localized to the stomach and small intestine. GIST can occur at any age, but is more common in individuals aged over 50 years. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2020 approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients were newly diagnosed with GIST in the U.S. Estimates for 5-year survival range from 52% to 94% depending upon the stage of the disease at diagnosis.
GIST is a disease driven initially by primary mutations in KIT kinase in approximately 80% of cases or in PDGFRA kinase in approximately 5% to 10% of cases. In approximately 10% to 15% of all GIST patients, the disease is not driven by KIT or PDGFRA but by other genetic mutations or alterations. Primary mutations in the KIT gene are found in exon 11 in approximately 67% of GIST patients, in exon 9 in approximately 10% of GIST patients, and less frequently in exon 13 or 17. Primary mutations in the PDGFRA gene are found in exon 18 (a mutation referred to as D842V being the most frequent) in approximately 6% of GIST patients and more rarely in exon 12. Activation of these kinases caused by primary mutations leads to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and spread.
Metastatic KIT-driven GIST is a disease characterized by many mutations in KIT, with over 90% of individual KIT-driven GIST patients harboring multiple mutations that drive progression of their disease. Multiple secondary mutations can arise within an individual patient and/or tumor in different areas or sites of tumor growth. Drug resistant secondary mutations in patients with KIT-driven GIST span exon regions 13 to 18, and in a recent study, 35% of GIST patients had at least two secondary mutations, each as illustrated below.
The complex heterogeneity of KIT mutations within individual tumors and individual patients is a major cause of resistance to existing therapies, which individually only address a subset of the mutations driving disease progression. A kinase inhibitor that could inhibit a broad spectrum of clinically relevant KIT mutations could be of high therapeutic value in the treatment of KIT-driven GIST in patients who are unresponsive to treatment or have grown resistant to treatment. We believe our design of QINLOCK as a dual switch-control tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of KIT and PDGFRA may make the appearance of secondary mutations less likely after treatment than with a traditional kinase inhibitor.
First-line Treatments For GIST
Patients diagnosed early with localized GIST generally undergo surgical resection of their tumors. In surgically resected patients considered at a high risk of recurrence and in unresectable or metastatic patients, the kinase inhibitor imatinib is the only approved first-line therapy in the U.S., other than avapritinib, which is approved in the U.S. for GIST patients with PDGFRA exon 18 mutations only (estimated to be approximately 6% of all patients with newly-diagnosed GIST). Imatinib is typically prescribed in doses of 400 mg or 800 mg daily. Tumors are usually measured by CT scan and changes in size characterized by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). RECIST criteria define a partial response (PR) as tumor size reduction of 30% or more, a complete response (CR) as tumor size reduced by 100%, and disease progression as an increase in tumor size by 20% or more. RECIST criteria define stable disease (SD) as neither qualifying for PR nor for disease progression. In one Phase 3 trial of GIST patients with unresectable or metastatic disease treated with imatinib, CRs were seen in only about 5% of patients dosed at 400 mg once daily (QD) and aggregate CRs and PRs, which is defined as best tumor response rate, were seen in approximately 45% of these patients. Patients with PDGFRA-driven GIST are mostly insensitive to imatinib and generally fail to respond to therapy. While imatinib generally is well-tolerated, in one clinical study involving patients receiving 400 mg of imatinib daily, 43% experienced one or more grade 3 to 5 adverse events, 16% underwent dose reductions, and 38% interrupted treatment. Among patients treated with 800 mg of imatinib daily, 58% had dose reductions, and 59% had interrupted treatment.
Disease progression in advanced GIST is often due to secondary mutations in KIT or PDGFRA that cause resistance to first-line treatment. Although imatinib is effective against KIT mutations in exon 11 and has some limited efficacy against exon 9 mutations when the dose is increased from 400 mg to 800 mg daily, secondary mutations in KIT in exons 13, 14, 17, and 18 or most primary mutations in PDGFRA confer resistance to imatinib. While more than 80% of GIST patients will see some clinical benefit from imatinib monotherapy, and a small portion of patients have shown progression-free survival (PFS) up to ten years, greater than 50% of patients will develop disease progression by two years, and 90% at ten years. Of the approximately 4,000 to 6,000 GIST patients that are reported as newly diagnosed each year in the U.S., we estimate that about 65% will experience metastatic disease and 90% will receive first-line treatment with imatinib.
Second- and Third-line Treatments For GIST
In KIT-driven GIST patients who progress on imatinib, the clinical goal is stabilization of their disease. Objective responses, as judged by a RECIST-defined decrease in the size of measurable lesions, are rare and increasingly considered on their own to be poor surrogates for clinical benefit in second- and third-line patients. The FDA recognized endpoint for approval of the two approved agents for second- and third-line therapies in GIST was time-to-tumor-progression (TTP) and PFS, respectively. We believe that the rate of disease control, which includes patients with SD and PRs and CRs, is an appropriate 
measure of clinically relevant activity and a likely predictor of PFS and durability of treatment. In GIST patients who progress on imatinib, second-line therapy is typically sunitinib, which was approved in 2006 for patients with GIST who had disease progression following treatment with, or intolerance to, imatinib. Sunitinib has greater activity against mutations in KIT exon 9 compared to imatinib and less activity against mutations in KIT exon 11. Additionally, sunitinib shows activity against KIT exon 13 and 14 mutations, but is not active against mutations in exon 17 and 18. Only about half of GIST patients show benefit on sunitinib therapy and the reported TTP is 6.1 months. Unlike treatment with imatinib in first-line therapy, sunitinib rarely produces CRs or PRs per RECIST (on a confirmed and centrally read basis), as shown by the objective response rate (ORR) of approximately 7%. Approximately 5% to 10% of GIST patients on sunitinib experienced each of the following grade 3 or 4 adverse events: hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, and hand-foot syndrome. In two large retrospective studies of sunitinib in GIST, 20% of patients experienced adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. The emergence of KIT mutations in exon 17 or 18 confers resistance to sunitinib.
In 2013, regorafenib received marketing approval in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with metastatic and unresectable GIST who have experienced disease progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib and sunitinib. In addition to being active against KIT mutations in exon 11, regorafenib was the only approved therapy with activity against a subset of KIT mutations in exon 17, at the time of its approval. However, regorafenib does not inhibit all KIT mutations in exon 17 or 18. The reported median PFS with regorafenib is 4.8 months. Similar to treatment with sunitinib, regorafenib rarely produces CRs or PRs per RECIST as shown by the ORR of approximately 4.5%. Approximately 61% of GIST patients on regorafenib experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event including, hypertension (23%), hand-foot syndrome (20%), and diarrhea (5%). Regorafenib also has shown increased liver toxicity. Liver function tests are recommended prior to initiation of therapy and periodically over the first two months of treatment.
The following table shows reported PFS, ORR, overall survival, all as per RECIST, for imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, and QINLOCK in first-line, second-line, third-line, and fourth-line GIST, respectively, based upon the published results of registrational trials that were presented to the FDA for approval of these drugs.

While imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib inhibit certain clinically relevant initiating and drug resistance-causing mutations in KIT, these approved drugs, in addition to avapritinib, each inhibit only a limited subset of KIT and PDGFRA mutations known to occur in GIST patients. Although GIST patients may experience periods of disease control with these treatments, due to the 
heterogeneous nature of the mutations that drive the disease, many patients continue to progress and ultimately fail all lines of treatment. Of the approximately 4,000 to 6,000 GIST patients newly diagnosed each year in the U.S., we estimate that about 65% will experience metastatic disease. We estimate that the annual new treatment-eligible population of second-line GIST patients in the U.S. is approximately 2,000. We estimate that the annual new treatment-eligible population of third-line GIST patients in the U.S. is approximately 1,400 to 1,600 and we estimate that the annual new treatment-eligible population of fourth-line GIST patients in the U.S. is approximately 1,000 to 1,300. These treatment eligible patient estimates exclude the estimated proportion of patients that die, discontinue treatment, or enter a clinical trial and, therefore, are not eligible for treatment; for later lines of therapy, we expect a similar drop-off rate. These estimates, which are based on our recent analyses of U.S. claims data, are inherently uncertain. We estimate the annual incidence of new patients with GIST to be approximately 4,000 to 6,000 in what is referred to as the EU5, which includes Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. Treatment of GIST patients who are resistant to or intolerant of these approved second- and third-line drugs remains an area of high unmet medical need. In addition, avapritinib is the only currently approved therapeutic option specifically for PDGFRA-driven GIST that potently inhibits D842V mutations, which is the most common PDGFRA mutation. We estimate that the annual incidence of new patients with PDGFRA-driven GIST in the U.S. and in Europe and Japan combined is approximately 400 and 700, respectively. In preclinical assays, QINLOCK is potently active against the D842V mutation and other PDGFRA primary mutations. We believe that QINLOCK may offer a potential treatment for these patients in addition to those patients who failed currently approved kinase inhibitors.
Clinical Development of QINLOCK
Phase 3 INVICTUS Study in Fourth-Line and Fourth-Line Plus GIST
On May 15, 2020, QINLOCK was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. The FDA's approval of QINLOCK was based on our NDA submission in December 2019, which was reviewed under the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) pilot program, Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) and the FDA's Project Orbis initiative, and granted priority review. Our NDA submission was based on positive results from our first Phase 3 study, INVICTUS, in patients with fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST. Following the FDA approval of QINLOCK, in May 2020, we commenced sales and marketing of QINLOCK in the U.S.
In December 2019, we filed a New Drug Submission (NDS) with Health Canada and a market authorisation application (AUS MAA) with the TGA in Australia for QINLOCK in advanced GIST under Project Orbis. Project Orbis is an initiative of the FDA's OCE, and, according to the FDA, provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. According to the FDA, collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions, regardless of whether the product has received FDA approval. In June 2020, QINLOCK was authorized for sale in Canada by Health Canada for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. In July 2020, the TGA approved QINLOCK for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. In November 2020, we announced that we had entered into exclusive distribution agreements for QINLOCK in Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei.
In July 2020, Zai, our licensee for QINLOCK in Greater China, announced that the NMPA accepted the NDA submission for QINLOCK for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib.
In October 2020, an EU MAA for QINLOCK in fourth-line GIST was accepted for review by the EMA. In January 2021, we announced that Swissmedic accepted a Swiss MAA for QINLOCK in fourth-line GIST. We also announced plans to file a U.K. MAA for QINLOCK in fourth-line GIST. In preparation for a potential European approval of QINLOCK, we are actively engaged in building a direct commercial presence in key European markets and building a targeted infrastructure to commercialize QINLOCK, if approved. In January 2021, we also announced commencement of planning efforts for a bridging study for QINLOCK in Japan. We, or our partners, are also pursuing marketing approval of QINLOCK in our other international target markets.
The INVICTUS Phase 3 study is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of QINLOCK compared to placebo in patients with advanced GIST whose previous therapies have included at least imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS based on disease assessment by blinded independent central review (BICR) using modified RECIST 1.1 criteria. The key secondary endpoint is ORR based on BICR. Additional secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), time to progression, time to best response, PFS by investigator assessment, quality of life, and safety.
In the INVICTUS study, QINLOCK demonstrated a median PFS of 6.3 months (27.6 weeks) compared to 1.0 month (4.1 weeks) in the placebo arm and significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 85% (HR of 0.15, 95% Confidence Interval (0.09,0.25), p-value <0.0001) compared to placebo. This PFS benefit was consistent across all assessed patient subgroups.
For the key secondary endpoint of ORR as determined by BICR using modified RECIST, QINLOCK demonstrated an ORR of 9.4% compared with 0% for placebo (p-value=0.0504), which was not statistically significant. As of the cutoff date of May 31, 2019, the median duration of response had not been reached with seven of the eight patients still responding to treatment. All responders had PRs.
QINLOCK also showed a clinically meaningful improvement over placebo in terms of the secondary endpoint of OS (median OS 15.1 months with QINLOCK compared to 6.6 months with placebo, HR = 0.36, 95% Confidence Interval (0.21,0.62), nominal p-value=0.0004). According to the pre-specified hierarchical testing procedure of the endpoints, the hypothesis testing of OS cannot be formally conducted unless the test of ORR is statistically significant. Since statistical significance was not achieved for ORR, the hypothesis testing of OS was not formally performed. The OS data for the placebo arm includes patients taking placebo who, following progression, were crossed-over to QINLOCK treatment.
QINLOCK was generally well tolerated and associated with an acceptable safety profile. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients treated with QINLOCK were alopecia, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, myalgia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, PPES, and vomiting. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 42 patients (49%) on the QINLOCK arm compared to 19 patients (44%) on the placebo arm. Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in greater than 5% of patients in the QINLOCK arm were anemia (9%; n=8), abdominal pain (7%; n=6), and hypertension (7%; n=6). Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in greater than 5% of patients in the placebo arm were anemia (14%; n=6). The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥4%) were increased lipase and decreased phosphate. Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 31% of patients who received QINLOCK. SAEs that occurred in >2% of patients were abdominal pain (4.7%), anemia (3.5%), nausea (2.4%), and vomiting (2.4%).
TEAEs leading to dose reduction occurred in 7% of patients on the QINLOCK arm compared to 2% on the placebo arm. TEAEs leading to dose interruption occurred in 24% of patients on the QINLOCK arm compared to 21% on the placebo arm. TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation occurred in 8% of patients on the QINLOCK arm compared to 12% of patients on the placebo arm. TEAEs leading to death occurred in 6% of patients on the QINLOCK arm compared to 23% on the placebo arm.
Phase 3 INTRIGUE Study in Second-Line GIST
In December 2018, we initiated a pivotal Phase 3 study, INTRIGUE, to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of QINLOCK compared to sunitinib in second-line GIST patients. The study is being conducted at 122 investigational sites in 22 countries. We successfully completed enrollment of 453 patients in INTRIGUE. We expect to announce top-line results for INTRIGUE in the second half of 2021 and, if positive, we plan to submit a supplemental NDA for approval of QINLOCK for the treatment of patients with second-line GIST in the U.S., and similar applications in Europe and other major markets.
The INTRIGUE Phase 3 study is an interventional, randomized, global, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of QINLOCK compared to sunitinib in patients with GIST previously treated with imatinib. Patients are randomized 1:1 to either 150 mg of QINLOCK once daily or 50 mg of sunitinib once daily for four weeks followed by two weeks without sunitinib. The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST. Secondary endpoints as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST include ORR and OS. As an event-driven study, the analysis of the primary endpoint for INTRIGUE will occur once a pre-specified number of events, defined as death or disease progression events based on independent radiologic review using modified RECIST, has occurred.
Ongoing Phase 1 Expansion Study of QINLOCK in GIST
We have an ongoing Phase 1 study of QINLOCK in patients with different stages of GIST following treatment with at least one systemic anticancer therapy, such as imatinib. We completed the dose escalation stage of the Phase 1 study, focused on evaluating the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of QINLOCK, and determined a Phase 2 dose. In the expansion stage, the starting dose for QINLOCK is 150 mg QD. Patients who have disease progression by specified response criteria in the expansion stage may escalate to the higher daily dose (150 mg twice daily (BID)) of QINLOCK after completion of the second cycle. Enrollment in our Phase 1 study is complete and we continue to monitor ongoing patients.
In addition, we believe QINLOCK has the potential to play an even broader role than in the fourth-line setting in the treatment of GIST, and we are planning further clinical development to explore this potential.
We published updated results from our ongoing Phase 1 study of QINLOCK in patients with second-line through fourth-line plus GIST in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in August 2020, and in related releases. These results included data from 142 GIST patients in the escalation and expansion phases of the study receiving 150 mg QD of QINLOCK as the starting dose, which is the dose being administered in our INVICTUS and INTRIGUE registration-enabling studies, as of an August 31, 2019 data cutoff date. The results were consistent with those previously presented at the 2019 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. The table below includes local, investigator-assessed ORR by best response as determined by modified RECIST, median duration of response, and mPFS.

Line of Therapy | 2nd Line (n=31) | 3rd Line (n=28) | ≥4th Line (n=83)

QINLOCK was generally well tolerated and the updated adverse events were consistent with previously presented Phase 1 data in patients with GIST. Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs in greater than 5% of patients were increase in lipase level (n=25; 18%), anemia (n=10; 7%), hypertension (n=8; 6%), and abdominal pain (n=13; 9%). The most frequent (>30%) TEAEs in patients with GIST receiving QINLOCK 150 mg once daily (n=142) were alopecia (n=88; 62%), fatigue (n=78; 55%), myalgia (n=69; 49%), nausea (n=65; 46%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (n=62; 44%), constipation (n=56; 39%), decreased appetite (n=48; 34%), and diarrhea (n=47; 33%).
QINLOCK Mechanism of Action
KIT and PDGFRA are kinases that each contain i) an auxiliary inhibitory switch pocket encoded by KIT exon 11 or PDGFRA exon 12 and ii) a main activation switch within the kinase domain encoded by KIT exons 17 and 18 or PDGFRA exons 18 and 19. These mechanisms carefully regulate cellular kinase activity by controlling kinase conformation in either an "on" or "off" position. Oncogenic kinase mutations predominantly function by disrupting one or more regulatory switch mechanisms, leading to dysregulated function and loss of normal, physiologic conformational control. QINLOCK is a novel switch-control TKI specifically designed to broadly inhibit KIT and PDGFRA kinase signaling through a dual mechanism of action that secures the kinase into an inactive conformation, resulting in inhibition of downstream signaling and cell proliferation.
QINLOCK precisely and durably binds to both the switch pocket region and the activation switch to lock the kinase in the inactive state, preventing downstream signaling and cell proliferation. For one aspect of its dual mechanism of action, portions of QINLOCK mimic the inhibitory switch and occupy the switch pocket, thereby preventing the activation switch's entry. Additionally, other residues on QINLOCK bind to the activation loop, stabilizing it out of the switch pocket and covering the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site, so phosphorylation cannot occur. This dual mechanism of action secures KIT and PDGFRA kinases in their inactive conformations providing broad inhibition of KIT and PDGFRA kinase activity, including wild type and multiple primary and secondary mutations. QINLOCK also inhibits other kinases in vitro, such as PDGFRB, TIE2, VEGFR2, and BRAF.
Vimseltinib: CSF1R Kinase Inhibition for TGCT
Vimseltinib is an investigational, orally administered, potent, and highly-selective switch-control kinase inhibitor of CSF1R. Vimseltinib was designed to selectively bind to the CSF1R switch pocket. It has greater than 100-fold selectivity for CSF1R over the closely related kinases FLT3, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and VEGFR2 and has an even greater selectivity for CSF1R over approximately 300 other human kinases that we tested. Vimseltinib inhibits CSF1R signaling in cellular assays, as well as blocks macrophage-mediated tumor cell migration, osteoclast differentiation, and proliferation of a CSF1R-dependent cell line.
We are currently studying vimseltinib in an open-label Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of vimseltinib in patients with malignant solid tumors as well as patients with TGCT. The dose escalation portion of the study is designed to determine a Phase 2 dose for the expansion portion of the study. Based on the results of the dose escalation portion 
of the study, in November 2020, we announced the selection of a Phase 2 dose and initiated the expansion portion of the study with vimseltinib in patients with symptomatic TGCT not suitable for surgery. We are continuing to enroll TGCT patients in cohort 9 of the dose escalation portion of the study to complete enrollment of this cohort. In November 2020, we also announced updated preliminary data from the ongoing dose escalation portion of the study of vimseltinib in patients with TGCT. We expect to present updated data for vimseltinib in the second half of 2021.
Market Opportunity in TGCT
TGCTs are a group of benign tumors that involve the synovium, bursae, and/or tendon sheath. Although benign, these tumors can grow and cause damage to surrounding tissues and structures inducing pain, swelling, and limitation of movement of the joint. A genetic translocation in certain cells within the tumor causes overproduction of CSF1, the ligand for the CSF1R receptor, triggering migration of inflammatory cells including CSF1R-expressing tumor-associated macrophages to tumor sites. Surgery is the main treatment option; however, these tumors tend to recur in approximately 45% of patients with diffuse-type TGCT and 10% of patients with localized TGCT. If untreated or if the tumor continually recurs, damage and degeneration may occur in the affected joint and surrounding tissues, which may cause significant disability. TGCT typically occurs in people 30-50 years old and patient burden most commonly includes pain, joint stiffness, restricted mobility, joint damage, and negative impact on quality of life.
TGCTs are divided into types based on where they are and how they grow. Localized TGCT are typically more well-defined and confined to a portion of smaller joints like the fingers, toes, knees, wrists, and ankles. In 2017, annual incidence of new localized TGCT cases in the U.S. is estimated to be approximately 13,000. Diffuse-type TGCT are typically less well-defined and occur most commonly in and around larger joints such as the knee, hips, ankles, elbows, and shoulders. In 2017, annual incidence of new diffuse-type TGCT cases in the U.S. is estimated to be approximately 1,300.
CSF1R inhibition has demonstrated promising clinical benefit in TGCT patients and we believe that despite an approved treatment for TGCT patients in the U.S., there remains an unmet medical need for this population. Pexidartinib is the only approved product for TGCT patients with symptomatic TGCT associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amenable to improvement with surgery. In a randomized Phase 3 trial, the proportion of patients who achieved ORR was higher for pexidartinib, at 38%, versus placebo, at 0%, at week 25 by RECIST, version 1.1. The FDA approval includes a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for pexidartinib, including intensive liver monitoring due to hepatotoxicity risks, thought to be an off-target effect. The EMA adopted the decision of refusal of the pexidartinib EU MAA in November 2020.
Ongoing Phase 1/2 Study of Vimseltinib in Patients with TGCT
The dose escalation portion of our Phase 1/2 study is a single arm study of vimseltinib that is designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and PD of multiple doses of vimseltinib in approximately 60 patients with malignant solid tumors and symptomatic TGCT patients not amenable to surgery. The dose escalation portion of the study was designed to determine the Phase 2 dose and the MTD using a 3+3 dose escalation design with a minimum of three patients enrolled in each dose level cohort; starting at a dose of 10 mg once daily. Loading doses administered in the second cohort and subsequent cohorts were based on PK profiles observed in the first cohort. Based on the results from the dose escalation portion of the study, in November 2020, we announced the selection of a Phase 2 dose for, and initiated, the expansion portion of the study in patients with symptomatic TGCT not amenable to surgery. We are continuing to enroll TGCT patients in cohort 9 of the dose escalation portion of the study to complete enrollment of this cohort. The expansion portion of the study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary antitumor activity, PK, PD, and patient reported outcomes of vimseltinib in TGCT.
In November 2020, at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society 2020 Virtual Annual Meeting, we announced the presentation of preliminary, updated data from the ongoing dose escalation portion of the Phase 1/2 study of vimseltinib in patients with symptomatic TGCT not amenable to surgery. Safety, PK, and PD data were analyzed as of September 23, 2020, with anti-tumor activity data reported as of October 5, 2020. Tumor reductions from baseline were determined by independent central radiologic review using RECIST. As of the data cut-off date, increasing doses of vimseltinib were assessed in three dose cohorts across 25 patients with TGCT. Each dose cohort received a three to five day loading dose regimen at doses of up to 30 mg followed by a schedule of daily, or twice-weekly maintenance dosing with vimseltinib.
Vimseltinib was generally well-tolerated in patients with TGCT not amenable to surgery. TEAEs occurring in greater than or equal to 15% of patients, regardless of relatedness, were generally grade 1 or 2 and included blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased (52%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (44%), periorbital edema (44%), fatigue (40%), lipase increased (32%), alanine aminotransferase increased (28%), amylase increased (24%), face edema (24%), headache (24%), pruritis (24%), nausea (20%), rash maculo-papular (20%), arthralgia (16%), diarrhea (16%), myalgia (16%), and peripheral edema (16%). Among the TEAEs that occurred in greater than or equal to 15% of patients, grade 3 or 4 related TEAEs occurred in 9 
patients and included grade 3/4 blood CPK increased (20%), grade 3 AST increase (12%), grade 3 lipase increased (12%), grade 3 amylase increased (4%), grade 3 diarrhea (4%) and grade 3 myalgia (4%). No SAEs related to vimseltinib were reported in the TGCT patients. TEAEs led to dose interruption in nine TGCT patients (36%), dose reduction in four TGCT patients (16%), and treatment discontinuation in one TGCT patient (4%) due to an adverse event of asymptomatic grade 3 AST elevation from grade 1 at baseline. Bilirubin levels were within the normal limit and observed transaminase and pancreatic enzyme elevations were asymptomatic and not clinically significant in the TGCT patients.
Similar steady state PK profiles were observed between the 30 mg twice weekly (cohort 5) and 10 mg daily (cohort 8) dosing regimens; lower exposure was observed in the 6 mg daily (cohort 9) dosing regimen. We observed on-target PD inhibition by vimseltinib of CSF1R by causing a dose-related rise in plasma CSF1 and IL-34 and a reduction of CD14dim/CD16+ monocytes in peripheral blood across all TGCT cohorts in this study.
Of the 25 TGCT patients treated as of the data analyses dates, 22 were evaluable for anti-tumor activity by RECIST, 21 by central assessment and one by local assessment. Three of the 25 TGCT patients had not yet reached the first efficacy assessment timepoint. Nine patients, or 41%, across all TGCT cohorts achieved objective response, including one CR (confirmed) and eight PRs (two confirmed and six to be confirmed at future follow up). Seven of the nine responders, or 78%, had a PR at their first restaging scan evaluation. Two of the TGCT patients were on treatment for over 12 months, with responses that deepened over time. At the time of the data cut-off, 22 of 25 patients were receiving treatment with vimseltinib, two patients withdrew from the study and one patient discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.
Based on these results, the Phase 1/2 study of vimseltinib is ongoing and enrolling up to 60 patients in two expansion cohorts, one for TGCT patients with no prior exposure to anti-CSF1/CSF1R agents (n=40) and a second for TGCT patients with prior exposure to anti-CSF1/CSF1R agents (n=20). In addition, enrollment of an additional six patients in cohort 9 of the dose escalation portion of the study is ongoing to complete enrollment in this cohort. The recommended Phase 2 dose for vimseltinib in asymptomatic TGCT patients not amenable to surgery was determined to be 30 mg BID (no loading dose).
Selectivity and Preclinical Profile of Vimseltinib
We evaluated the selectivity of vimseltinib for CSF1R in a standard biochemical assay, called a kinome screen assay. The kinome screen assay assesses the concentrations of vimseltinib at which it inhibits CSF1R and other kinases. We conducted this assay in the presence of ATP. ATP is essential for kinase activation, and the presence of higher concentrations of ATP increases the activity of kinases. The potency of traditional kinase inhibitors is often highly sensitive to increased ATP.
The kinome screen assay uses a 10 micromolar concentration of ATP, a standard low concentration typically used in this assay. Kinases inhibited in the kinome screen assay were then assessed in a separate biochemical assay using a 4 millimolar concentration of ATP, equivalent to that present in human cells. The following figure depicts the results of these assays. Each kinase in the assay is depicted as a point at the end of a branch in the figure, and each kinase inhibited by vimseltinib is depicted as a red dot and listed in the key to the figure. IC50 values are depicted by the size of the dots, where larger dots reflect greater potency for a given kinase while smaller dots reflect lesser potency. As shown below, vimseltinib inhibits CSF1R at concentrations much lower than the concentrations at which it inhibits other kinases. Selective inhibition of CSF1R was more 
pronounced at the higher concentrations of ATP typically found in human cells. The increase in selectivity is a feature of kinase switch-control inhibition, which is not affected by high ATP concentration for targeted kinases.
Vimseltinib (DCC-3014) Exhibits High Selectivity for CSF1R in Kinase Assays
Rebastinib: TIE2 Kinase Inhibition for Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
Rebastinib is a potential first-in-class investigational, orally administered, potent, and selective inhibitor of the TIE2 kinase. TIE2 is the receptor for angiopoietins ANG-1 and ANG-2, an important family of vascular growth factors. TIE2 receptors are expressed on endothelial cells and angiogenic macrophages promoting the survival, maturation, and functional integrity of the vasculature and play a key role in regulating tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis. Rebastinib binds potently into the switch pocket of TIE2, stabilizing the inhibitory switch and displacing the activation switch to block TIE2 signaling.
Market Opportunity in Endometrial and Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancers
Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the inner lining of the uterus. Most endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas. In 2020, annual incidence of new cases of endometrial cancer in women in the U.S. was estimated to be approximately 65,000, with approximately 12,500 women dying from the disease. Overall five-year survival exceeds 80%. However, survival in advanced disease is significantly worse, at approximately 17%. Diagnosed early, surgery with or without radiation may be curative. However, for recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer cases that require systemic therapy, outcomes decline substantially with successive lines of therapy.
Advanced disease is typically treated with platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line setting with paclitaxel and carboplatin doublet. Subsequent lines of therapy are comprised of a diverse range of therapies, including a combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib. The majority of late-stage product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of endometrial cancer is made up of anti-PD1, or programmed cell death protein 1, monoclonal antibodies in combination with chemotherapy, or TKI-based regimens. We believe that, given the significantly reduced success in treating advanced cases of endometrial cancer, and the limited treatment options for patients with advanced disease, there remains an unmet medical need for this population.
Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the ovaries. Cancer that responds at first to treatment with drugs that contain the metal platinum, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, but then recurs within a certain period is considered platinum resistant. In 2020, annual incidence of new cases of ovarian cancer in women in the U.S. was estimated to be approximately 22,000, with approximately 14,000 women dying from the disease. The overall five-year survival rate is approximately 47% in the U.S., but only approximately 29% for metastasized disease. The vast majority of patients experience disease recurrence, and eventually develop PROC.
Platinum-free chemotherapy, such as weekly paclitaxel, topotecan, or liposomal doxorubicin, with the option of adding bevacizumab, is typically the first therapy used for platinum-resistant patients. Due to the limited efficacy of current treatment options, there is no widely accepted standard of care for patients who recur. Therapy is selected on an individualized basis and participation in clinical trials is recommended. There are approximately 50 compounds in Phase 1 to Phase 3 development for the treatment of ovarian cancer. More than 75% in Phase 2/3 are combination regimens. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors and anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1, or programmed death-ligand 1, therapies are widely used across lines of therapy and combinations. Somewhat less widely used are product candidates designed to affect tumor vasculature and/or tumor microenvironment. We believe that because outcomes are particularly poor for patients with PROC, there remains a significant unmet medical need for this population.
Ongoing Phase 1b/2 Studies of Rebastinib in Combination with Chemotherapy
Rebastinib is currently in clinical development for the treatment of multiple solid tumors in combination with chemotherapy in two Phase 1b/2 studies, one with paclitaxel and one with carboplatin.
In October 2018, we announced that we initiated an open-label, multicenter, two-part Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel to assess safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Part 1 of this study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of 50 mg and 100 mg rebastinib BID when administered in combination with paclitaxel, and to determine the Phase 2 dose of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapies. Part 2 of the study was designed as a Simon 2-stage design; in Stage 1, the combination of rebastinib and paclitaxel is being evaluated in multiple solid tumor cohorts in up to 18 patients each. If there are more than four responses in a cohort, that cohort is expanded to include up to a total of 33 patients.
Rebastinib in Combination with Paclitaxel
In Part 1 of the study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel, we observed anti-tumor activity across multiple tumor types including a best response of PR in 5 of 24 patients at 50 mg BID and 3 of 19 patients at 100 mg BID. Objective responses were seen in 8 patients, including 3 PRs in PROC. In Part 2 of the study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the Phase 2 dose of rebastinib in combination with weekly paclitaxel is being assessed across multiple cohorts, including: endometrial cancer, PROC, carcinosarcoma, and breast cancer. This study enrolled 43 evaluable patients in Part 1 and will enroll up to 132 evaluable patients in Part 2. In May 2020, we announced that in Part 2 of the study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel, we observed the required number of responses in Part 2, Stage 1 in both the endometrial and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cohorts, triggering the expansion of enrollment in these cohorts. In addition, based on the clinical activity observed in Part 1, we added a cohort for patients with carcinosarcoma in Part 2 of the study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel. Enrollment is ongoing in Part 2, Stage 1 of the carcinosarcoma and inflammatory breast cancer cohorts of the study. The triple negative breast cancer cohort of the study did not advance to Part 2, Stage 2.
Endometrial Cancer Cohort
In May 2020, we presented preliminary data from Part 2 of the endometrial cancer cohort at the 2020 ASCO Virtual Scientific Program. As of the data cutoff date, a total of 21 patients initiated treatment with rebastinib in the Part 2 cohort of endometrial cancer patients. Median duration of treatment was 3.7 months. Sixteen patients were treated at a starting dose of 100 mg of rebastinib BID in combination with weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 and five patients at a starting dose of 50 mg of rebastinib 
21


BID in combination with weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2. Three of the 21 patients withdrew consent early, resulting in 18 patients in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population. Of the 21 patients treated with the combination, all received one or more prior lines of the combination of paclitaxel/carboplatin, and 20 of 21 received two or more prior anti-cancer regimens. Of the 18 patients included in the mITT population, seven PRs were observed (four confirmed) and six patients had SD, for an ORR of 39% (confirmed and unconfirmed) and a clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, or SD per RECIST, of 72% at eight weeks. Treatment with rebastinib 50 mg BID in combination with paclitaxel was well-tolerated, with TEAEs consistent with findings from Part 1 of the study and consistent with first-in-human studies of rebastinib, or known to be associated with treatment with paclitaxel. The majority of TEAEs occurring in greater than or equal to 15% of patients, regardless of causality, were grade 2 or less. SAEs at least possibly related to rebastinib occurred only in patients treated with rebastinib 100 mg BID and resolved after dose reductions. Nine patients experienced SAEs at least possibly related to rebastinib including muscular weakness (n=2), acute myocardial infarction (n=1), atrial flutter (n=1), dehydration (n=1), head discomfort (n=1), nausea (n=1), peripheral edema (n=1), and pneumonia (n=1). Enrollment in Part 2, Stage 2 of the endometrial cohort at the rebastinib 50 mg BID dose has been completed and further efficacy and safety evaluation is ongoing.
We expect to present updated data from the study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel for patients with endometrial cancer in the second quarter of 2021.
PROC Cohort
At the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO 2020) meeting in September 2020, we presented preliminary data from 29 patients from the PROC expansion cohort in Part 2 of the study comprised of 19 patients treated with rebastinib 50 mg oral BID in combination with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV and 10 patients from the rebastinib 100 mg oral BID with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV. Preliminary results from 24 of the 29 patients that met the mITT criteria included nine PRs and 12 SDs for an ORR of 38% (confirmed and unconfirmed) and a CBR of 88% at eight weeks. Median treatment duration for the mITT population was 4.2 months. In addition, 59% of patients who were evaluable had a CA-125 response, as defined by the Gynecological Cancer Intergroup CA-125 criteria.
Treatment with rebastinib 50 mg BID in combination with paclitaxel was generally well-tolerated, with TEAEs consistent with findings from Part 1 of the study and consistent with the first-in-human study of rebastinib, or known to be associated with treatment with paclitaxel. TEAEs occurring in greater than or equal to 25% of patients, regardless of causality were fatigue (41%), dry mouth (38%), nausea (34%), diarrhea (31%), stomatitis (31%), abdominal pain (28%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (28%). 11 patients (38%) had a TEAE of grade 3 or more. Two patients experienced SAEs at least possibly related to rebastinib including muscular weakness/fatigue (starting dose 100 mg BID and resolved with drug interruption), and urinary tract infection (starting dose rebastinib 50 mg BID). Enrollment in Part 2, Stage 2 of the PROC cohort at the rebastinib 50 mg BID dose has been completed and further efficacy and safety evaluation is ongoing.
We expect to present updated data from the study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel for patients with PROC in the second half of 2021.
Rebastinib in Combination with Carboplatin
In January 2019, we announced that we initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Part 1 (3+3 dose escalation) of this two-part study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of 50 mg and 100 mg rebastinib BID when administered in combination with carboplatin, and to determine the Phase 2 dose of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapies. In Part 2, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the Phase 2 dose of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin administered once every three weeks is being assessed across multiple solid tumor cohorts. This study was designed to enroll up to 117 patients in total, with approximately 18 patients in Part 1 and up to 99 patients in Part 2. We have completed Part 1, selected a Phase 2 dose of 50 mg BID of rebastinib and activated Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin. Enrollment in Part 2, Stage 1 of the platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer cohort at the rebastinib 50 mg BID dose has been completed and efficacy and safety evaluation is ongoing. The triple negative breast cancer and mesothelioma cohorts of the study did not advance to Part 2, Stage 2.
At ESMO 2020, we presented preliminary data from Part 1 of the study of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin. Rebastinib in combination with carboplatin was generally well-tolerated. The majority of TEAEs were grade 1 and grade 2. One patient (rebastinib 50 mg BID) experienced a rebastinib-related SAE (grade 2 retinal vascular disorder). Based on a higher observed frequency of reversible muscular weakness in preliminary data from the ongoing Part 2 portion of the study phase at rebastinib 100 mg BID, the recommended Phase 2 dose was changed to rebastinib 50 mg BID + carboplatin AUC5 Q3W. The clinical benefit rate, defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, or SD per RECIST, was 50% at 
six weeks and 36% at twelve weeks, and the median duration of treatment was 7.8 weeks. One patient (4.5%) had a PR (unconfirmed) and 10 patients (46%) had SD as best response in this heterogeneous, heavily-treated population where all patients received at least two or more prior anti-cancer regimens and 50% received four or more prior regimens. At the rebastinib 50 mg BID dose level, the exposure of rebastinib was generally comparable to previously published data. Mean circulating Ang-2 levels increased after eight days of treatment for all doses, indicating TIE2 inhibition. The Part 2 portion of the Phase 1b/2 study is ongoing and will evaluate the safety and efficacy of rebastinib at the recommended Phase 2 dose in combination with carboplatin.
Selectivity and Preclinical Profile of Rebastinib
We evaluated the selectivity of rebastinib for TIE2 in a kinome screen assay. The kinome screen assay assesses the concentrations of rebastinib at which it inhibits TIE2 and other kinases. Rebastinib has greater than 100-fold selectivity for TIE2. The following figure depicts the results of the kinome screen assay using a 10 micromolar concentration of ATP, a standard low concentration typically used in this assay, followed by further testing of kinase inhibition at a concentration of 4 mM ATP, approximating cellular levels of ATP. Each kinase in the assay is depicted as a point at the end of a branch in the figure, and each kinase inhibited by rebastinib is depicted as a red dot and listed in the legend to the figure.
DCC-3116: ULK Kinase Inhibition for Mutant RAS/RAF Cancers
In January 2021, we announced our plans to initiate a Phase 1 study of DCC-3116 in the second quarter of 2021 under our IND for DCC-3116, submitted in the fourth quarter of 2020 and cleared by the FDA. The Phase 1 multicenter, open-label study will evaluate DCC-3116 as a single agent and in combination with trametinib, an FDA approved MEK inhibitor, in patients with advanced or metastatic tumors with a documented RAS or RAF mutation who have progressed despite standard therapies, or for whom conventional therapy is not considered effective or tolerable, as judged by the investigator. The study will be conducted in two parts, a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. In Part 1, we will start with a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Once the recommended Phase 2 dose or maximum tolerated dose of single agent DCC-3116 is determined, the first cohort of the combination dose escalation will open for enrollment. The dose expansion phase, Part 2, will be initiated after the recommended Phase 2 dose of the combination is determined, and is expected to include four cohorts of up to 20 patients each. This includes cohorts for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma 
harboring a specified, documented mutation in the RAS or RAF pathway. DCC-3116, discovered using our novel switch-control kinase inhibitor platform, is designed to inhibit autophagy by inhibiting the ULK 1/2 kinases, which have been shown to be the initiating factors that activate autophagy.
Mechanism of Action and Preclinical Profile of DCC-3116
DCC-3116 has been designed to treat cancer patients in combination with RAS/MAP kinase signaling pathway inhibition, particularly in patients with RAS or BRAF mutations. Autophagy is a cellular pathway that has been observed to be upregulated in mutant RAS and mutant RAF cancers and is also known to mediate resistance to inhibitors of the RAS/MAP kinase signaling pathway. Autophagy is a survival pathway in which cells respond to stress by recycling their own components and/or clearing damaged organelles and proteins from the cell. Mutant RAS and RAF cancers are reported to have high basal levels of autophagy, which these cancers use to maintain nutrient supply, and regulate cancer cell metabolism and survival. Cellular studies in mutant RAS and RAF cancers have also demonstrated that treatment with MAP kinase pathway inhibitors, as well as other signaling pathway inhibitors, can also induce autophagy as a compensatory survival mechanism. Such induction is seen with RAF, MEK, and ERK inhibitors as well as with direct inhibitors of mutant KRAS G12C. In in vitro and in vivo models of mutant RAS and RAF cancers, inhibition of autophagy combined with inhibition of RAS/MAP kinase signaling using MEK inhibitors, ERK inhibitors, or KRAS G12C inhibitors, has demonstrated synergistic anti-proliferative activity and induction of cell killing. In vivo studies conducted by independent research groups have also demonstrated synergistic anti-tumor activity in various mutant RAS and RAF cancer models.
In our preclinical studies, we have observed DCC-3116 to durably and potently inhibit autophagy in RAS or RAF mutant cancer cell lines through the inhibition of ULK 1/2 kinases. Our in vitro studies have also demonstrated that DCC-3116 in combination with inhibitors of the MAP kinase pathway inhibits both basal autophagy (autophagy in the absence of a MAP kinase pathway inhibitor) and also MAP kinase pathway inhibitor-induced increased autophagy in various mutant RAS or RAF cancer cell lines as illustrated in the graphs below. Autophagy inhibition by DCC-3116 was monitored by the decrease in phosphorylation of the cellular ULK autophagy substrate ATG13 in the presence of the MEK inhibitor trametinib.
Preclinical Inhibition of ULK 1/2 Kinases by DCC-3116 in Multiple RAS/RAF Cancer Cell Lines
When evaluated in preclinical in vivo models, DCC-3116 in combination with inhibitors of the MAP kinase pathway demonstrated synergistic inhibition of mutant RAS or mutant RAF cancer growth as shown below. In KRAS mutant pancreatic, lung, and BRAF mutant melanoma in vivo models, DCC-3116 in combination with trametinib reduced tumor size as compared to 
the control cohort or either single agent treatment cohort. In addition, DCC-3116 in combination with binimetinib and ulixertinib showed a decrease in pancreatic tumor growth as compared to the control cohort or either single agent treatment cohort.
DCC-3116, in Combination with MEK Inhibitor, Trametinib, Inhibited Pancreatic, Lung, and Melanoma Xenograft Tumor Growth
DCC-3116, in Combination with MEK Inhibitor Binimetinib or ERK inhibitor Ulixertinib, Decreased Pancreatic Xenograft Tumor Growth
As an inhibitor of ULK 1/2 kinases, DCC-3116 has been designed to address mutant RAS and mutant RAF cancers by inhibiting the basal and compensatory autophagy that mutant RAS and mutant RAF cancer cells use for survival.
Platform Development and Preclinical Pipeline
We intend to leverage our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform to advance additional drug candidates into clinical development. Our discovery programs are focused on kinases critical to autophagy and cancer cell metabolism and kinases known to selectively drive cancer cell growth and survival. We are advancing the preclinical development of additional programs and expect to initiate further preclinical studies in one of these programs.
Out-License of QINLOCK in Greater China
In June 2019, we entered into the Zai License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Zai exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the Licensed Products in Greater China, also referred to as the Territory. We retain exclusive rights to, among other things, develop, manufacture, and commercialize the Licensed Products outside the Territory. In July 2020, Zai announced that the NMPA accepted the NDA submission for QINLOCK for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib.
Pursuant to the terms of the Zai License Agreement, we received an upfront cash payment of $20.0 million and became eligible to receive up to $185.0 million in potential development and commercial milestone payments, consisting of up to $50.0 million of development milestones and up to $135.0 million of commercial milestones. In addition, during the term of the Zai License Agreement, Zai will be obligated to pay us tiered percentage royalties ranging from low to high teens on potential annual net sales of the Licensed Products in the Territory, subject to adjustments in specified circumstances.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Zai License Agreement, Zai will be responsible for conducting the development and commercialization activities in the Territory related to the Licensed Products.
In February 2020, we entered into a Supply Agreement (the Zai Supply Agreement) with Zai, as required by terms in the Zai License Agreement, pursuant to which we will supply the Licensed Products to Zai for use in the Territory for clinical trials as well as commercial inventory, if QINLOCK obtains regulatory approval in the Territory. Subject to the Zai Supply Agreement, costs incurred by us for external manufacturing services are reimbursed by Zai.

In addition, we may terminate the Zai License Agreement under specified circumstances if Zai or certain other parties challenge our patent rights or if Zai or its affiliates do not conduct certain development activities with respect to one or more Licensed Products for a specified period of time, subject to specified exceptions. Either party may terminate the Zai License Agreement for the other party's uncured material breach of a material term of the Zai License Agreement, with a customary notice and cure period, or insolvency. After termination (but not natural expiration), we are entitled to retain a worldwide and perpetual license from Zai to exploit the Licensed Products. On a region-by-region and a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, upon the natural expiration of the Zai License Agreement as described above, the licenses granted by us to Zai under the Zai License Agreement in such region with respect to the Licensed Product become fully paid-up, perpetual, and irrevocable.
Commercial Operations
For QINLOCK, we have established our own commercial and marketing organization in the U.S. and intend to establish a direct commercial presence in key European markets and build a targeted infrastructure to commercialize QINLOCK in Europe, if approved. In addition, we have entered into distributor arrangements in Australia and Canada, and intend in the future to enter into additional select distributor arrangements to offer QINLOCK to geographies where we do not intend to distribute QINLOCK on our own, or to selectively establish partnerships, such as the Zai license for Greater China described above, in other markets outside the U.S. In the U.S., we have built a specialist sales force to target physicians who are high prescribers of treatments for GIST. Our sales force is supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group, and distribution support. Additionally, our sales and marketing teams manage relationships with key accounts such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, hospital systems, physician group networks, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure in Europe, we expect to invest financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to approval of QINLOCK in Europe, which we may never obtain.
For our drug candidates, we intend to retain commercialization rights in the U.S. and Europe and leverage our commercial and marketing organization for QINLOCK, with appropriate additions or modifications as necessitated by the specific indications pursued, assuming we obtain regulatory approval for such drug candidates in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we will consider entering into relationships with strategic partners that enable the expansion of the ongoing clinical development and/or licenses for development and commercialization or distribution in geographies where we do not intend to distribute QINLOCK on our own, while retaining significant value for our shareholders. These pharmaceutical company partnerships could focus on specific patient populations and their caregivers, on regional development, or on distribution and sales.
Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We produce limited quantities of drug substance for evaluation in our research programs. We currently rely on third parties to manufacture our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for the commercial manufacture of our current and any future drugs. To date, we have obtained drug substance and drug product from third-party manufacturers for QINLOCK, vimseltinib, rebastinib, and DCC-3116 to support preclinical and clinical testing and commercial supply of QINLOCK. We have only limited supply arrangements in 
place with respect to our drug candidates and sole source supplier arrangements for our commercial supply of drug substance and finished drug product for QINLOCK. We acquire many key materials on a purchase-order basis. While we have commercial supply arrangements for our drug substance and finished drug product for QINLOCK, we do not have any long-term supply arrangements in place with respect to our drug candidates and other materials. Furthermore, we do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source of drug substance or drug product. We rely on our sole source suppliers to manufacture all of our drug substance and finished drug product for commercialization of QINLOCK unless and until we add additional sources. We do not currently have a validated manufacturing process in place for any drug candidate, other than our approved drug, QINLOCK, which would be required to support commercialization of any of our drug candidates, if approved.
QINLOCK and all of our drug candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. As drug substances, they can be manufactured from readily available or custom synthesized starting materials in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes that are amenable to scale-up. Some, including QINLOCK, may require specialized processing to optimize performance of the drug product. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize, including QINLOCK, will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future.
We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other related markets that address inhibition of kinases in cancer and other rare genetic diseases. There are other companies working to develop therapies in the field of kinase inhibition for cancer and other diseases. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes.
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing and selling approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management, and sales and marketing personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are approved for broader indications or patient populations, are approved for specific sub-populations, are more convenient, or are less expensive than QINLOCK or any other drugs that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA, or other marketing approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products are currently on the market for some of the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. We expect that QINLOCK, and any of our drug candidates that achieve marketing approval, will be priced at a significant premium over any competitive generic products.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of QINLOCK and all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
QINLOCK, and the drug candidates in our priority programs, if we receive approval for the indications we are targeting, will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs that are currently in clinical trials.
Competition for QINLOCK
On May 15, 2020, QINLOCK was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. In addition, QINLOCK is currently being investigated in a Phase 3 study for the treatment of patients with second-line GIST.
In GIST, the current approved standards of care for unresectable or metastatic patients are first-line imatinib, followed by second-line sunitinib upon imatinib progression, followed by third-line regorafenib upon sunitinib progression. In addition, avapritinib was approved by the FDA in January 2020 for patients with GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation only. In addition, there are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer that would be competitive with QINLOCK, if such drug candidates are approved. Many of these companies are developing cancer therapeutics that are also kinase inhibitors. Although there are currently marketed drugs that have activity in GIST through their targeting of primary and secondary KIT mutants, other than avapritinib for GIST PDGFRA exon 18 mutations only, no currently marketed drug directly targets certain secondary resistance mutations in KIT and PDGFRA, and no currently marketed drug provides coverage of all KIT and PDGFRA mutants. 
With respect to QINLOCK, there are several large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies marketing small molecule drugs or biologic drugs for the treatment of GIST, including Blueprint Medicines Corporation (Blueprint), Novartis AG (Novartis), Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer), and Bayer AG (Bayer). We are also aware of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing drugs for the treatment of GIST including AB Sciences S.A. (ABS), Arog Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Arog), Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group CO., LTD (CTTPG), Cogent Biosciences, Inc. (formerly known as Unum Therapeutics Inc.) (Cogent), Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi), Exelixis, Inc. (Exelixis), Immunicum AB (Immunicum), Jiangsu HengRui, Inc. (Jiangsu), Ningbo Tai Kang Medical Technology Co. Ltd. (NTKMT), Novartis, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (Taiho), and Xencor, Inc. (Xencor).
Competition for Vimseltinib
We are initially developing vimseltinib, a potent, and highly selective switch-control kinase inhibitor of CSF1R, for the treatment of patients with TGCT. If vimseltinib receives marketing approval, we may face competition from other companies marketing or developing antibodies and small molecules targeting CSF1R, including Abbisko Therapeutics Co., Ltd. (Abbisko), Daiichi, LifeMax Laboratories, Inc. (LifeMax), and SynOx Therapeutics Ltd (SynOx).
Competition for Rebastinib
We are initially developing rebastinib, a potential first-in-class TIE2 inhibitor, for the treatment of multiple solid tumors in combination with chemotherapy. While rebastinib is a novel molecule, we may face competition from drug candidates in clinical trials that are not TIE2 inhibitors, including small molecule drug candidates in clinical trials from Clovis Oncology, Inc. (Clovis), Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai), and Novartis, and from antibody therapeutics from AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca), ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen), Roche Holding Ltd. (Roche), Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), and Tesaro, a GlaxoSmithKline PLC company (Tesaro).
Competition for DCC-3116
We are initially developing DCC-3116, a potential first-in-class ULK kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of cancers caused by RAS or RAF mutations. While DCC-3116 is a novel molecule in early-stage development, we may face competition from drugs or drug candidates in clinical trials that are not ULK inhibitors, but also aim to address cancers caused by RAS or RAF mutations.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our drug candidates, for example, QINLOCK, vimseltinib, rebastinib, and DCC-3116, their methods of use, related technologies, and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform.
Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our approved drug and drug candidates and other commercially important technologies, inventions, and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others.
The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific, and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that our drug or any of our drug candidates will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property please see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
With regard to QINLOCK (ripretinib), as of January 31, 2021, we own three issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims. The first issued U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2030, and two issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2032. In addition, we own related patents and pending patent applications in Europe, Australia, South America, and Asia that will also expire in 2032. We also own six pending U.S. applications, and related pending applications in Europe, Australia, South America, and Asia, as well as three pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent applications directed to methods of using and drug product of QINLOCK (ripretinib) which, if granted, will expire between 2037 and 2040.
With regard to vimseltinib, as of January 31, 2021, we own one issued U.S. patent with composition of matter and method of use claims. The issued U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2034. In addition, we own related patents and pending applications in Europe, Australia, South America, and Asia that are expected to expire in 2034. We also own one pending U.S. application and one pending PCT patent application, which, if one or more patents claiming priority to these patent applications is granted, will expire in 2039.
With regard to rebastinib, as of January 31, 2021, we own three issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2027 and 2034. In addition, we own related issued patents in Australia, Canada, Asia, and Europe which are expected to expire in 2027 and pending patent applications in certain jurisdictions that if issued will expire between 2027 and 2034. We also own one pending U.S. application and one pending PCT patent application, which, if one or more patents claiming priority to these patent applications is granted, will expire in 2040. We also own one pending U.S. provisional application, which, if one or more patents claiming priority to this provisional application is granted, will expire in 2041.
With regard to DCC-3116, as of January 31, 2021, we own three pending U.S. applications and three pending PCT patent applications, which, if one or more patents claiming priority to these applications is granted, will expire in 2040.
With regard to our early stage programs, as of January 31, 2021, we have 10 pending U.S. provisional applications, which, if one or more patents claiming priority to these provisional applications is granted, will expire in 2041.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
In the U.S., the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, as compensation for the loss of patent term during FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering QINLOCK, vimseltinib, and rebastinib may be entitled to patent term extensions. We have applied for patent term extensions that, if granted, may extend the patent term of one of our granted U.S. patents and the patent terms of our two issued Australian patents for QINLOCK. We have obtained a Certificate of Supplementary Protection for our issued patent in Canada, extending the patent expiry date until 2034. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including, for example, our proprietary switch-control kinase inhibitor platform and certain aspects of our manufacturing processes. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, and potential collaborators, such individuals may breach such agreements and disclose our proprietary information including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain 
adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property please see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state, and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research and clinical development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, pricing, and export and import of drug products, such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety, and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review, and approved by the regulatory authority.
Drugs are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the regulatory authority's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, debarment, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
U.S. Drug Development
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical, sometimes referred to as nonclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies all performed in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA's good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices (GCPs) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a NDA for a new drug;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a NDA to file the NDA for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and finished drug product are produced to assess compliance with the FDA's current good manufacturing practice requirements (cGMP);
•potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
The data required to support a NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: preclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the preclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation, and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology, and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on patient safety and the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the 
proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit a trial, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time or to a certain number of subjects. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor's control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection, and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined, known as Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials. Phase 1 trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effects, tolerability, and safety of the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the drug and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a drug during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for approval of a NDA.
A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate's efficacy and safety such that it can serve as the primary basis for approval of the drug. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may be Phase 2 studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any finding from other clinical studies, tests in laboratory animals, or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, cGMPs impose extensive procedural, substantive, and recordkeeping requirements to 
ensure and preserve the long-term stability and quality of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
A manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy.
Moreover, the Right to Try Act, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
NDA and the FDA Review Process
Following trial completion, trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA, along with proposed labeling for the drug and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure drug quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug, and other relevant information. The NDA is a request for approval to market the drug and must contain adequate evidence of safety and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive preclinical and clinical testing. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product for a particular indication or indications to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the U.S.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA's fee schedule, effective from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an original NDA, is $2,875,842. The PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs ($336,432). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of an original NDA, the FDA reviews the application to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, including for failure to pay required fees, and may request additional information. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA typically makes a decision on whether to accept a NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the NDA. Under the performance goals established under the PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to review 90% of standard NDAs for new molecular entities (NMEs) in ten months from the filing date and 90% of priority NME NDAs in six months from the filing date. The goals for reviewing standard and priority non-NME NDAs are ten months and six months, respectively, measured from the receipt date of the application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the drug is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drugs or drug candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. In the course of its review, the FDA may re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation of a NDA by the 
FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
Before approving a NDA, the FDA typically conducts a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new drug to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the drug unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the drug within required specifications. In addition, before approving a NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process, and manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, challenge the determination set forth in the letter by requesting a hearing, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the U.S. and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process for any of our drug candidates. If a drug receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases, dosages, or patient subgroups, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the drug. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse events be included in the drug labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved drugs. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug's safety and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved drugs that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of drugs. Drug approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a Fast Track Designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs intended to treat serious conditions that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten-month review periods are measured from the "filing" date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for NME, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track Designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, drugs studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the 
FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or other clinical endpoint and to submit promotional materials for preapproval and pre-use review. In addition, the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, a sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a "breakthrough therapy." A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
In addition, the FDA may review applications under RTOR, which, according to the FDA, aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible, while maintaining and improving review quality. Drugs considered for review under RTOR must be likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over available therapy, which may include drugs previously granted breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) for the same or other indications, and must have straight-forward study designs and endpoints that can be easily interpreted. RTOR allows the FDA to review much of the data in a NDA earlier, before the applicant formally submits the complete application. This analysis of the pre-submission package gives the FDA and applicants an early opportunity to address data quality and potential review issues and allows the FDA to provide early feedback regarding the most effective way to analyze data to properly address key regulatory questions.
Project Orbis is an initiative of the FDA's OCE and, according to the FDA, provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. For example, in December 2019, for QINLOCK, we submitted our NDA to FDA, and filed an NDS with Health Canada and an AUS MAA with the TGA in Australia under Project Orbis.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of the expedited review programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track Designation, priority review, accelerated approval, BTD, RTOR, and Project Orbis do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Pediatric Trials
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), as amended, a NDA or supplement to a NDA for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug subject to PREA must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints, and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company and the approved drug are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, establishment registration and drug listing, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug's approved labeling (known as off-label promotion), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the 
internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, the FDA takes the position that manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the drug or its labeling or changes of the site or process of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process.
Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state, and foreign regulations. In the U.S., the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drugs and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, a part of the FDCA. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) was enacted in 2013 with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the U.S. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. The law's requirements include the quarantine and prompt investigation of a suspect product to determine if it is illegitimate, and notifying trading partners and the FDA of any illegitimate product. Drug manufacturers and their collaborators are also required to place a unique product identifier on prescription drug packages. This identifier consists of the National Drug Code, serial number, lot number, and expiration date, in the form of a 2-dimensional data matrix barcode that can be read by humans and machines.
In the U.S., once a drug is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. FDA regulations require that drugs be manufactured in specific facilities per the NDA approval and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our approved drug and drug candidates in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural, and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories, or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute drugs manufactured, processed, or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a drug after approval may result in restrictions on a drug, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the drug from the market, and may require substantial resources to correct.
The FDA also may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans, and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved drug or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial, or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug's approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA's policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our drug candidates under development.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities following drug approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Drug Enforcement Administration for controlled substances, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. In the U.S., sales, marketing, and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (or collectively, the ACA). If drugs are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Drugs must meet applicable child-resistant 
packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. In addition, our leasing and operation of real property may subject us to liability pursuant to certain U.S. environmental laws and regulations, under which current or previous owners or operators of real property and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances may be held strictly, jointly, and severally liable for the cost of investigating or remediating contamination caused by hazardous substance releases, even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases.
The distribution of pharmaceutical drugs is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage, and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs.
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall or seizure of drugs, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of our approved drug or any future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes, or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our product; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug or any of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a NDA plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. We intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents that cover any drug candidate that receives FDA approval to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-
year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with a FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a trial.
Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the 27 member states that comprise the European Union (EU) (the Member States) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (the EEA Member States), the European Commission, after receiving the opinion of the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) grants Orphan Drug Designation to also promote the development of orphan products. The relevant European legislation provides that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition and either (i) the prevalence of the condition is not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EEA when the application is made, or (ii) without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development. For either of these conditions, the applicant must also demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EEA or, if such method exists, the product has to be of significant benefit compared to products available for the condition.
In the U.S., Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
In the EEA, Orphan Drug Designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or any of the competent authorities in the EEA Member States can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a "similar medicinal product." A "similar medicinal product" is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period may be reduced to six years if, after five years, it is established that the Orphan Drug Designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity may also be revoked in very select cases, such as if (i) it is established that a similar medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the marketing authorization holder consents to such revocation; or (ii) the marketing authorization holder cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Beginning on January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan drug designation will apply in Great Britain. There will be no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation (as there is in the EEA) and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) the U.K. medicines regulator, at the time of a MAA. The criteria are the same as in the EEA, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g. there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain).
Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
Some of our drug candidates may require use of a diagnostic test to identify appropriate patient populations for our products. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are medical devices, often in vitro devices, which provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. In the U.S., the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, establishment registration and device listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market 
surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval application (PMA) approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for our drug or drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway.
PMAs must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA's evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval, or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for "In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices." According to the guidance, for novel drugs such as our drug or drug candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.
In the EEA, in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the EU Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the European Conformity (CE) mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. The in vitro diagnostic medical devices Directive is being replaced by a new Regulation in the EEA. The new Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/746) entered into force on 25 May 2017, and is subject to a 5 year transition period during which manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices must update their technical information and processes in line with the new Regulation. During the transition period, manufacturers may elect whether to put any new in vitro diagnostic devices under the Directive's regime or under the regulation of the new Regulation. Under European law, a Regulation differs from a Directive, as a regulation is directly effective in each Member State, without the need for implementing legislation (which is required for a Directive).
Following the U.K.'s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020, the U.K. (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) continued to follow the same regulations as the EU during a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020. Now that this transition period has ended, all in vitro medical devices must be registered with the MHRA before being placed on the Great Britain (GB) market. There is a grace period to allow time for compliance with the new registration process, with high risk device (i.e. List A products) requiring registration by May 1, 2021, and low risk devices requiring registration later in 2021 (List B products from September 1, 2021 and general in-vitro diagnostics from January 1, 2022). European CE marks will continue to be recognized in GB until June 30, 2023, following which a U.K.CA mark will be required for an in vitro medical device to be marketing in GB. The new EU Regulation will not automatically apply in GB, so the regulation of medical devices in GB may diverge from EU regulations in future. The EU regulatory framework on medical devices will, however, continue to apply in Northern Ireland under the Northern Irish Protocol and medical devices in Northern Ireland may either carry a European CE mark or a U.K. and Northern Ireland CE (CE U.K.NI) mark (although devices bearing the CE U.K.NI marking will not be accepted on the EU market).
European Drug Development
In Europe, our current or future approved drugs may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in Europe are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (the Directive) sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU Member States where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA) and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the member state where they occurred.
In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 (the Regulation), replacing the current Directive, was adopted. The new Regulation will become directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) following confirmation of the full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System, the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the new Regulation, through an independent audit. This is currently expected to occur in December 2021. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For example, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EU Portal. As part of the application process, the sponsor shall propose a reporting Member State, who will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting Member State shall consult and coordinate with the other Member States in which the clinical trial is to take place (such Member States being referred to as the Member States Concerned). If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all Member States Concerned. However, a Member State Concerned can in limited circumstances declare an "opt-out" from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that Member State. The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database.
The U.K. has implemented Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use Regulations, so U.K. regulation of clinical trials is currently aligned with EU regulations. Whether the U.K. will amend its legislation to align more closely with the new EU Regulation once that comes into effect is as yet unknown.
European Drug Review and Approval
In the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining an EU Marketing Authorization. There are two types of marketing authorizations.
The first is the centralized marketing authorization, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure (CP), based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA. A centralized marketing authorization is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The CP is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal drugs, advanced-therapy medicines (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy, or tissue-engineered medicines), orphan medicinal drugs, and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV or AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The CP is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
National EU marketing authorizations, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the CP. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in an EEA Member State, this national authorization can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a national authorization in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the authorization is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics (SPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national marketing authorization in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).
Under the above described procedures, before granting the marketing authorizations, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety, and efficacy.
Now that the U.K. has left the EU, GB will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized EU authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized authorization were automatically converted to GB marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new GB marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to marketing authorizations approved in EEA Member States through Decentralized or Mutual Recognition Procedures with a view to more quickly granting a marketing authorization in the U.K. or GB.
European Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In the EEA, innovative medicinal products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator's pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EEA. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the U.K.
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the U.K. voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The U.K. formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the U.K. and ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. covering quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K., as the U.K. legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for medicinal products and devices in the U.K. in the long-term. The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow now that the transition period is over, which will be updated as the U.K.'s regulatory position on medicinal products and medical devices evolves over time. Brexit has also created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the U.K., and in particular, how data transfers from the EU to the U.K. will be regulated. The EU and the U.K. have agreed a bridging period of up to six months to allow the continued free flow of data from the EU to the U.K., during which time the European Commission will assess whether the U.K. will be granted adequacy status. There is no certainty that an adequacy decision will be granted. If it is not, legal uncertainties regarding the flow of data across borders could increase the complexity and cost of transferring personal data from the EU to the U.K.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of Europe and the U.S., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, which is a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data, developed by the World Medical Association.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of QINLOCK and any future approved drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which such drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurers, and managed healthcare organizations, as well as the level of reimbursement such third-party payors provide for our products. Patients and providers are unlikely to use QINLOCK or any future approved drugs unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such drugs. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services.
In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs or biological products exists, and one payor's determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. In the U.S., the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the CMS, an agency within the HHS, as the CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private third-party payors tend to follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for QINLOCK or any of our drug candidates, if approved, are made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process may be a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of QINLOCK or any future approved drugs to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or will be losing employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.
Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for QINLOCK or any of our drug candidates, if approved, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover QINLOCK or any of our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of such drugs and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the MDRP, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers' rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate percentage on most branded prescription drugs of average manufacturer price (AMP) and adding a new rebate calculation for "line extensions" (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new methodology by which rebates owed are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the MMA) established the Medicare Part D (Part D) program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. These Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for QINLOCK or any drug candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for QINLOCK or any future drugs covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B (Part B) programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children's hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the Public Health Service's 340B Drug Pricing Program (the 340B program) to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of QINLOCK or any of our drug candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor's drug could adversely affect the sales of QINLOCK or any of our drug candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. If third-party payors do not consider QINLOCK or any future drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover such drugs as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell such drugs on a profitable basis.
In recent years, additional laws have resulted in direct or indirect reimbursement reductions for certain Medicare providers, including:
•The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
•The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for QINLOCK or any drug candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which QINLOCK or any such drug candidate is prescribed or used.
As noted above, the marketability of QINLOCK or any drug candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the U.S. will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal drugs for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal drug on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for QINLOCK or any of our future drugs. Historically, drugs launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
The ACA has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the MDRP are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the MDRP, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
The ACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each such manufacturer is required to pay a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. The ACA also expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities. Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer's drugs under Medicaid. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B "ceiling price" for the manufacturer's covered outpatient drugs. In addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid programs and purchased by certain federal grantees and agencies, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make products available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies—the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Public Health Service, and the Coast Guard—that is at least 24% less than the Non-Federal Average Manufacturing Price (non-FAMP) for the prior fiscal year. 
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to reform through legislation and Executive Orders of the previous President of the U.S. (the previous U.S. President), and to judicial challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld certain key aspects of the legislation, including a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly the requirement that all individuals maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty, referred to as the "individual mandate." However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Reform Act) included a provision repealing the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. Pending review, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect the latest ruling will have on the status of the ACA. The current U.S. presidential administration has indicated that enhancing the ACA is a legislative priority. We continue to evaluate legislative efforts regarding the ACA and its possible impact on our business.
The previous U.S. presidential administration signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. On January 20, 2017, the previous U.S. President signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, the previous U.S. President signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. The previous U.S. presidential administration concluded that cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments to insurance companies required under the ACA had not received necessary appropriations from Congress and discontinued these payments due to the lack of appropriations. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in Moda Health Plan, Inc. v. United States which held that the ACA requires the federal government to compensate insurers for significant losses their health plans incurred during the first three years of the ACA's marketplaces, and that insurers can sue for nonpayment in the Court of Federal Claims. The effects of this decision on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. 
On January 22, 2018, the previous U.S. President signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called "Cadillac" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. However, on December 20, 2019, the previous U.S. President signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repeals the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the BBA) among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the "donut hole."
In December 2018, the CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In addition, CMS has recently published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted that, directly or indirectly, affect or are likely to affect, the pharmaceutical industry and the commercialization of our products, including the BCA, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), and the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. In August 2011, the BCA, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, the Medicare sequester reductions under the BCA were suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ATRA among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our products that obtain marketing approval. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost-containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs. At the federal level, the previous U.S. presidential administration released a "Blueprint" to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. In May 2019, the CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified the CMS's policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. The U.S. Congress and the prior U.S. presidential administration have each indicated that they would continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on September 25, 2019, the Senate Finance Committee introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Action of 2019, a bill intended to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug prices. The proposed legislation would restructure the Part D benefit, modify payment methodologies for certain drugs, and impose an inflation cap on drug price increases. An even more restrictive bill, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 19, 2019, and would require HHS to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. The Lower Drugs Costs Now Act of 2019 has passed out of the House and was delivered to the Senate on December 16, 2019. However, it is unclear whether either of these bills will make it through both chambers and be signed into law, and if either is enacted, what effect it would have on our business. 
In the U.S., the MMA contains provisions that call for the promulgation of regulations that expand pharmacists' and wholesalers' ability to import cheaper versions of an approved drug and competing products from Canada, where there are government price controls. Further, the MMA provides that these changes to U.S. importation laws will not take effect, unless and 
until the Secretary of the HHS certifies that the changes will pose no additional risk to the public's health and safety and will result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers. On September 23, 2020, the Secretary of the HHS made such certification to Congress, and on October 1, 2020, the FDA published a final rule that allows for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. Under the final rule, States and Indian Tribes, and in certain future circumstances pharmacists and wholesalers, may submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization. On September 25, 2020, the CMS stated drugs imported by States under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for "best price" or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, the CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. Separately, the FDA also issued a final guidance document outlining a pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code for an FDA-approved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country. The market implications of the final rule and guidance are unknown at this time. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability.
Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Other Healthcare Laws
For our drug and any drug candidates that obtain regulatory approval and are marketed in the U.S., our arrangements with third-party payors, customers, and other third parties may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell, and distribute QINLOCK or any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to health information privacy and security regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the U.S., these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party on its behalf) to, knowingly and willfully offer, solicit, receive, or pay remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of this law are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, administrative civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act (FCA). The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil penalties, and authorizes civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program; making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have "caused" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback 
Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for QINLOCK or any future products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information, and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for QINLOCK or any future products, and the sale and marketing of QINLOCK and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
•The anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program.
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly or willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates, that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damage or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
•The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
•Federal price reporting laws require drug manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products.
•The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act), enacted as part of the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the HHS under the Open Payments Program, information related to payments and other "transfers of value" provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. In addition, many states also require the reporting of payments or other transfers of value. Many of these state laws differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback, false claims laws, consumer protection, and unfair competition laws, which may apply to pharmaceutical business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales, and marketing arrangements as well as submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Such laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, require drug manufacturers to report information related to pricing and marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations, and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians and other 
healthcare providers and entities, require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances. Such data privacy and security laws may differ from one another in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was enacted in June 2018, became effective on January 1, 2020, and became subject to enforcement by the California Attorney General's office on July 1, 2020. The CCPA broadly defines personal information, and creates new individual privacy rights and protections for California consumers (as defined in the law), places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. While there is an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, the CCPA may impact our business activities if we become a "Business" regulated by the scope of the CCPA.
In addition to the CCPA, new privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the states in the U.S. and in the U.S. Congress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which trend may accelerate depending on the new U.S. presidential administration. The effects of the CCPA, and other similar state or federal laws, are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation.
In the U.S., to help patients afford QINLOCK and any other products, if approved, we have various programs to assist them, including patient assistance programs and co-pay coupon programs for eligible patients. Government enforcement agencies have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies' product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, at least one insurer has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept co-pay coupons for certain specialty drugs the insurer identified. Our co-pay coupon programs could become the target of similar insurer actions. In November 2013, the CMS issued guidance to the issuers of qualified health plans sold through the ACA marketplaces encouraging such plans to reject patient cost-sharing support from third parties and indicating that the CMS intends to monitor the provision of such support and may take regulatory action to limit it in the future. The CMS subsequently issued a rule requiring individual market qualified health plans to accept third-party premium and cost-sharing payments from certain government-related entities. In September 2014, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the HHS issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute and/or civil monetary penalty laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. Accordingly, companies exclude these Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons.
Third party patient assistance programs that receive financial support from companies have become the subject of enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny. The OIG has established guidelines that suggest that it is lawful for pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor's product. However, donations to patient assistance programs have received some negative publicity and have been the subject of multiple government enforcement actions, related to allegations regarding their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. Specifically, in recent years, there have been multiple settlements resulting out of government claims challenging the legality of their patient assistance programs under a variety of federal and state laws.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and settlements in the healthcare industry. In November 2020, the OIG issued a Fraud Alert highlighting its view that pharmaceutical promotional speaker programs can pose a high risk of fraud and abuse. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional oversight, and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business 
is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company's attention from the business.
European Data Collection
In the EU, we may also face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks in connection with requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), and other data protection regulations. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EU as well as to those outside the EU if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR has enhanced data protection obligations for controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements, restrictions on transfers outside of the EU to third countries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections (such as the U.S.), and has created onerous new obligations and liabilities on services providers or data processors. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Notably, on January 21, 2019, Google was fined almost $57 million by French regulators for violating GDPR. Moreover, data subjects can claim damages resulting from infringement of the GPDR. The GDPR further grants non-profit organizations the right to bring claims on behalf of data subjects. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions that we may operate in. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. In addition, further to the U.K.'s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the U.K. at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. As of January 1, 2021, the GDPR has been brought into U.K. law as the 'U.K. GDPR', but there may be further developments about the regulation of particular issues such as U.K.-EU data transfers. We may be required to take steps to ensure the lawfulness of our data transfers, particularly if by the end of the transition period there will not be an adequacy decision by the European Commission regarding the U.K.
Human Capital Resources
Our employees are a key factor in our ability to achieve our mission of discovering, developing, and delivering important new medicines to patients for the treatment of cancer. As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 350 employees located in approximately 30 states across the United States. More than 200 employees are located at our headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts and approximately 50 employees are located at our research facility in Lawrence, Kansas.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We emphasize a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee engagement, development, and training, talent acquisition and retention, employee safety and wellness, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. In addition, we regularly conduct employee surveys to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.
We believe that developing a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture is critical to continuing to attract and retain the top talent necessary to deliver on our growth strategy and key to our long-term success. As such, we are investing in the creation of a work environment where our employees can feel inspired to deliver their workplace best every day. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds.
