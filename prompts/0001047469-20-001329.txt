  OVERVIEW 
   Our Company 
         We are a leading U.S. Spanish-language media company serving the fast growing and highly attractive U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets with broadcast and cable television networks and digital content platforms including five Spanish-language cable television networks distributed in the U.S., two Spanish-language cable television networks distributed in Latin America, the #1-rated broadcast television network in Puerto Rico, the #3-rated broadcast television network in Colombia, a Spanish-language over-the-top ("OTT") video subscription service distributed in the U.S. and a leading distributor of content to television and digital media platforms in Latin America. 
         Headquartered in Miami, Florida, our portfolio consists of the following: 

   
Cinelatino: the leading Spanish-language cable movie network with over 20 million subscribers across the U.S., Latin America and Canada. Cinelatino is programmed with a lineup featuring the best contemporary films and original television series from Mexico, Latin America, and the U.S. Driven by the strength of its programming and distribution, Cinelatino is the #2-Nielsen rated Spanish-language cable television network in the U.S. overall, based on coverage ratings. 
WAPA: the leading broadcast television network and television content producer in Puerto Rico. WAPA has been the #1-rated broadcast television network in Puerto Rico since the start of Nielsen audience measurement ten years ago.

Additionally, we operate WAPA.TV, a leading news and entertainment website in Puerto Rico, featuring content produced by WAPA. 
WAPA Deportes: Through its multicast signal, WAPA distributes WAPA Deportes, a leading sports television network in Puerto Rico, featuring Major League Baseball ("MLB"), National Basketball Association ("NBA") and professional sporting events from Puerto Rico.

Pasiones: a cable television network dedicated to showcasing the most popular telenovelas and serialized dramas, distributed in the U.S. and Latin America. Pasiones features top-rated telenovelas from Latin America, Turkey, India, and South Korea (dubbed into Spanish), and is currently the highest rated cable television network devoted to telenovelas. Pasiones has over 21 million subscribers across the U.S. and Latin America. 
Centroamerica TV: a cable television network targeting Central Americans living in the U.S., the third largest U.S. Hispanic group and the fastest growing segment of the U.S. Hispanic population. Centroamerica TV features the most popular news and entertainment from Central America, as well as soccer programming from the top professional soccer leagues in the region. Centroamerica TV is distributed in the U.S. to approximately 4 million subscribers.

Television Dominicana airs the most popular news and entertainment programs from the Dominican Republic, as well as the Dominican Republic professional baseball league, featuring current and former players from MLB. Television Dominicana is distributed in the U.S. to approximately 2.4 million subscribers. 
Canal 1: the #3-rated broadcast television network in Colombia. We own a 40% interest in Canal 1 in partnership with leading producers of news and entertainment content in Colombia. The partnership was awarded a 10-year renewable broadcast television concession in 2016. The partnership began operating Canal 1 on May 1, 2017 and launched a new programming lineup on August 14, 2017. In July 2019, the Colombian government enacted legislation resulting in the extension of the concession license for an additional ten years for no additional consideration. The concession is now due to expire on April 30, 2037 and is renewable for an additional 20-year period.
Pantaya: the first-ever premium streaming destination for world-class movies and series in Spanish offering the largest selection of current and classic, commercial-free blockbusters and critically acclaimed titles from Latin America and the U.S. including content from our library, Pantelion's U.S. theatrical titles, Lionsgate's movie library, and Grupo Televisa's theatrical releases in Mexico, as well as, original productions, comedy specials and concerts. We own a 25% interest in Pantaya in partnership with Lionsgate, which service launched in August 2017.

Snap Media: a distributor of content to broadcast and cable television networks and OTT, SVOD and AVOD platforms in Latin America. On November 26, 2018, we acquired a 75% interest in Snap Media, and in connection with the acquisition, Snap Media entered into a joint venture with Mar Vista Entertainment, LLC ("MarVista"), an independent entertainment studio and a shareholder of Snap Media, to produce original movies and series. Snap Media is responsible for the distribution of content owned and/or controlled by our Networks, as well as content to be produced by the production joint venture between Snap Media and MarVista.
REMEZCLA: a digital media company targeting English speaking and bilingual U.S. Hispanic millennials through innovative content. On April 28, 2017, we acquired a 25.5% interest in REMEZCLA. 


        Hemisphere was incorporated in Delaware on January 16, 2013. Shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Class A common stock") are publicly traded under the symbol "HMTV" on the Nasdaq Global Market ("NASDAQ"). 
   Our Strategy 
         Our strategy in the U.S. is to provide unique programming focused on underserved but significant segments of the U.S. Hispanic population, allowing us to reach a deeper and broader U.S. Hispanic demographic than our competitors. Our networks allow many viewers in the U.S. to feel connected with their home countries, including high quality, differentiated local news, sports and entertainment content. For instance, WAPA America is the only nightly newscast from Puerto Rico created for U.S. Hispanics, which is a part of the network's over 65 hours of weekly original news and entertainment programming. Additionally, as the only U.S. cable network to offer unique and popular telenovelas from around the globe, Pasiones significantly out-rated the Univision Tlnovelas network in primetime in 2019, according to ComScore. By focusing on these specific Hispanic markets, we provide targeted, attractive and relevant content, while avoiding direct competition with channels such as Univision and Telemundo, which more acutely target the U.S. Mexican demographic. 
         WAPA has been the #1-rated broadcast television network in Puerto Rico since the start of Nielsen audience measurement ten years ago and management believes it is highly valued by its viewers and cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers. WAPA is distributed by all pay-TV distributors in Puerto Rico and has been successfully growing affiliate fees. WAPA's primetime household rating in 2019 was five times higher than the most highly rated English-language U.S. broadcast network in the U.S., CBS, and higher than the combined ratings of CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX and the CW. As a result of its ratings success since the start of Nielsen audience measurement, management believes WAPA is well positioned for future growth in affiliate fees. 
         WAPA America, Cinelatino, Pasiones, Centroamerica TV and Television Dominicana occupy a valuable and unique position, as they are among the small group of Hispanic cable networks to have achieved broad distribution in the U.S. As a result, management believes our U.S. cable networks are well-positioned to benefit from growth in both the growing national advertising spend targeted at the highly sought-after U.S. Hispanic cable television audience, and growth in subscribers, as the U.S. Hispanic population continues its long-term upward trajectory. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 
 7

   nearly 60 million Hispanics resided in the United States in 2018, representing an increase of more than 24 million people between 2000 and 2018, and that number is projected to grow to 75 million by 2030. U.S. Hispanic television households grew by 31% during the period from 2010 to 2020, from 12.9 million households to 16.9 million households. Hispanic pay-TV subscribers increased 2.3% since 2010 to 11.1 million subscribers in 2020. Although our U.S. cable networks total subscribers declined during 2019, given the expected growth of Hispanic television households and pay-TV subscribers, we are optimistic that our U.S. cable networks total subscribers will see renewed long-term growth, which creates a significant opportunity for all of our U.S. cable networks. 
         Our strategy in Latin America is to make similar strides as our networks in the U.S. Additionally, Canal 1 continues to drive growth in Colombia, the third largest Latin American television advertising market according to Portada. Colombia represents a robust and stable economy and Canal 1 represents one of only three national broadcast television networks. We believe that Canal 1 can create a compelling, differentiated programming option in Colombia, similar to our experience with WAPA in Puerto Rico. At the same time, we are working to identify leading or underperforming media assets in attractive Latin American markets that can benefit from management's television expertise. We believe that our business model is highly scalable and that we could drive profitable growth by replicating this model across Latin America. 
         We believe that our platform value is significant, allowing us to leverage content and distribution relationships across different geographies. We are able to use content that we own or have licensed across our media properties, giving us economies of scale. 
         Our objective is to maintain and improve our position as a leading U.S. Spanish-language media company serving the U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets by, among other things: 
         Growing affiliate feesWe believe our Networks are well-positioned to further grow our affiliate fees, fueled by strong ratings, continued growth in our target demographic audiences and robust content portfolio. For example, WAPA recently renewed its expiring retransmission agreements on very favorable terms by virtue of its dominance in the Puerto Rico market, and these agreements will generate significant affiliate fee growth for us. With no reverse compensation, our affiliate fees have high margin flow through to income. We expect to continue to expand the distribution of our Networks in the U.S., and our two Latin American cable networks on additional systems in under-penetrated markets. For example, on April 1, 2019, Pasiones was launched by Charter Communications, Inc. across Spectrum's systems nationally in the U.S. and, as a result, Pasiones is now available on all major Distributors nationwide. As U.S. cable television distributors become more focused on targeting the Hispanic audience, as a way to grow subscribers, we believe that our Networks will be well-positioned to capture the upside. In Latin America, Cinelatino and Pasiones are currently distributed to only approximately 29% and 30% of pay-TV subscribers (excluding Brazil) respectively, creating an opportunity to expand distribution through new launches. 
  Driving growth in advertising salesWe continue to see a large opportunity to increase our advertising revenues. Our U.S. cable networks are well positioned to benefit from the advertising spend targeted at the highly sought-after U.S. Hispanic audience. We offer a unique and differentiated target audience for our advertisers, driven by our targeted demographic and our ability to segment the U.S. Hispanic population. The Latin American feed of Cinelatino remains commercial-free, presenting an opportunity to be converted to an ad-supported model in select robust advertising markets. 
  Investing in content for our Networks to build viewershipWe have made substantial investment in our programming and marketing efforts in order to expand our distribution reach, increase our audience size, and increase our attractiveness to advertisers. We will continue to invest in programming in 2020. To date, we have successfully created a highly differentiated content strategy at WAPA and in doing so, have maintained a #1 ratings ranking in the Puerto Rico market for ten consecutive years.

   Cinelatino, as the only buyer of scale that can cover both the U.S. and Latin American markets for television rights to Spanish-language films, is well-positioned to acquire the best content available at favorable terms and has built an expansive content library. Pasiones, which features a unique slate of telenovelas from Latin America, as well as Turkey, India and South Korea (dubbed into Spanish), delivered the highest ratings in the history of the channel in the year ended December 31, 2019, marking the third consecutive year of record ratings, and beat Univision's Tlnovelas channel in primetime and total day. 
  Develop and expand content licensing revenuePresently, our two primary revenue streams are affiliate fees and advertising revenue, but we believe an opportunity exists to grow our revenues from content licensing. We own and control all media rights for a vast majority of our content and we continue to produce original content for our channels. In November 2018, we acquired Snap Media, which provides us with the expertise and relationships to expand our content licensing business. Our strategy is to window content across our platforms and to license the content to third parties for exploitation on free-TV, pay-TV, OTT, SVOD and AVOD platforms in the U.S. and Latin America. We believe this high-margin revenue from content licensing will help drive our revenue growth and profitability. 
  Acquisition-driven growthWe continue to look for attractive opportunities to acquire assets of varying scale that we consider to be undervalued or fairly valued with attractive financial or strategic characteristics. We intend to take a long-term view and primarily seek opportunities which will expand our leadership position in the fast growing and highly desirable Spanish-language media market in the U.S. and Latin America. We intend to seek a variety of acquisition opportunities, including businesses where we believe a catalyst for value realization is already present, or where we can realize synergies with our existing businesses. These may include Spanish-language cable networks distributed in the U.S., Latin American broadcast and cable television networks, production companies and content libraries. We may also seek businesses that are in need of operational turnaround through our experienced and knowledgeable management team, which has a proven ability to develop and grow acquired assets. We believe our business model is highly scalable and that we can leverage our playbook and existing content to help improve these types of businesses. For example, in 2016, in partnership with leading content producers in Colombia, we acquired a broadcast television concession in Colombia and began operating Canal 1. In a short time following commencement of operations, Canal 1 is the #3-rated broadcast television network in Colombia, having grown its audience share by 38% year-over-year for the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018, including a 66% growth in weekday primetime. Consistent with this strategy, we are currently evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities, some of which would be material. 
  Well-positioned to capture growth from over-the-top distributionWe believe that the digital media opportunity has the potential of providing long-term growth and value, and that we are well-positioned to capture that upside. We own digital rights for the vast majority of our content and are distribution agnostic when it comes to capturing viewers wherever and however they choose to consume video content. 
         Furthermore, we own an expansive library of the best Spanish-language films and other content and are continually generating new content that can be distributed digitally or licensed to OTT platforms. Spanish-language content remains an underserved category among OTT platforms in the U.S. Seeing an opportunity, in partnership with Lionsgate, we created Pantaya, a Spanish-language OTT video subscription service that allows audiences to access many of the best and most current Spanish-language films and series. We believe Pantaya is uniquely positioned to be the leading player in the Spanish-language OTT space as it benefits from the collective content libraries and marketing infrastructure of its partners and the Starz, LLC technology platform.

     Employees 
         At December 31, 2019, we and our subsidiaries employed 330 full-time persons. In the normal course of business, we use contract personnel to supplement our employee base to meet business needs. We or our subsidiaries may hire additional personnel in connection with the closing of future acquisitions. We believe that employee relations are generally satisfactory. Approximately 146 of our employees based in Puerto Rico are full-time unionized employees covered by two collective bargaining agreements (each, a "CBA" and collectively, the "CBAs"). Our main CBA expires on May 31, 2022 and covers all of our unionized employees except for three employees covered by the other CBA which expired on June 27, 2019 and we continue to operate under the terms of the CBA. Following the expiration of the term, the Company and the employees' union, Union de Periodistas Artes Graficas y Ramas Anexas (UPAGRA), continue to engage in active and good faith negotiations. 
 Revenue Sources 
         Our two primary sources of revenues are advertising revenues and affiliate fees. All of our Networks derive revenues from advertising. Advertising revenues are generated from the sale of advertising time, which is typically sold pursuant to advertising orders with advertisers providing for an agreed upon advertising commitment and price per spot. Our advertising revenues are tied to the success of our programming, including the popularity of our programming as measured by Nielsen. Our advertising is variable in nature and tends to reflect seasonal patterns of our advertisers' demand, which is generally greatest during the fourth quarter of each year, driven by the holiday buying season. In addition, Puerto Rico's political election cycle occurs every four years and we benefit from increased advertising sales in an election year. For example, in 2016, we experienced higher advertising sales as a result of political advertising spending during the 2016 gubernatorial elections. The next election in Puerto Rico will be in 2020. 
         All of our Networks receive fees paid by distributors, including cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers. These revenues are generally based on a per subscriber fee pursuant to multi-year contracts, commonly referred to as "affiliation agreements," which typically provide for annual rate increases. The specific affiliate fees we earn vary from period to period, distributor to distributor and also vary among our Networks, but are generally based upon the number of each distributor's paying subscribers who receive our Networks. The terms of certain non-U.S. affiliation agreements provide for payment of a fixed contractual monthly fee. Changes in affiliate fees are primarily derived from changes in contractual affiliation rates charged for our Networks and changes in the number of subscribers. Accordingly, we continually review the quality of our programming to ensure that it is maximizing our Networks' viewership and giving our Networks' subscribers a premium, high-value experience. The continued growth in our affiliate fees will, to a certain extent, be dependent on the growth in subscribers of the cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers distributing our Networks, new system launches and continued carriage of our channels by our distribution partners. Our revenues also benefit from contractual rate increases stipulated in most of our affiliation agreements. Our Networks depend upon agreements with a limited number of Distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2019, one of our Distributors accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues. We recognize affiliate fees when they are accrued pursuant to the agreements we have entered into with respect to such revenue. We set forth our net revenue, total assets and operating income in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
         Over time, affiliate fees have become an increasing portion of our total revenues. We believe that this development is a positive one for our business, given that affiliate fees are contracted and recurring and provide greater visibility into future performance. 
         In 2019, we generated approximately 92% of our net revenues from the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we generated $137.7 million and $136.2 million, respectively, 
 10

   from the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we generated $11.7 million and $10.9 million, respectively, from outside the United States.

   Cinelatino 
         Cinelatino is the leading Spanish-language cable movie network with more than 20 million subscribers across the U.S., Latin America and Canada. Cinelatino is programmed with a lineup featuring what we believe to be the best contemporary films and original television series from Mexico, Latin America and the U.S. Cinelatino was launched in Mexico in 1993, and introduced into the U.S. in 1995. 
         Our programming strategy for Cinelatino is specifically intended to provide the audience with the broadest selection of the most popular and highest-quality films across all popular genres, from Mexico and all other Latin American countries that have significant populations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and Peru.

The network sets itself apart by showcasing telenovelas produced in Latin America, Turkey, India, South Korea and other countries (dubbed into Spanish), in contrast to competitor networks such as Univision Tlnovelas, which focus almost exclusively on Mexican telenovelas. This diverse programming strategy made Pasiones the #1-rated telenovela network in both primetime and total day in 2019. In owning both Pasiones and Cinelatino, we provide content in two of the most popular genres with Hispanics, telenovelas and movies.

  Joint Ventures/Investments 
         On November 3, 2016, we formed a joint venture with Lionsgate, pursuant to which we own a 25% interest in Pantaya, a Spanish-language OTT subscription video on-demand service featuring movies and series. The service launched in the U.S. on August 1, 2017. The investment is deemed a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") that is accounted for under the equity method. 
         On November 30, 2016, we, in partnership with Colombian content producers, Radio Television Interamericana S.A., Compania de Medios de Informacion S.A.S. and NTC Nacional de Television y Comunicaciones S.A., were awarded a ten (10) year renewable television broadcast concession license for Canal 1 in Colombia.

   OUR COMPETITION 
         We compete for the development and acquisition of programming, distribution of our Networks, selling of commercial time on our Networks, viewership of our Networks, and on-air and creative talent. Our Networks compete with other Spanish-language broadcast and cable television networks and digital media companies for the acquisition of programming, viewership, the sale of advertising and creative talent. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content impacts our viewership and the sale of advertising. 
         We also compete with both Spanish-language and English-language broadcast and cable television networks for distribution of our Networks and the fees paid by cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers. Our ability to retain and secure distribution agreements is necessary to maintain and grow affiliate fees, and to attain viewership which drives advertising sales. Our contractual agreements with Distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The launch of new networks and consolidation within the cable and satellite distribution industry may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain distribution of our Networks. 
         Certain technological advances, including the increased deployment of fiber optic cable, are expected to allow cable and telecommunication video service providers to continue to expand both their channel and broadband distribution capacities and to increase transmission speeds. In addition, the ability to deliver content via new methods and devices is expected to increase substantially. The impact of such added capacities is hard to predict, but the development of new channels of content distribution could lead to increased competition for viewers by facilitating the emergence of additional channels and mobile and internet platforms through which viewers could view programming that is similar to that offered by our Networks. 
         WAPA competes with broadcast television networks and cable television networks in Puerto Rico for audience viewership, advertising sales, and programming. WAPA's main competitors are broadcast television stations owned by Univision and Telemundo, which rely heavily on their U.S. parents for 
 14

   programming, consisting primarily of telenovelas produced in Mexico, the U.S. and Latin America. There are a few other local broadcasters, but they tend not to be competitive due to weak programming and/or poor signal quality. In addition, while all major English-language U.S. broadcast networks have local affiliates, they are, for the most part, low power stations with nominal ratings. Cable channels are generally not competitive, as they tend to be U.S.-based, English-language channels with little relevance to the Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican audience, and pay television is much less widely penetrated in Puerto Rico than the U.S. WAPA has effectively customized its programming for the viewing preferences of the Puerto Rican market with more local entertainment and news programming than its competitors, as well as blockbuster Hollywood movies and hit U.S. television series (dubbed into Spanish). As a result, since the start of Nielsen audience measurement, WAPA has been the ratings leader for the past ten years. WAPA Deportes competes for viewership, advertising sales and programming with other channels offering similar sports programming in Puerto Rico. Competitors include U.S.-based cable networks, such as ESPN, TNT, and TBS, and certain satellite distributors who have acquired sports media rights for their owned channels. WAPA.TV, WAPA's mobile-optimized website, directly competes with other local news, weather and entertainment sites for traffic and advertising sales. To some extent, WAPA.TV also competes with search engines and social networks, such as Google and Facebook, for digital advertising revenue. 
         Many of our competitors may possess greater resources than us, and our financial resources may be relatively limited when contrasted with many of these competitors. 
   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
         Our intellectual property assets principally include copyrights in television programming, websites and other content, trademarks in brands, names and logos, domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The protection of our Networks' brands and content is of primary importance to our success. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and internet/domain name statutes, laws and contractual provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work. 
         Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. 
   INDUSTRY 
   U.S. Hispanic Market 
         The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that nearly 60 million Hispanics resided in the United States in 2018, representing an increase of more than 24 million people between 2000 and 2018. Hispanics represent the largest minority group in the U.S. at over 18% of the total U.S. population and accounted for over half of the total U.S. population growth between 2000 and 2018. This trend is expected to continue as the U.S. Hispanic population is projected to grow to 75 million by 2030, an increase of 25% from 2018. As a result of this growth, the U.S. Hispanic market represents the largest Hispanic economy in the world. In addition, the Hispanic population on average is significantly younger 
 15

   than the overall population. For example, the median age of U.S. Hispanics is 29.5, which is 11 years younger than the median age for non-Hispanic whites. 
         Claritas estimates that as of January 1, 2020, about 66% of the U.S. Hispanic population was of Mexican origin, followed by Puerto Rican, the second largest Hispanic national group, at approximately 10%. There are 6.0 million Puerto Ricans and an additional 5.8 million Hispanics from other Caribbean countries residing in the mainland U.S., and together, Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean Hispanics represent approximately 19% of the total U.S. Hispanic population. The Puerto Rican population in the U.S. grew 77% from 2000 to 2020, while the overall Caribbean Hispanic population grew 98% during the same time period, including the Dominican population which grew 229% from 2000 to 2020.

  Hispanic Television and Pay-TV Landscape 
         Within the U.S. cable network industry, the U.S. Hispanic demographic is attractive for a number of reasons:
 

 Growth in Hispanic TV households: U.S. Hispanic television households grew by 31% during the period from 2010 to 2020, from 12.9 million
households to 16.9 million households, over six times the overall U.S. television household growth of only 5%. The continued long-term growth 

 16

   

of
Hispanic television households creates a significant opportunity to reach an attractive audience at a time when overall household growth in the U.S. is more modest. 


 Growth in Hispanic pay-TV subscribers: Hispanic pay-TV subscribers are expected to continue to grow, driven not only by the rapid growth in
Hispanic television households, but also by the increased penetration of pay-TV among Hispanics. Hispanic pay-TV subscribers increased 2.3% from 2010 to 2020, growing from 10.8 million to
11.1 million subscribers. This 2.3% growth in Hispanic pay-TV subscribers is impressive compared to the 15% decline in overall U.S. pay-TV subscribers during the same period. 

 Television Viewing and Language Preferences 
 

 Hispanics Enjoy Movies: In 2018, while Hispanics made up 18% of the U.S. population, they comprised 24% of the country's frequent moviegoers
(i.e., those who attend movies at least once per month). In fact, the President of the National Association of Theater Owners described Hispanics as "the most valuable component of moviegoers."
In 2018, Hispanics saw 4.7 movies per year, higher than any other ethnicity group. 
 Hispanics Prefer Television in Spanish: Spanish remains the most used language in the home by U.S. Hispanic adults, and this powerfully
influences television viewing habits. According to Nielsen, 59% of Hispanics aged 18 and over speak Spanish as much as or more than English in their homes. Spanish-dominant or bilingual
(Spanish/English Equal) homes comprise about 64% of U.S. Hispanic households, and these homes exhibit a strong preference to watch television in their native language. In 2019, Spanish-dominant
adults in key marketing demographics viewed 77% of television in Spanish and bilingual adults viewed about 48% of television in Spanish. 

 Hispanic Advertising Market 
         Persons living in Hispanic television households represent 18% of the total U.S. television household population and 11% of the total U.S. buying power, but the aggregate media spend targeted at U.S. Hispanics significantly under-indexes both of these metrics. As a result, advertisers have been allocating a higher proportion of marketing dollars to the Hispanic market, but U.S. Hispanic cable advertising still under-indexes relative to its consumption. 
         Similar to the under-indexing of U.S. general market cable advertising relative to viewing share in the 1980's and 1990's, U.S. Hispanic cable advertising today significantly under-indexes relative to its share of the Spanish-language television audience. In 2018, the latest year in which U.S. Hispanic television advertising data is available, U.S. Hispanic cable networks garnered only 5% of total U.S. Hispanic national television advertising, while accounting for a 17% share of total Spanish-language television viewing in 2019. Viewing of Spanish-language cable networks as a percentage of total Spanish-language television viewing has grown dramatically from 11% in 2008 to 17% in 2019. 
   Latin American Market (excluding Brazil) 
         Latin America remains an attractive region due to its large population, shared language, strong economic growth and growing discretionary spending. Pay-TV subscribers in Latin America grew by 17% from 2014 to 2019, and are projected to grow an additional 6.6 million from 54.8 million in 2019 to 61.5 million by 2023 representing projected growth of 12%. Pay-TV penetration of television households has expanded from 46% in 2014 to 49% in 2019 and is projected to reach 51% by 2023. This growth is expected to be driven by a sizeable and growing population, as well as a strong macroeconomic backdrop and rising disposable income across geographies. In addition, investments in network infrastructure have improved service and performance, leading to increased penetration for pay-TV operators. 
 17

           Colombia, where we own 40% of Canal 1, the #3-rated broadcast television network, is a large and appealing market for broadcast television. Colombia had a population of 51 million as of December 31, 2019, the second largest in Latin America (excluding Brazil). According to IBOPE, the three major broadcast networks in Colombia receive a 53% share of overall viewing. These factors result in an annual market for free-to-air television advertising of approximately $287 million and the third largest Latin American television advertising market overall (excluding Brazil). 
   Puerto Rico Overview 
         The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and has a U.S. dollar-based economy, U.S. rule of law and strong governmental ties to the United States. The broadcast television industry in Puerto Rico is regulated by the FCC, and the banking system is regulated under the U.S. system (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). As of July 2019, Puerto Rico had a population of approximately 3.2 million, with an additional 6.0 million Puerto Ricans living in the mainland U.S. All Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. 
 Economy 
         The Puerto Rican economy has been in a recession since 2006, and its gross national product (GNP) has contracted in real terms every year between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2016 (except for growth of 0.5% in fiscal year 2012). Puerto Rico has been burdened by limited economic activity, lower-than-estimated revenue collections, high government debt levels relative to the size of the economy and other fiscal challenges. On June 30, 2016, President Obama signed HR 5278 Bill, the "Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which, among other things, established a seven-member Federally-appointed oversight board (the "Oversight Board") with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and provides to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad-based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy-type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Commonwealth's inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders, has resulted in the Commonwealth and various public corporations defaulting on their public debt and entering into bankruptcy proceedings under PROMESA. 
         During the month of September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, two major hurricanes, caused extensive destruction in Puerto Rico. Hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, 2017, and all of Puerto Rico was left without electrical power, and other basic infrastructure services (such as water, communications, ports and other transportation networks) were severely curtailed. Additionally, the hurricanes also accelerated the outmigration trends that Puerto Rico was experiencing, with increased numbers of residents moving to the mainland United States, either on a temporary or permanent basis. The hurricanes caused a significant disruption to the island's economic activity and GNP. 
         On January 7, 2020, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake impacted the southwestern part of Puerto Rico. Since then, Puerto Rico has continued to be affected by over 3,000 aftershocks. Further, a power plant located close to the epicenter, which generates a significant portion of Puerto Rico's power, was disabled and continues to be offline. Power was restored to most of the island within a week of the initial impact with the help of other power plants. 
         Puerto Rico continues in its efforts to rebuild its infrastructure and to otherwise recover from the impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017, aided in part by Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") and other federal agencies. On February 29, 2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico submitted a revised fiscal plan to the Financial Oversight and Management Board of Puerto Rico ("FOMB"). According to the submitted fiscal plan, Puerto Rico's GNP grew 2.4% in the Puerto Rico government's Fiscal Year 2019, which ended June 30, 2019, and is predicted to grow 0.4% for Fiscal Year 2020 and to decline 1.5% for Fiscal Year 2021. This more conservative estimate assumes a slower roll-out of 
 18

   federal funds to the island. The revised fiscal plan estimate has not yet been approved by the FOMB. Congress has approved almost $44 billion for recovery from Hurricane Maria between FEMA and Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"). About $8 billion of that money was used for emergency recovery during the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Of the remaining $36 billion, it is expected that $16 billion will be used for recovery through FEMA and the rest of the funds would come from HUD. Only a small percentage of this remaining aid has been disbursed into the projects they were intended to fund and remain on hold pending approvals of the use of funds. The extent and duration of such aid is inherently uncertain. 
         Notwithstanding challenges, employment statistics have been improving on the island. Total non-farm payroll employment increased by 1.27% in 2019 when compared to the yearly average for 2018. The average unemployment rate for fiscal year 2019 stood at 8.23% which is 93 basis points lower than the average for fiscal year 2018. This is the lowest annual unemployment rate the island has seen in the last 30 years. 
         Energy costs in Puerto Rico continue to remain high. The average energy cost in December of 2019 across all classes was 24.1 ¢/kWh, an increase of 1.1 ¢/kWh compared to December of 2018. The average cost of energy has risen by nearly 4 ¢/kWh since 2016, an increase of 19.6%. 
         Additional financial metrics are showing positive signs. New car sales totaled 106,000 in 2019, the second consecutive year with more than 100,000 in new car units sold. Moreover, following the post-Hurricane Maria recovery, Puerto Rico's population has stabilized at 3.2 million, a modest increase over 2018 and Nielsen television households increased slightly over the same period. 
         PROMESA continues to be an important step towards reducing the level of uncertainty in Puerto Rico and provides a groundwork for an orderly debt restructuring process, however, ultimate outcomes of actions to address the challenging Puerto Rico economic environment are uncertain at this time. On February 4, 2019, the District Court entered an order approving the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment for Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation ("COFINA"), including the settlement agreement between the Commonwealth and COFINA. The effective date of the Plan was February 12, 2019. On February 9, 2020, the Oversight Board proposed a Plan Support Agreement ("PSA") for Puerto Rico's General Obligation bond liability, reducing that $35 billion debt to less than $11 billion. The PSA requires judicial confirmation which is expected to occur later in 2020. There can be no assurance that any past or new actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will achieve their intended effect. 
   Puerto Rico Broadcast Television Market 
         Puerto Rico has 1.3 million television households, comparable to that of a top 25 U.S. television market. Puerto Rico is the third largest U.S. Hispanic market behind Los Angeles and New York. 
         Puerto Rican television broadcasters capture the dominant share of viewership, which is unique relative to the U.S. The three primary broadcasters in Puerto RicoWAPA, Univision and Telemundocollectively garner approximately 74% of all television household viewership in primetime, distinguishing Puerto Rico from the U.S. television market, where the four major national broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox) garner a collective primetime audience share of 20%. In fact, WAPA's primetime household rating in 2019 was five times higher than the most highly rated English-language U.S. broadcast network in the U.S., CBS, and higher than the combined ratings of CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX and the CW. 
   GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
         Our broadcast and cable network operations are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, Puerto Rico and other countries where they operate. The rules, regulations, 
 19

   policies and procedures affecting our Business are constantly subject to change. This section contains a summary of certain government regulations that may affect our operations. This information is summary in nature and does not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our Business. 
   Introduction 
         Our Networks are subject to regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended ("Communications Act"). Under authority of the Communications Act, the FCC, among other things, assigns frequency bands for broadcast stations, including the WAPA stations, and other uses; determines the location, frequency and operating power of stations; grants permits and licenses to construct and operate television stations on particular frequencies; issues, revokes, modifies and renews television broadcast station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses; and adopts and implements regulations and policies which directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operations and profitability of broadcasting stations. 
         The FCC has also adopted various rules that regulate the content of programming broadcast by television stations, including the WAPA station, and carried by cable networks, including our Cable Networks. These rules regulate, among other things, children's programming, sponsorship identification disclosures, closed captioning of certain television programming, and obscene, indecent and profane content. Additionally, the FCC's rules require broadcast stations to implement equal employment opportunity outreach programs and maintain records relating to these programs and make filings with the FCC evidencing such efforts. The FCC could also adopt other regulations that affect cable networks, such as the requirement that the cable programming services be on an "á la carte" basis, which could affect their business operations. 
         The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, and specific FCC rules and policies and certain other statutes and regulations. The summaries are not intended to describe all present and proposed statutes and FCC rules and regulations that impact broadcast television and cable network operations. Failure to observe the provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC's rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of "short-term" (less than the maximum term) broadcast license renewals or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a broadcast license renewal application, the revocation of a broadcast license, or the withholding of approval for acquisition of additional broadcast properties. 
   FCC Licenses and Renewal 
         The Communications Act permits the operation of a broadcast station only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants broadcast licenses for specified periods of time and, upon application, may renew the licenses for additional terms (ordinarily for the full term of eight years). Generally, the FCC renews a broadcast license upon a finding that (i) the broadcast station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC's rules; and (iii) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or other FCC rules which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. After considering these factors, the FCC may renew a broadcast station's license, either with conditions or without, or it may designate the renewal application for hearing. In 2013, the FCC renewed our television licenses for full eight year terms expiring in February 1, 2021. We must file renewal applications for our television stations by October 1, 2020. 
 20

     Media Ownership Restrictions and FCC Proceedings 
         The FCC's broadcast ownership rules affect the number, type and location of broadcast and newspaper properties that we are allowed to hold or acquire. The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules every four years to determine if such rules remain necessary in the public interest. The rules limit the common ownership, directly or by way of attribution, operation or control of television stations serving the same area. The rules also limit the aggregate national audience reach of television stations under common ownership, directly or by way of attribution. In 2017, the FCC relaxed certain ownership rules. In September 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the FCC's 2017 decision. As a result of the Third Circuit's decision, certain changes to the local television ownership rule, which had permitted the common ownership of two television stations in all markets as long as the commonly owned stations were not both among the top-four stations, based on audience share, were eliminated, and the newspaper-broadcast cross ownership and radio-television cross ownership rules were reinstated. In February 2020, the Solicitor General, on behalf of the FCC and the United States, filed a request for a 30-day extension within which to file a Petition for writ of certiorari requesting the Supreme Court to review the Third Circuit's decision. The FCC's rules also define the types of positions and interests that are considered attributable for purposes of the ownership limits. In general, officers, directors and stockholders holding 5% or more of the voting interests in Hemisphere are deemed to have attributable interests. The FCC's ownership limits therefore apply to our principals and certain investors in our Company. Because we are controlled by a single stockholder holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock, the FCC's current rules do not treat other five percent or greater voting stockholders as attributable, and those ownership interests are not required to be reported to the FCC. 
         In December 2017, the FCC opened a notice of proposed rulemaking to review the national television audience reach cap and the 50% discount that is given to UHF stations in determining compliance with the national audience cap. That proposed rulemaking remains pending as of the date of this Annual Report. 
   Local Television Ownership Rule 
         Under the local television ownership rule, one party may own, operate, or control up to two television stations in a market, so long as at least one of the stations is not one of the top four rated stations (based on audience share) in the television market and at least eight independent owners of television stations would remain in the market following a combination. The rule also permits the ownership, operation or control of two television stations in a market as long as the stations' Noise Limited Service contours do not overlap. Broadcast stations designated by the FCC as "satellite" stations are exempt from the local television ownership rule. WNJX TV and WTIN TV have been designated by the FCC as "satellite" stations of WAPA TV, a division of WAPA. The FCC may also waive its local television ownership rule to permit ownership, operation or control of two television stations in a market that would not otherwise be permissible if one of the stations is in involuntary bankruptcy, is a "failed" station, or is "failing" (i.e., stations with negative cash flow and less than a four share all day audience rating). Under the local television ownership rule, the licensee of a television station that provides more than 15% of another in market station's weekly programming or advertising will be deemed to have an attributable interest in the other station. In December 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to launch its statutorily mandated quadrennial review of multiple ownership rules, including the local television ownership rule, to determine whether the rules remain necessary in the public interest. The rulemaking remains pending. 
 Radio Television Cross Ownership Rule 
         The radio television cross ownership rule generally allows common ownership of one or two television stations and up to six radio stations, or, in certain circumstances, one television station and 
 21

   up to seven radio stations, in any market where at least 20 independent voices would remain after the combination; two television stations and up to four radio stations in a market where at least 10 independent voices would remain after the combination; and one television and one radio station notwithstanding the number of independent voices in the market. A "voice" generally includes independently owned, same market commercial and noncommercial broadcast television and radio stations, newspapers of certain minimum circulation, and one cable system per market. 
   Newspaper Broadcast Cross Ownership Rule. 
         Under the currently effective newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule, unless grandfathered or subject to waiver, no party can have an attributable interest in both a daily English-language newspaper and either a television or radio station in the same market. 
 Attribution of Ownership 
         Pursuant to FCC rules, the following relationships and interests are generally considered attributable for purposes of broadcast ownership restrictions: (i) all officers and directors of a corporate licensee and its direct or indirect parent(s); (ii) voting stock interests of at least five percent; (iii) voting stock interests of at least 20 percent, if the holder is a passive institutional investor (such as an investment company, bank, or insurance company); (iv) any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company, unless properly "insulated" from management activities; (v) equity and/or debt interests that in the aggregate exceed 33 percent of a licensee's total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15 percent of the station's total weekly programming or is a same-market broadcast company or daily newspaper publisher; (vi) time brokerage of a broadcast station by a same-market broadcast company; and (vii) same-market radio joint sales agreements. Because we are controlled by a single stockholder holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock, the FCC's current rules do not treat other five percent or greater voting stockholders as attributable, and those ownership interests are not required to be reported to the FCC. Pending before the FCC is a proposal to eliminate the single majority shareholder exception. The FCC is also considering a proposal to require the disclosure in biennial ownership reports of information about five percent or greater voting shareholders, even if such interests are not attributable under the FCC's ownership rules. 
         Management services agreements and other types of shared services arrangements between same-market stations that do not include attributable time brokerage components generally are not deemed attributable under the FCC's current ownership rules. However, the FCC now requires that television stations make any shared services agreements available in a station's public inspection file. 
   Commission Approval of Transfer of Control of FCC Licenses 
         The FCC's prior approval is required for the transfer of control or assignment of FCC licenses. We are currently controlled by Gato Investments LP ("Gato"), which owns a majority of our Class B common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Class B common stock"). The FCC's prior consent would be required prior to any transaction that would result in a change in control of Hemisphere or Gato. An application for consent to a transfer of control or assignment of licenses would be subject to a formal public notice and comment period during which petitions to deny the applications would be accepted by the FCC. 
         A person or entity requesting the FCC's consent to acquire or obtain control of our television station licenses must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC's ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the public interest. As discussed above, we own two television stations, WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV, which are operated as "satellite" stations of WAPA-TV. Stations granted satellite status are exempt from the FCC's local television ownership rule. Thus, this status permits the common ownership of the three WAPA broadcast stations that would not otherwise be permitted. 
 22

   WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV were first accorded satellite status in 2001 due to the unique circumstances of the Puerto Rico market, including its topography and economic conditions, and the FCC has renewed this grant in subsequent transactions. We anticipate the FCC would continue to grant satellite status to WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV in future change-in-control transactions. 
   Foreign Ownership Restrictions 
         Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any corporation that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities, whom the FCC refers to as "aliens," or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. 
         Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the capital stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations, if the FCC finds the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be granted to or held by any such entity. In the past, the FCC has made such an affirmative finding with respect to broadcast licenses only in highly limited circumstances. In 2013, however, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling that notwithstanding its past practices, it will consider on a case-by-case basis requests for approval of acquisitions by aliens of in excess of 25% of the capital stock of the parent of a broadcast licensee. In 2016, the FCC adopted rules to simplify the process for submitting a declaratory ruling and modifying the procedures for the foreign ownership approval process for broadcast station licensees. In acting upon a request for declaratory ruling, the FCC will coordinate with Executive Branch agencies on national security, law enforcement, foreign policy and trade policy issues. The new rules also specify how public companies should monitor foreign ownership compliance and provide for remedial provisions in the event a public company determines that it has exceeded its foreign ownership limits. 
         On January 18, 2017, the FCC granted our request to allow non-U.S. investors to own up to 49.99% of our capital stock and hold 49.99% of our voting power. Subsequently, on September 18, 2018, the FCC granted approval of additional specific non-U.S. equity and/or voting ownership interests in excess of 5%. On November 19, 2019, the FCC approved up to 100% aggregate non-U.S. ownership of our equity and voting interests and approved the ownership by any one of a list of certain non-U.S. investors of up to 49.99% of our capital stock and/or voting power. However, we remain subject to the requirement to obtain specific approval from the FCC before any alien acquires more than 5% of our capital stock or more than 5% voting rights, other than certain non-U.S. investors that the FCC has previously approved in the series of declaratory rulings identified above. We are also required to notify the FCC and take remedial actions if necessary, if we determine that an unapproved alien has acquired more than 5% of our capital stock or voting rights, and we may be subject to FCC enforcement action, including monetary forfeitures, if such a circumstance occurs. 
         To the extent necessary to comply with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, and the declaratory rulings, our board of directors may (i) prohibit the ownership, voting or transfer of any portion of our outstanding capital stock to the extent the ownership, voting or transfer of such portion would cause us to violate or would otherwise result in violation of any provision of the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC's declaratory ruling; (ii) convert shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC's declaratory rulings; and (iii) redeem capital stock to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the 
 23

   Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC's declaratory rulings or to prevent the loss or impairment of any of our FCC licenses. 
   Digital Television 
         As of June 12, 2009, all full-power broadcast television stations were required to cease broadcasting analog programming and convert to all digital broadcasts. Digital broadcasting allows stations to offer digital channels for a wide variety of services such as high definition video programming, multiple channels of standard definition video programming, such as WAPA Deportes, data, and other types of communications. Each station is required to provide at least one free over-the-air video program signal. 
         To the extent a station has "excess" digital capacity (i.e., digital capacity not used to transmit free, over-the-air video programming), it may elect to use that capacity in any manner consistent with FCC technical requirements, including for data transmission, interactive or subscription video services, or paging and information services. If a station uses its digital capacity to provide any such "ancillary or supplementary" services on a subscription or otherwise "feeable" basis, it must pay the FCC an annual fee equal to 5% of the gross revenues realized from such services. 
         In 2017, the FCC adopted rules authorizing the deployment of the Next Generation broadcast television transmission standard, also called ATSC 3.0. ATSC 3.0 is an Internet Protocol-based broadcast transmission platform that merges the capabilities of over-the-air broadcasting with the broadband viewing and information delivery methods of the Internet, using the same 6 MHz channels presently allocated for digital television service. Stations are not obligated to use ATSC 3.0; use of the new standard is voluntary. We cannot predict what impact the new standard will have on our Business. 
   MVPD Retransmission of Local Television Signals 
         A number of provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules govern aspects of the relationship between broadcast television stations and distributors of multiple channels of video programming such as cable, satellite and telecommunications companies (referred to as "MVPDs"). The rules generally provide certain protections for local broadcast stations, for which MVPDs are an important means of distribution and a provider of competing program channels. 
         To ensure that every local television station can be received in its local market without requiring a cable subscriber to switch between cable and off-air signals, the FCC allows every full-power television broadcast station to require that all local cable systems and direct broadcast satellite transmit that station's primary digital channel to their subscribers within the station's market (the so-called "must-carry" rule). Alternatively, a station may elect to forego its must-carry rights and seek a negotiated agreement to establish the terms of its carriage by a local MVPDreferred to as "retransmission consent." A station electing retransmission consent assumes the risk that it will not be able to strike a deal with the MVPD and will not be carried. A station has the opportunity to elect must-carry or retransmission consent every three years. Elections were made in October 2017 for the 2018-2020 three-year period. WAPA elected retransmission consent and has entered into retransmission consent contracts with all MVPD systems serving Puerto Rico. 
         MVPDs are not required to carry any programming streams other than a station's primary video programming channel. Consequently, WAPA's multicast channel WAPA Deportes is not entitled to mandatory carriage under the FCC's must-carry rules. However, we are free to negotiate with MVPDs for the carriage of additional programming streams. 
         In 2014, the FCC adopted rules prohibiting a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top four stations to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another station, if the stations are not commonly owned and serve the same geographic market. Congress tightened this restriction to prohibit 
 24

   joint negotiation with any television station in the same market unless the stations are under common de jure control as part of the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 enacted in December 2019 made permanent the statutory requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate retransmission agreements in good faith, which had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2019. In December 2014, the FCC issued a NPRM requesting comment on whether the definition of MVPD should be expanded to include providers that make multiple linear streams of video programming available for purchase, regardless of the technology used to distribute the programming (e.g. entities providing video programming to subscribers through internet connections). The FCC also has pending rulemaking proceedings to review certain aspects of the retransmission consent negotiation rules, including one of the standards used to evaluate whether broadcast stations and MVPDs are negotiating for retransmission consent in good faith, referred to as the "totality of the circumstances test." We cannot predict what impact, if any, they will have on our negotiations with video programming distributors. 
   Repurposing of Broadcast Spectrum for Other Uses 
         Federal legislation was enacted in February 2012 that, among other things, authorized the FCC to conduct voluntary "incentive auctions" in order to reallocate certain spectrum currently occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, to "repack" television stations into a smaller portion of the existing television spectrum band, and to require television stations that did not relinquish spectrum in the auction to modify their transmission facilities, subject to reimbursement for reasonable relocation costs up to an industry-wide total of $1.75 billion. 
         The FCC adopted rules concerning the incentive auction and the repacking of the television band and conducted the auction. The incentive auction concluded in the first half of 2017. The FCC is now in the process of "repacking" the remaining television broadcast spectrum, which requires that certain television stations that did not relinquish spectrum in the auction modify their transmission facilities, including requiring such stations to operate on other channel designations. The FCC will reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs. The original reimbursement limit across all stations was $1.75 billion. In March 2018, Congress authorized an additional $1 billion to be used for reimbursements related to repacking. When repacking, the FCC will make reasonable efforts to preserve a station's coverage area and population served. Stations WNJX TV and WTIN TV have been reassigned new channels as a result of the incentive auction. WNJX TV and WTIN TV transitioned to their new channels on August 1, 2018 and are currently operating with temporary facilities while construction of their permanent facilities is completed. 
         The outcome of the repacking of broadcast television spectrum and the impact of such on WAPA's business, cannot be predicted. Nevertheless, we do not believe that the auction will have a material negative impact on our Business, because with post-auction channel assignments our stations will remain in the more desirable UHF band; our three television stations have overlapping coverage areas, so it is unlikely that we will lose service to a significant portion of the households that we serve. If the FCC is unable to reimburse all of our repacking expenses, the amount of the shortfall is unlikely to be material to our Business as a whole. 
   EEO Rules 
         The FCC's Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") rules impose job information dissemination, recruitment, documentation and reporting requirements on broadcast television stations. Broadcasters are also subject to random audits to ensure compliance with the FCC's EEO rules and may be sanctioned for noncompliance. 
 25

     Recordkeeping 
         The FCC rules require broadcast television stations to maintain various records regarding operations, including equipment performance records and a log of the station's operating parameters. Television stations must also maintain a public inspection file, which is hosted on an FCC maintained website and is therefore widely accessible by members of the public and the FCC. The FCC has recently increased enforcement of requirements regarding online public inspection files. 
 Programming and Operations 
         Rules and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies regulate certain programming practices and other areas affecting the business or operations of broadcast stations, including WAPA, and cable networks, including our U.S. Networks. 
         Obscenity, Indecency and Profanity.    Federal statutes prohibit the broadcast or transmission of obscene material at any time by broadcast television stations and on cable networks, including our U.S. Networks. The FCC's rules also prohibit television stations, including the WAPA station, from broadcasting indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. In recent years, the FCC has intensified its enforcement activities with respect to programming it considers indecent and has issued numerous fines to licensees found to have violated the indecency rules. 
         In 2019, the FCC implemented increased forfeiture amounts for indecency violations that were enacted by Congress. The maximum permitted fine for an indecency violation is $414,454 per incident and $3,825,726 for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. 
         Because the FCC may investigate indecency complaints on an ex parte basis, a licensee may not have knowledge of an indecency complaint unless and until the complaint results in the issuance of a formal FCC letter of inquiry or notice of apparent liability for forfeiture. In July 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision finding that the FCC's indecency standard was too vague for broadcasters to interpret and therefore inconsistent with the First Amendment. In June 2011, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in this case. In June 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision which held that the FCC could not fine ABC and FOX (two television networks that were fined for airing allegedly indecent material) for the specific broadcasts at issue because the FCC had not provided them with sufficient notice of its intent to issue fines for the use of fleeting expletives or momentary nudity. However, the Supreme Court did not make any substantive ruling regarding the FCC's current indecency policies. In April 2013, the FCC requested comments on its indecency policy, including whether to ban the use of fleeting expletives or whether it should only impose fines from broadcasts that involve repeated and deliberate use of expletives. The FCC has advised that it will continue to pursue enforcement actions in egregious cases while it conducts its review of its indecency policy generally. 
         Children's Programming.    Federal statutes and FCC rules require broadcast television stations, including the WAPA station, to broadcast three hours per week of educational and informational programming ("E/I programming") designed for children 16 years of age and younger. In July 2019, the FCC adopted revisions to the children's television programming rules, including the elimination of the requirement to air children's programming on multicast programming streams, the expansion of the time period during which such programming can air, and requiring reporting to the FCC of such programming on an annual rather than a quarterly basis. 
         Federal statutes and FCC rules also limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be included in programming primarily produced and carried for children 12 years and younger by broadcast television stations and cable networks, including our U.S. Networks. The FCC's rules also limit the display, during children's programming on broadcast stations and cable networks, of Internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products. 
 26



 Commercial Loudness.    The 2010 Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act ("CALM Act") and the FCC rules implementing the CALM Act, require television stations, cable television operators, satellite television providers, and other pay television providers to limit the average volume of commercials, including promotional announcements, to the same average volume as the programming it accompanies. The FCC rules do not specifically require video programming providers, such as our U.S. Networks, to comply with the rules regarding the loudness of commercials. However, video programming distributors may request or require by contract that programming providers certify compliance with those rules for commercials embedded in programming. 
  Closed Captioning.    FCC rules require the majority of programming broadcast by television stations and carried on cable networks to contain closed captions. In January 2012, the FCC adopted rules to require that television programming broadcast by television stations or transmitted by cable, including on our U.S. Networks, with captioning include captioning if subsequently made available online, for example, by streaming on WAPA.TV. Clips of programming carried on television are required to be captioned if subsequently distributed over the internet. Additionally, beginning in March 2015, new FCC rules became effective that require programming captions to adhere to more stringent quality standards. In 2016, rules became effective requiring certain clips of programming made available online to be captioned if the underlying programming aired on television with captions. 
         Sponsorship Identification.    Both the Communications Act and the FCC's rules generally require that, when payment or other consideration has been received or promised to a broadcast television station for the airing of program material, the station must disclose that fact and identify who paid or promised to provide the consideration at the time of broadcast. Cable systems are subject to the same requirement when the system is originating programming, also known as cablecasting. 
   Program Access Restrictions 
         Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers are generally prohibited from offering different prices, terms, or conditions to competing multichannel video programming distributors unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC's regulations. The FCC's "program access" rules previously limited the ability of a vertically integrated cable programmer to enter into exclusive distribution arrangements with cable television operators. However, in 2012, the FCC declined to extend the exclusive contract prohibition section of the program access rules beyond its October 5, 2012 sunset date. A cable programmer is considered to be vertically integrated if it owns or is owned by a cable television operator, in whole or in part, under the FCC's program access attribution rules. Cable television operators for this purpose may include telephone companies that provide video programming directly to subscribers. Because certain of our directors are also directors of cable companies, we are considered to be a vertically integrated cable programmer and are subject to the program access rules. 
   Regulation of the Internet 
         Internet services, including WAPA.TV, CINELATINO.COM, TVPASIONES.COM, CENTROAMERICATV.TV, TELEVISIONDOMINICANA.TV and SNAPTV.TV, are subject to regulation in the U.S. relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13, including the federal Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM). In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal, state, territorial laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. 
 27

     Other Regulations 
         In addition to the regulations applicable to the broadcast, cable television and Internet industries in general, we are also subject to other federal, state, territorial, and local regulations, including, without limitation, regulations promulgated by federal, state, and territorial environmental, health and labor agencies. Cinelatino is also subject to laws and regulations that may be adopted or promulgated by the governments of other jurisdictions in which it operates.

      Item 1A.    Risk Factors. 
        The following risk factors and the forward-looking statements disclaimer elsewhere herein should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our Business and our subsidiaries. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those anticipated. Many of the risk factors described under one heading below may apply to more than one section in which we have grouped them for the purpose of this presentation. As a result, you should consider all of the following factors, together with all of the other information presented herein, in evaluating our Business and our subsidiaries and the joint ventures and investments they enter into. These risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time in future filings and reports that we file with the Commission in the future. 
 Risk Factors Related to our Business 
   Service providers could discontinue or refrain from carrying our Networks, decide not to renew their distribution agreements or renew on less favorable terms, which could substantially reduce the number of viewers and harm our Business and operating results. 
         Consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers, including our Networks. Some of our largest Distributors are combining and have gained, or may gain, market power, which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms. In addition, many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our Networks also have a small number of dominant Distributors. The success of each of our Networks is dependent, in part, on our ability to enter into new carriage agreements and maintain or renew existing agreements or arrangements with Distributors. Although 
 28

   our Networks currently have arrangements or agreements with, and are being carried by, many of the largest Distributors, having such a relationship or agreement with a Distributor does not always ensure that the Distributors will continue to carry our Networks. Additionally, under our Cable Networks' current contracts and arrangements, we typically offer Distributors the right to transmit the programming services comprising our Cable Networks to their subscribers, but not all such contracts or arrangements require that the programming services comprising our Cable Networks be offered to all subscribers of, or any specific tiers of, or to a specific minimum number of subscribers of a Distributor. Also, WAPA is dependent on its retransmission consent agreements that provide for per subscriber fees with annual rate escalators. No assurances can be provided that WAPA will be able to renegotiate all such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. A failure to secure a renewal of our Networks' agreements, or a renewal on less favorable terms may result in a reduction in our Business's affiliate fees and advertising revenues, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 
   The success of our Business is dependent upon advertising revenue, which is seasonal and cyclical, and will also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
         The success of our Business is dependent upon our advertising revenues. Our Networks' ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:
 

 economic conditions in the markets in which our Networks operate; 
 the popularity of the programming offered by our Networks; 
 changes in the population demographics in the markets in which our Networks operate; 
 advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the popularity of programming, the availability of programming, and the relative
supply of and demand for commercial advertising; 
 our competitors' activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly MVPD operators, digital
platforms, and the internet; 
 decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason; 
 labor disputes or other disruptions at major advertisers; 
 changes in audience ratings, including Nielsen's ability to provide ratings; and 
 other factors beyond our control. 

         Audience ratings may be impacted by a number of factors outside of our control, including a decline in viewership, changes in ratings technology or methodology or changes in household sampling. For example, as a result of the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, Nielsen suspended reporting of ratings data in Puerto Rico in September 2017 through May 1, 2018. Any decline in audience ratings could cause revenue to decline, adversely impacting our Business and our operating results. Our advertising revenue and results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations that we expect to continue. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher operating income in the fourth quarter than in the first, second, and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers' increased expenditures in anticipation of the holiday season spending. In addition, we typically experience an increase in revenue every four years as a result of advertising sales in respect of local government elections in Puerto Rico. The next political election year will be 2020. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue, and the historically significant increase in our revenue during election years, investors are cautioned that it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations. 
 29

     If our Networks' viewership declines for any reason, or our audience ratings decline for any reason or our Networks fail to develop and distribute popular programs, our advertising and subscriber fee revenues could decrease. 
         Our Networks' viewership and audience ratings, as applicable, are critical factors affecting both (i) the advertising revenue that we receive, and (ii) the extent of affiliate revenue we receive, as applicable, under agreements with our Distributors. Our ratings are dependent, in part, on our ability to consistently create and acquire programming that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general and viewers in our Networks' target demographic category. 
         Our Networks' viewership is also affected by the quality and acceptance of competing programs and other content offered by other networks, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, including general economic conditions, piracy, digital and on-demand distribution and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending. Audience ratings may be impacted by a number of factors outside of our control, including a decline in viewership, changes in ratings technology or methodology or changes in household sampling. Any decline in our Networks' viewership or audience ratings could cause advertising revenue to decline, subscription revenues to fall, and adversely impact our Business and operating results. 
   Our Networks may not be able to grow their subscribers and/or affiliate revenue, or such subscribers and/or revenues may decline and, as a result, our revenues and profitability may not increase and could decrease. 
         The growth of our Networks' subscriber base depends upon many factors, such as overall growth in cable, satellite and telco subscribers, the popularity of our Networks' programming, our ability to negotiate new carriage agreements, or amendments to, or renewals of, current carriage agreements, maintenance of existing distribution, and the success of our marketing efforts in driving consumer demand for their content, as well as other factors that are beyond our control, including temporary and permanent migration shifts in Puerto Rico, particularly following Hurricane Maria and recent earthquakes. 
         A major component of our financial growth strategy is based on our ability to increase our Cable Networks' subscriber base. If our Cable Networks' programming services are required by the FCC to be offered on an "à la carte" basis, our Cable Networks could experience higher costs, reduced distribution of our program service, perhaps significantly, and lose viewers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase our Cable Networks' subscriber base on cable, satellite and telco systems or that our current carriage will not decrease as a result of a number of factors or that we will be able to maintain or increase our Cable Networks' current subscriber fee rates. 
         In particular, negotiations for new carriage agreements, or amendments to, or renewals of, current carriage agreements, are lengthy and complex, and our Networks are not able to predict with any accuracy when such increases in our subscriber bases may occur, if at all, or if we can maintain or increase our current affiliate fees, as applicable. If our Networks are unable to grow our subscriber bases or if we reduce our affiliate fees, as applicable, our revenues may not increase and could decrease. 
   Demand for our programming and our Business, financial condition and results of operations are affected by changes that impact Hispanic living in the United States. 
         We believe one of our growth drivers will result from projected increases in the U.S. Hispanic population and projected increases in their buying power. Factors that impact the U.S. Hispanic population, including a slowdown in immigration into the U.S. in the future, the impact of federal and state immigration legislation and policies on both the U.S. Hispanic population and persons emigrating from Latin America could affect the growth of the U.S. Hispanic population and, as a result, the demand for our programming. Immigration reform has been a continued area of focus for the current 
 30

   U.S. presidential administration. In 2017, a series of executive orders temporarily banning travel to the U.S. from several countries in the Middle East and Africa were signed into order. Additionally in 2017, the Department of Homeland Security issued several guidance memos that expand the federal government's ability to empower state and local law enforcement agencies to perform the functions of immigration officers and provide federal immigration agents wide latitude to arrest, detain and deport undocumented immigrants and legal immigrants with criminal records, which may disproportionally affect immigrants from Latin America. In 2018 and 2019, immigration reform continued to attract significant attention in the public arena and the U.S. Congress, including as a result of the administration's "zero tolerance" family separation policy along the U.S. border with Mexico. Although the details and timing of potential changes to immigration law are difficult to predict, restrictions on travel and eligibility for U.S. visa programs may lead to a slowdown of projected immigration levels in the U.S. Hispanic population. Furthermore, U.S. Hispanics might choose not to participate in the census, which would result in the U.S. Hispanic population to be underreported. If the U.S. Hispanic population grows more slowly than anticipated, the projected buying power of the U.S. Hispanic population may not grow as anticipated. In addition, economic conditions, such as unemployment, that disproportionately impact the U.S. Hispanic population could slow the growth of, or reduce, the projected buying power of U.S. Hispanics. If the U.S. Hispanic population or its buying power grows more slowly than anticipated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         In addition, in the U.S. we exclusively target our Hispanic audience through Spanish-language programming. As U.S. Hispanics become bilingual or English-dominant, demand for our Spanish-language programming could be adversely impacted by competing English-language programming, including programming primarily in English-language targeting the bilingual or English-dominant U.S. Hispanic population. In addition, a shift in policy towards encouraging English-language fluency among U.S. Hispanic immigrants could also impact demand for Spanish-language programming. If we are unable to create more programming and networks targeted to this audience, we may lose audience share to competing English-language or bilingual programming which could lead to lower ratings and consequently, lower advertising revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   The television markets in which our Networks operate is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively, particularly against competitors with greater financial resources, brand recognition, marketplace presence and relationships with service providers. 
         Our Networks compete with other television channels for the distribution of their programming, development and acquisition of content, audience viewership and advertising sales. With respect to audiences, television stations compete primarily based on program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs our Networks broadcast. Further, because our Networks compete for the rights to produce or license certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to produce or obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs on our Networks, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of significant increases in programming alternatives and the failure to compete with new technological innovations could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our Business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
         Our Networks compete with other Spanish-language broadcast and cable television networks, and digital media companies for the acquisition of programming, viewership, the sale of advertising, and creative talent. Our Networks also compete for the development and acquisition of programming, selling of commercial time on our Networks and on-air and creative talent. It is possible that our competitors, many of which have substantially greater financial and operational resources than our 
 31

   Networks, could revise their programming to offer more competitive programming which is of interest to our Networks' viewers. 
         Additionally, our Cable Networks compete with other television channels to be included in the offerings of each video service provider and for placement in the packaged offerings having the most subscribers. For example, our Cable Networks' ability to secure distribution is dependent upon the production, acquisition and packaging of programming, audience viewership, and the prices charged for carriage. Our Cable Networks' contractual agreements with Distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. With respect to WAPA, OTT and cable network programming, combined with increased access to cable and satellite TV, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. 
         Our Networks also compete for advertising revenue with general-interest television and other forms of media, including magazines, newspapers, radio and digital media. Our ability to secure additional advertising accounts relating to our Networks' operations depends upon the size of each Networks' audience, the popularity of our programming and the demographics of our viewers, as well as strategies taken by our Networks' competitors, strategies taken by advertisers and the relative bargaining power of advertisers. Competition for advertising accounts and related advertising expenditures is intense. We face competition for such advertising expenditures from a variety of sources, including other networks and other media. We cannot provide assurance that our Networks' advertising sponsors will pay advertising rates for commercial air time at levels sufficient for us to make a profit, that we will maintain relationships with our current advertising sponsors or that we will be able to attract new advertising sponsors or increase advertising revenues. Changes in ratings technology, or methodology or metrics used by advertisers or other changes in advertisers' media buying strategies also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to attract advertising accounts in sufficient quantities, our revenues and profitability may be harmed. 
         Certain technological advances, including the increased deployment of fiber optic cable, are expected to allow cable and telecommunication video service providers to continue to expand both their channel and broadband distribution capacities and to increase transmission speeds. In addition, the ability to deliver content via new methods and devices is expected to increase substantially. The impact of such added capacities is hard to predict, but the development of new methods of content distribution could dilute our Networks' market share and lead to increased competition for viewers by facilitating the emergence of additional channels and mobile and internet platforms through which viewers could view programming that is similar to that offered by our Networks. 
         If any of our existing competitors or new competitors, many of which have substantially greater financial and operational resources than our Networks, significantly expand their operations or their market penetration, our Business could be harmed. If any of these competitors were able to invent improved technology, or our Networks were not able to prevent them from obtaining and using their own proprietary technology and trade secrets, our Business and operating results, as well as our Networks' future growth prospects, could be negatively affected. There can be no assurance that our Networks will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our Business, financial condition or results of operations. 
   Interpretation of certain terms of our distribution agreements may have an adverse effect on the distribution payments we receive under those agreements. 
         Many of our distribution agreements contain "most favored nation" clauses. These clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another Distributor which contains certain more favorable terms, we must offer some of those terms to our existing Distributors. While we believe that 
 32

   we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements, these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that, if correct, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 
   Our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms. 
         Our Networks enter into long-term contracts for acquisition of programming, including movies, television series, sporting rights and other programs. As these contracts expire, our Networks must renew or renegotiate these contracts, and if our Networks are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including effectiveness of marketing efforts, the size of audiences and the strength of advertising markets. There can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of distributing the programming. 
   There has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content, which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our Business in unpredictable ways. Our Networks' failure to acquire or maintain state-of-the-art technology or adapt our business models may harm our Business and competitive advantage. 
         Technology in the video, telecommunications and data services industry is changing rapidly. Consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable. Consumers are increasingly viewing content on a time-delayed or on-demand basis from traditional distributors and from connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens, such as televisions, tablets, mobile phones and other devices. Additionally, devices that allow users to view television programs on a time-shifted basis and technologies that enable users to fast-forward or skip programming, including commercials, such as DVRs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues. There is increased demand for short-form, user-generated and interactive content, which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings. Digital downloads, rights lockers, rentals and subscription services are competing for consumer preferences with each other and with traditional physical distribution of our content. Each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us, so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not completely predictable. Distribution windows are also evolving, potentially affecting revenues from other windows. We may be required to incur substantial capital expenditures to implement new technologies, or, if we fail to do so, may face significant new challenges due to technological advances adopted by competitors, which in turn could result in harm to our Business and operating results. Additionally, the development of new methods of content distribution could dilute our Networks' market share and lead to increased competition for viewers. If we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences, our Business could be adversely affected. 
         Certain digital video recording technologies offered by cable and satellite systems allow viewers to digitally record, store and play back television programming at a later time and may impact our advertising revenue. Most of these technologies permit viewers to fast forward through advertisements; or, in certain cases, skip them entirely. The use of these technologies may decrease viewership of commercials as recorded by media measurement services such as Nielsen and, as a result, lower the 
 33

   advertising revenues of our television stations. The current ratings provided by Nielsen for use by linear content providers are limited to live viewing plus viewing of a digitally recorded program in the same week as the original air date and give broadcasters no credit for delayed viewing that occurs after the same week as the original air date. The effects of new ratings system technologies including people meters and set-top boxes, and the ability of such technologies to be a reliable standard that can be used by advertisers is currently unknown. 
   We face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our programming services, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses. 
         Our information technology systems, including our online, mobile and app offering, as well as our internal systems, are susceptible to security breaches, operational data loss, general disruptions in functionality, and may not be compatible with new technology. We depend on our information technology systems for the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our Networks' customers, as well as to maintain financial records and accuracy. Any theft or misuse of confidential, personally identifiable or proprietary information could disrupt our business and result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of competitive information, difficulty in marketing our products, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition. Interruptions in our operations and services or disruptions to the functionality provided by our Networks could adversely impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us. In addition, our business would be harmed if any of the events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. 
         Although we have systems in place to monitor our security measures, disruption or failures of our and our subsidiaries' information technology systems, due to employee error, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, or otherwise, could impair our ability to effectively and timely provide services and products and maintain our financial records. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information, which may include user data, a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services, damage to our brands and reputation, a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services, and significant legal and financial exposure, each of which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our Business. 
   Cable, satellite and telco television programming signals have been stolen or could be stolen in the future, which reduces our potential revenue from subscriber fees and advertising. 
         The delivery of subscription programming requires the use of conditional access technology to limit access to programming to only those who subscribe to programming and are authorized to view it. Conditional access systems use, among other things, encryption technology to protect the transmitted signal from unauthorized access. It is illegal to create, sell or otherwise distribute software or devices to circumvent conditional access technologies. However, theft of programming has been widely reported, 
 34

   and the access or "smart" cards used in service providers' conditional access systems have been compromised and could be further compromised in the future. When conditional access systems are compromised, our Networks do not receive the potential subscriber fee revenues from the service providers. Further, measures that could be taken by service providers to limit such theft are not under our control. While we take proactive steps to combat piracy through the encryption of our signal and other measures, there can be no assurances that these or other steps are effective. Piracy of our Networks' copyrighted materials could reduce our revenue and negatively affect our Business and operating results. 
   We have operations, properties and viewers that are located in Puerto Rico and Florida and could be adversely affected in the event of a hurricane or other extreme weather conditions. 
         WAPA's corporate office and production facilities are located in Puerto Rico, where major hurricanes have occurred, as well as other extreme weather conditions, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, fires, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves. Additionally, our corporate office and certain of our operations provided by our service providers are located in Miami, Florida, where similar weather conditions have occurred, including major hurricanes. Depending on where any particular hurricane, earthquake or other weather event makes landfall, our properties or those of our service providers could experience significant damage. Such event could have an adverse effect on our ability to broadcast our programming or produce new shows, which could have an adverse effect on our Business and results of operations. Additionally, many of WAPA's regular viewers may be left without power and unable to view our programming which could have an adverse effect on our Business and results of operations. 
         In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes in early 2020 and Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. As a result, business may be reluctant to establish or expand their operations in Puerto Rico and/or reduce spending on advertising. Such extreme weather conditions can also have impacts on our operations and properties. For example, Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused substantial damage to property and infrastructure in Puerto Rico, including limited damage to our studios and offices and to two of our three transmission towers and significant damage beyond repair to the third of our transmission towers. While WAPA-TV is not currently operating from its FCC-licensed facilities, we have modified the WAPA-TV facilities to broadcast over-the-air, and have received authorization from the FCC to construct modified facilities for WAPA-TV at a new transmitter site. WAPA-TV is operating from the new site with interim facilities until construction of the permanent facilities is completed. The hurricanes destroyed residential and commercial buildings, agriculture, communications networks and most of Puerto Rico's electric grid. There can be no assurances in the future that we have adequate insurance coverage to mitigate future losses from such extreme weather conditions. Following the hurricanes, there was a steep drop off in advertising revenue in Puerto Rico. There was also significant impact on affiliate fees in Puerto Rico for the year ended December 31, 2017 and continued impact to the advertising market in 2018. Finally, as a result of the hurricanes and earthquakes, a significant number of citizens have left, or may leave, Puerto Rico, and there can be no assurance about when they will return, if at all. As a result, the disruption from the storms and earthquakes, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the timing of the recovery and possible declines in television households, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 
   Puerto Rico's continuing economic hardships may have a negative effect on the overall performance of our Business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         Financial and economic conditions in Puerto Rico have further deteriorated and continue to be uncertain. The continuation or worsening of such conditions could have an adverse effect on our Business, results of operations, and/or financial condition. 
 35

           The Puerto Rican economy has been and continues to be in a recession since 2006, and has been burdened by limited economic activity, lower-than-estimated revenue collections, high government debt levels relative to the size of the economy and other potential fiscal challenges. Moreover, Hurricane Maria caused a significant disruption to the island's economic activity and GNP. For more information on the Puerto Rican economy, see "IndustryPuerto Rico OverviewEconomy". 
         Additionally, Puerto Rico's track record of poor budget controls and high poverty levels compared to the U.S. average presents ongoing challenges. Although some of the impact of the hurricanes, including its short-term impact on economic activity, may be offset by recovery and reconstruction activity and the influx of Federal emergency funds and private insurance proceeds, it is too early to know the total amount of Federal and private insurance money to be received and whether such transfers will significantly offset the negative economic, fiscal and demographic impact of the hurricanes. On February 29, 2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico submitted a revised fiscal plan to the Financial Oversight and Management Board of Puerto Rico ("FOMB"). According to the submitted fiscal plan, Puerto Rico's GNP grew 2.4% in the Puerto Rico government's Fiscal Year 2019, which ended June 30, 2019, and is predicted to grow 0.4% for Fiscal Year 2020 and to decline 1.5% for Fiscal Year 2021. This more conservative estimate assumes a slower roll-out of federal funds to the island. The revised fiscal plan estimate has not yet been approved by the FOMB. Congress has approved almost $44 billion for recovery from Hurricane Maria between FEMA and HUD. About $8 billion of that money was used for emergency recovery during the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Of the remaining $36 billion, it is expected that $16 billion will be used for recovery through FEMA and the rest of the funds would come from HUD. Only a small percentage of this remaining aid has been disbursed into the projects they were intended to fund and remain on hold pending approvals of the use of funds. The extent and duration of such aid is inherently uncertain. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any past or new actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will achieve their intended effect. 
         Hurricane Maria also accelerated the outmigration trends that Puerto Rico was experiencing, with increased numbers of residents moving to the mainland United States, either on a temporary or permanent basis and recent earthquakes may trigger further outflows in 2020. 
         In addition to any negative direct consequences to our Business or results of operations arising from these financial, economic and climate developments, some of these actions may adversely affect our distribution partners, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely. Our Business and results of operations could be negatively affected as a result. 
   Certain of our Cable Networks and the Canal 1 joint venture have international operations and exposures that incur certain risks not found in doing business in the United States. 
         Doing business in foreign countries carries with it certain risks that are not found in doing business in the United States. The risks of doing business in foreign countries that could result in losses against which our Cable Networks are not insured include:
 

 exposure to local economic conditions; 
 potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States; 
 hostility from local populations; 
 significant fluctuations in foreign currency value; 
 the adverse effect of currency exchange controls or other restrictions; 
 restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; 
 the transition away from the London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"); 

 36



 government policies against businesses owned by foreigners; 
 investment restrictions or requirements; 
 expropriations of property; 
 the potential instability of foreign governments and economies; 
 the risk of insurrections; 
 difficulties in collecting revenues and seeking recourse against third parties owing payments to us; 
 withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; 
 changes in taxation structure; and 
 shifting consumer preferences regarding the viewing of video programming. 

         For example, Canal 1 operates solely in Colombia. Although Colombia has a long-standing tradition respecting the rule of law, which has been bolstered in recent years by the present and former government's policies and programs, no assurances can be given that our joint venture's plans and operations will not be adversely affected by future developments in Colombia. Canal 1's operations and activities in Colombia are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties, including the risk of expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, broadcast licenses or other agreements, changes in laws or taxation policies, currency exchange restrictions, and changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations. Future government actions concerning the economy, taxation, or the operation and regulation of national over-the-air broadcast concessions, could have a significant effect on the joint venture. Colombia was home to South America's largest and longest running insurgency, which ended on December 1, 2016 following the government's ratification of a peace treaty with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ("FARC"). While the situation has improved dramatically in recent years, there can be no guarantee that the situation will not again deteriorate. Any increase in kidnapping, gang warfare, homicide and/or terrorist activity in Colombia generally may disrupt supply chains and discourage qualified individuals from being involved with the joint venture's operations. Any changes in regulations or shifts in political attitudes are beyond our control and may adversely affect the joint venture's business. 
         Furthermore, some foreign markets where we operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the U.S. For example, in Colombia, decreases in the growth rate, periods of negative growth, increases in inflation, changes in law, regulation, policy, or future, judicial rulings and interpretations of policies involving exchange controls and other matters such as (but not limited to) currency depreciation, interest rates, taxation and other political or economic developments in or affecting Colombia may affect the overall business environment and may, in turn, adversely impact our joint venture's financial condition and results of operations in the future. Colombia's fiscal deficit and growing public debt could adversely affect the Colombian economy. 
         We also may incur additional expenses as a result of changes, including the imposition of new restrictions, in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business. Acts of terrorism, hostilities, or financial, political, economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 37

     Our Networks are subject to interruptions of distribution as a result of our reliance on broadcast towers, satellites and Distributors for transmission of its programming. A significant interruption in transmission ability could seriously affect our Business and results of operations, particularly if not fully covered by its insurance. 
         Our Networks could experience interruptions of distribution or potentially long-term increased costs of delivery if the ability of broadcast towers, satellites or satellite transponders, or Distributors to transmit our Networks' content is disrupted because of accidents, weather interruptions, governmental regulation, terrorism, or other third party action. For example, see risk factor above, "We have operations, properties and viewers that are located in Puerto Rico and Florida and could be adversely affected in the event of a hurricane or other extreme weather conditions." 
         As protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses and liabilities. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may increase substantially. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane damage can be limited, and coverage for terrorism risks can include broad exclusions. If our Networks were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. 
   The success of much of our Business is dependent upon the retention and performance of on-air talent and program hosts and other key employees. 
         Our Business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our corporate executive team. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us. Our Business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we lose any of these persons and are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements. Additionally, our Networks independently contract with several on-air personalities and hosts with significant loyal audiences in their respective markets. Although our Networks have entered into long-term agreements with some of their key on-air talent and program hosts to protect their interests in those relationships, we can give no assurance that all or any of these persons will remain with our Networks or will retain their audiences. Competition for these individuals is intense and many of these individuals are under no legal obligation to remain with our Networks. Our competitors may choose to extend offers to any of these individuals on terms which our Networks may be unable or unwilling to meet. Furthermore, the popularity and audience loyalty of our Networks' key on-air talent and program hosts is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes. A loss of such popularity or audience loyalty is beyond our control and could limit our Network' ability to generate revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our Business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   We could be adversely affected by strikes or other union job actions. 
         A majority of our employees in Puerto Rico are highly specialized union members who are essential to the production of television programs and news. These employees are covered by our CBAs. Our main CBA expires on May 31, 2022 and covers all of our unionized employees except for three employees covered by the other CBA which expired on June 27, 2019 and we continue to operate under the terms of the CBA. Following the expiration of the term, the Company and UPAGRA continue to engage in active and good faith negotiations. While we believe that we will maintain good working relations with our employees on acceptable terms, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of the expired CBA in a manner acceptable to either party. A strike by, or a lockout of, UPAGRA, which provides personnel essential to the production of television programs, could delay or halt our ongoing production activities. Such a halt or delay, depending on the length of time, could cause a delay or interruption in the programming schedule of certain of our Networks, 
 38

   which could have a material adverse effect on our Business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   We could become obligated to pay additional contributions due to the unfunded vested benefits of a multiemployer pension plan. A future incurrence of withdrawal liability could have a material effect on our results of operations. 
         WAPA makes contributions to the Newspaper Guild International Pension Plan (the "Plan" or "TNGIPP"), a multiemployer pension plan with a plan year end of December 31 that provides defined benefits to certain employees covered by our two CBAs. WAPA's contribution rates to the Plan are generally determined in accordance with the provisions of the CBAs and a rehabilitation plan that was adopted by the TNGIPP. 
         The risks in participating in such a plan are different from the risks of single-employer plans, in the following respects:
 

 Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of any other participating employer. 
 If a participating employer ceases to contribute to a multiemployer plan, the unfunded obligation of the plan allocable to such withdrawing
employer may be borne by the remaining participating employers. 

         WAPA has received Annual Funding Notices, Report of Summary Plan Information, Critical Status Notices ("Notices") and the above-noted Rehabilitation Plan, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("PPA"), from the Plan. The Notices indicate that the Plan actuary has certified that the Plan is in critical and declining status, the "Red Zone", as defined by the PPA and the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 ("MPRA"), due to the projected insolvency of the Plan within the next 19 years. A plan of rehabilitation ("Rehabilitation Plan") was adopted by the Trustees of the Plan ("Trustees") on May 1, 2010 and then updated on November 17, 2015. 
         On May 29, 2010, the Trustees sent WAPA a Notice of Reduction and Adjustment of Benefits Due to Critical Status explaining all changes adopted under the Rehabilitation Plan, including the reduction or elimination of benefits referred to as "adjustable benefits." In connection with the adoption of the Rehabilitation Plan, most of the Plan participating unions and contributing employers (including the Newspaper Guild International and WAPA), agreed to one of the "schedules" of changes as set forth under the Rehabilitation Plan. In 2015, the Plan's Trustee's reviewed the Rehabilitation Plan and the financial projections under the Plan and determined that is was not prudent to continue benefit accruals under the current Plan and that implementation of an updated plan with a new benefit design would be in the best interest of the Plan's participants. 
         WAPA elected the "Preferred Schedule" and executed a Memorandum of Agreement, effective May 27, 2010 (the "MOA") and agreed to the following contribution rate increases: 3.0% beginning on January 1, 2013; an additional 3.0% beginning on January 1, 2014; and an additional 3% beginning on January 1, 2015. On July 14, 2017 WAPA executed an updated MOA under which it agreed to remain a contributing employer to the Plan through May 31, 2022 and to make contributions to the Plan at a fixed rate of $18.03 per week for each WAPA covered employee during such period (i.e., its contributions per employee will not increase during the term of its CBA or through any period during which a new CBA is entered into, if any). 
         The future cost of the Plan depends on a number of factors, including the funding status of the Plan and the ability of other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations. Assets contributed to the Plan are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to the employees of WAPA. While WAPA's pension cost for the Plan is established by the CBA and is fixed for the term of the CBA, the Plan may revise the Rehabilitation Plan to impose additional increased 
 39

   contribution rates and surcharges that could be applicable to future CBAs based on the funded status of the plan and in accordance with the provisions of the Rehabilitation Plan and the PPA. Factors that could impact the funded status of the Plan include investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions. 
         The contributions required under the terms of the CBA and the effect of the Rehabilitation Plan as described above are not anticipated to have a material effect on our results of operations. However, in the event other contributing employers are unable to, or fail to, meet their ongoing funding obligations, the financial impact on WAPA to make future contributions towards any plan underfunding may be material. In addition, if a United States multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5% on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund. 
         If WAPA completely or partially withdrew from the Plan, it would be obligated to pay complete or partial withdrawal liability (which could be material). Under the statutory requirements applicable to withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer pension plan, in the event of a complete withdrawal from the Plan, WAPA would be obligated to make withdrawal liability payments to fund its proportionate share of the Plan's unfunded vested benefits ("UVBs"). WAPA's payment amount for a given year would be determined based on its highest contribution rate (as limited by MPRA) and its highest average contribution hours over a period of three consecutive plan years out of the ten-year period preceding the date of withdrawal. To the extent that the prescribed payment amount was not sufficient to discharge WAPA's share of the Plan's UVBs, WAPA's payment obligation would nevertheless end after 20 years of payments (absent a withdrawal that is part of a mass withdrawal, in which case the annual payments would continue indefinitely or until WAPA paid its share of the Plan's UVBs at the time of withdrawal). 
         Pursuant to the last available notice (for the Plan year ended December 31, 2018), WAPA's contributions to the Plan exceeded 5% of total contributions made to the Plan. For more information, see Note 16, "Retirement Plans" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report. 
   A large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of customers, and the loss of these customers could adversely affect our Business. 
         Our Networks depend upon agreements with a limited number of Distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2019, one of our Distributors accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues. The loss of channel carriage with any significant Distributor, or our inability to renew an affiliation agreement with any significant Distributor on acceptable terms, would have a materially adverse effect on our Business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   If our goodwill or intangibles become impaired, we will be required to recognize a non-cash charge which could have a significant effect on our reported net earnings. 
         A significant portion of our assets consist of goodwill and intangibles. We test our goodwill and intangibles for impairment each year. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill and intangibles and a noncash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a significant effect on our reported net earnings. 
   Our equity method investments' past financial performance may not be indicative of future results. 
         We have equity investments in several entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our percentage 
 40

   ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity. Any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment. In addition, if these entities were to fail and cease operations, we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits. Some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding. 
   Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments. 
         We have and may continue in the future to develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including but not limited to:
 

 difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business; 
 we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend
additional resources to resolve such impasses or potential disputes, including litigation or arbitration; 
 our joint venture partners could have investment and financing goals that are not consistent with our objectives, including the timing, terms
and strategies for any investments, and what levels of debt to incur or carry; 
 our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited; 
 our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their
obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and 
 our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues. 

         Any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our Business, results of operations and financial condition. 
   Our officers, directors, stockholders and their respective affiliates may have a pecuniary interest in certain transactions in which we are involved, and may also compete with us. 
         We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, stockholders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. We may, subject to the terms of our Second Amended Term Loan Facility and applicable law, enter into transactions in which such persons have an interest. In addition, such parties may have an interest in certain transactions such as strategic partnerships or joint ventures in which we may become involved, and may also compete with us. 
   Future acquisitions and dispositions may not require a stockholder vote and may be material to us. 
         Any future acquisitions could be material in size and scope, and our stockholders and potential investors may have virtually no substantive information about any new business upon which to base a decision whether to invest in our Class A common stock. In any event, depending upon the size and structure of any acquisitions, stockholders are generally expected to not have the opportunity to vote on the transaction, and may not have access to any information about any new business until the 
 41

   transaction is completed and we file a report with the Commission disclosing the nature of such transaction and/or business. Similarly, we may effect material dispositions in the future. Even if a stockholder vote is required for any of our future acquisitions, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, our stockholders are allowed to approve such transactions by written consent, which may effectively result in only our controlling stockholder having an opportunity to vote on such transactions. 
   Unrelated third parties may bring claims against us based on the nature and content of information posted on websites maintained by our Networks. 
         Our Networks host, or may host in the future, internet sites that enable individuals to exchange information, generate content, comment on content, and engage in various online activities. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and internationally. Claims may be brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that may be posted online or generated by our Networks' internet site users, including WAPA.TV, CINELATINO.COM, TVPASIONES.COM, CENTROAMERICATV.TV, TELEVISIONDOMINICANA.TV, and SNAPTV.TV. Defenses of such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our Networks' management, our management and other resources. 
   The success of our Business is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. 
         The value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. If those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. There can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce our rights and protect our products, services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy or signal theft. Content piracy and signal theft present a threat to our revenues. 
         The unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. New technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, and increased broadband internet speed and penetration have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our programming content easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. The unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of our operations worldwide, despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights. These developments may require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content. 
         With respect to intellectual property developed by us and rights acquired by us from others, we are subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. Successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights. We are not aware of any challenges to our intellectual property rights that we currently foresee having a material effect on our operations. 
 42

     If we are unable to protect our domain names, our reputation and brands could be adversely affected. 
         We currently hold various domain name registrations relating to our brands. The registration and maintenance of domain names generally are regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to register or maintain relevant domain names. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from registering domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of, our and our subsidiaries trademarks and other proprietary rights. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brands, and make it more difficult for users to find our Business's websites and services. 
   We may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming, costly to defend and result in loss of significant rights. 
         Other parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us, and our Networks' products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, our Business receives letters alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others. Intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and could divert management's attention from our Business. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages to the party claiming infringement or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or desirable terms, if at all. Our failure to license proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our Business. 
   Changes in accounting standards can significantly impact reported operating results. 
         Generally accepted accounting principles, accompanying pronouncements and implementation guidelines for many aspects of our Business, including those related to intangible assets and income taxes, are complex and involve significant judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly change our reported operating results. 
   Our Second Amended Term Loan Facility may limit our financial and operating flexibility. 
         Our Second Amended Term Loan Facility includes financial covenants restricting our subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other payments, make loans and investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or sell assets. These covenants limit our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a portion of cash flow from operations to payments on debt. In addition, such covenants limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we operate. 
   Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. 
         Borrowings under our long-term debt are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income could decrease. In order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, we have entered into and may in the future enter into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments. If we are unable to enter into interest rate swaps, it may adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. 
 43

     Our LIBOR-based Second Amended Term Loan Facility, financing agreements and interest rate swaps may need to be renegotiated if LIBOR ceases to exist, which may affect our interest expense. 
         Our Second Amended Term Loan Facility and interest rate swaps bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our LIBOR-based loans and interest rate swaps extending beyond 2021. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, however, we are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates, such as SOFR, under our Second Amended Term Loan Facility and interest rate swaps, we may incur transaction expenses, significant increases in our debt service obligations and interest expense, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
   Risk Factors Related to Governmental Regulation 
   We are subject to restrictions on foreign (non-U.S.) ownership. 
         Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any corporation that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. 
         Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation that is directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the capital stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations, if the FCC finds the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be granted to or held by any entity exceeding the 25% non-U.S. equity or voting thresholds. 
         On January 18, 2017, the FCC granted our request to allow non-U.S. investors to own up to 49.99% of our capital stock and hold 49.99% of our voting power. Subsequently, on September 18, 2018, the FCC granted approval of additional specific non-U.S. equity and/or voting ownership interests in excess of 5%. On November 19, 2019, the FCC approved up to 100% aggregate non-U.S. ownership of our equity and voting interests and approved the ownership by any one of a list of certain non-U.S. persons of up to 49.99 percent of our capital stock and/or voting power. However, we remain subject to the requirement to obtain specific approval from the FCC before any non-U.S. person acquires more than 5% of our capital stock or more than 5% voting rights, other than certain non-U.S. investors that the FCC has previously approved in the series of declaratory rulings identified above. We are also required to notify the FCC and take remedial actions if necessary, if we determine that any unapproved non-U.S. person has acquired more than 5% of our capital stock or voting rights, and we may be subject to FCC enforcement action, including monetary forfeitures, if such a circumstance occurs. 
         To the extent necessary to comply with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, and the FCC's declaratory ruling, our board of directors may (i) prohibit the ownership, voting or transfer of any portion of our outstanding capital stock to the extent the ownership, voting or transfer of such 
 44

   portion would cause us to violate or would otherwise result in violation of any provision of the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC's declaratory ruling; (ii) convert shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC's declaratory ruling; and (iii) redeem capital stock to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC's declaratory ruling or to prevent the loss or impairment of any of our FCC licenses. 
   Federal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits WAPA's operating flexibility. 
         The ownership, operation and sale of broadcast television stations, such as WAPA, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act. Matters subject to FCC oversight include the assignment of frequency bands for broadcast television; the approval of a television station's frequency, location and operating power; the issuance, renewal, revocation or modification of a television station's FCC license; the approval of changes in the ownership or control of a television station's licensee; the regulation of equipment used by television stations; and the adoption and implementation of regulations and policies concerning the ownership, operation, programming and employment practices of television stations. 
         WAPA depends upon maintaining its broadcast licenses, which are issued by the FCC for a term of eight years and are renewable. Applications to renew the broadcast licenses of all television stations licensed to communities in Puerto Rico, including those associated with WAPA-TV, were renewed in 2013 and will expire on February 1, 2021. We will be required to file renewal applications for each of our Puerto Rico television stations by October 1, 2020. Interested parties may challenge a renewal application. Generally, the FCC renews a broadcast license upon a finding that (i) the broadcast station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC's rules; and (iii) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or other FCC rules, which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. The FCC has the authority to revoke licenses, not renew them, or renew them with conditions, including renewals for less than a full term. Historically, our FCC licenses have been renewed; however, it cannot be assured that our license renewal applications for WAPA in the future will be approved, or that the renewals, if granted, will not include conditions or qualifications that could adversely affect our operations. If WAPA's licenses are not renewed in the future, or are renewed with substantial conditions or modifications (including renewing one or more of our licenses for a term of fewer than eight years), it could prevent us from operating WAPA and generating revenue from it. 
         Furthermore, WAPA's ability to successfully negotiate and renegotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory changes to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. In March 2011, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to consider changes to its rules governing the negotiation of retransmission consent agreements. The FCC concluded that it lacked statutory authority to impose mandatory arbitration or interim carriage obligations in the event of a dispute between broadcasters and pay television operators. In accordance with the STELA Reauthorization Viewer Act of 2014, in 2015, the FCC eliminated the rules which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local television stations during "sweeps" rating periods. The FCC also has pending rulemaking proceedings to review certain aspects of the retransmission consent negotiation rules, including the totality of the circumstances test which is used determine whether television stations and MVPDs are negotiating retransmission consent agreements in good faith. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 enacted in December 2019 made permanent the statutory requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith, which had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2019. 
 45

     Our Networks are subject to FCC sanctions or penalties if they violate the FCC's rules or regulations. 
         If we or any of our officers, directors, or attributable interest holders materially violate the FCC's rules and regulations or are convicted of a felony or are found to have engaged in unlawful anticompetitive conduct or fraud upon another government agency, the FCC may, in response to a petition by a third party or on its own initiative, in its discretion, commence a proceeding to impose sanctions upon us that could involve the imposition of monetary penalties, the denial of a license renewal application, revocation of a broadcast license or other sanctions. In addition, the FCC has recently emphasized more vigorous enforcement of certain of its regulations, including indecency standards, sponsorship identification requirements and children's programming requirements, which impact broadcasters, and also rules that relate to the emergency alert system and closed captioning, and equal employment opportunity outreach and recordkeeping requirements, which impact broadcasters and MVPDs. The FCC has also recently increased enforcement of requirements regarding online public inspection files, which are now maintained on an FCC website and are therefore widely accessible by members of the public and the FCC. In 2019, the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material increased from $407,270 to $414,454 per incident and the maximum forfeiture for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act increased to $3,825,726. In 2014, the FCC issued fines against three cable network owners, with the fines ranging from $280,000 to $1,120,000, for violating FCC rules relating to the emergency alert system. These enhanced enforcement efforts could result in increased costs associated with the adoption and implementation of stricter compliance procedures at our Business facilities or FCC fines. Additionally, the effect of recent judicial decisions regarding the FCC's indecency enforcement practices remain unclear and we are unable to predict the impact of these decisions on the FCC's enforcement practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our Business. 
   The cable, satellite and telco-delivered television industry is subject to substantial governmental regulation for which compliance may increase our Networks' costs, hinder our growth and possibly expose us to penalties for failure to comply. 
         The multichannel video programming distribution industry is subject to extensive legislation and regulation at the federal level, and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals. Operating in a regulated industry increases our cost of doing business as video programmers, and such regulation may also hinder our ability to increase and/or maintain our revenues. The regulation of programming services is subject to the political process and continues to be under evaluation and subject to change. Material changes in the law and regulatory requirements are difficult to anticipate and our Business may be harmed by future legislation, new regulation, deregulation and/or court decisions interpreting such laws and regulations. 
         The following are examples of the types of currently active legislative, regulatory and judicial inquiries and proceedings that may impact our Cable Networks. The FCC may adopt rules which would require cable and satellite providers to make available programming channels on an a la carte basis. A major component of our financial growth strategy is based on our ability to increase our Cable Networks' subscriber base. If our Cable Networks' programming services are required by the FCC to be offered on an "a la carte" basis, our Cable Networks could experience higher costs, reduced distribution of our program service, perhaps significantly, and loss of viewers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase our Cable Networks' subscriber base on cable, satellite and telco systems or that our current carriage will not decrease as a result of a number of factors or that we will be able to maintain or increase our Cable Networks' current subscriber fee rates. 
         Further, the FCC and certain courts are examining the types of technologies that will be considered "multichannel video programming systems" under federal regulation and the rules that will be applied to distribution of television programming via such technologies. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or proceedings or how their outcome would impact our ability to 
 46

   have our Cable Networks' content carried on multichannel programming distribution and the value of our advertising inventories. 
   Our Cable Networks are subject to Program Access restrictions. 
         Because certain of our directors are also directors of cable companies, we are considered to be a vertically integrated cable programmer and are subject to the program access rules. The other holdings of entities that acquire an interest in our capital stock may be attributable to our Cable Networks and could further subject us to the program access rule restrictions. While we do not believe our status as a vertically integrated cable programmer will materially limit or impair the activities of our Cable Networks, the program access rules could have a material adverse effect on our Business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   "Must-carry" regulations reduce the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of the Cable Networks cable offerings. 
         The Cable Act of 1992 imposed "must carry" or "retransmission consent" regulations on cable systems, requiring them to carry the signals of local broadcast television stations that choose to exercise their must carry rights rather than negotiate a retransmission consent arrangement. DBS systems are also subject to their own must carry rules. The FCC's implementation of these "must-carry" obligations requires cable and DBS operators to give certain broadcasters preferential access to channel space. This reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our Cable Networks offerings by cable television systems and DBS operators in the U.S. Congress, the FCC or any other foreign government may, in the future, adopt new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters which could affect our Cable Networks. 
   The broadcast incentive auction has resulted in the modification of our broadcast licenses for WAPA by requiring us to operate on other channels. 
         As a result of the FCC spectrum auction which was concluded in January 2017, the FCC is engaged in a "repack" of television stations that did not relinquish spectrum in the auction in remaining television broadcast spectrum, which requires certain television stations that did not relinquish spectrum to modify their transmission facilities, including requiring such stations to operate on other channel designations. The FCC is authorized to reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs. The original reimbursement limit across all stations was $1.75 billion. In March 2018 Congress authorized an additional $1 billion to be used for reimbursements related to repacking and directed that a portion of the additional funds be used to reimburse low power television stations, television translator stations and FM stations that are required to modify their facilities on a temporary or permanent basis to accommodate changes made by television stations being repacked as well as for consumer education efforts. The FCC, when repacking the television broadcast spectrum, will use reasonable efforts to preserve a station's coverage area and population served. The FCC has assigned new channels to stations that are required to be "repacked" and stations are in the process of moving to their new channels. We did not relinquish any of our spectrum in the auction. Two of our licenses, WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV, were reassigned new channels as a result of the incentive auction, have transitioned to new channels using interim facilities and we are in the process of completing the construction of permanent facilities for WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV on their post-auction channels. 
         We cannot predict whether following the repacking the coverage area and population served by our stations will be completely preserved or whether the $2.75 billion set aside for reimbursing repacking expenses will be sufficient to cover all repacking expenses. Nevertheless, we do not believe that the auction will have a material negative impact on our Business, because with post-auction channel assignments our stations will remain in the more desirable UHF band; our three television stations have overlapping coverage areas, so it is unlikely that we will lose service to a significant portion of the households that we serve. If the FCC is unable to reimburse all of our repacking expenses, the amount of the shortfall is unlikely to be material to our Business as a whole.

  Risks Related to Our Securities and Corporate Structure 
   If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our Business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline. 
         If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our Business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline. The trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about our Business, our market, or our competitors. As of December 31, 2019, only two industry analysts published research on our Business. If any of the analysts who may cover our Business change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover our Business were to cease coverage of Hemisphere or fail to regularly publish reports about us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. 
   The stock price of our Class A common stock may be volatile. 
         The stock price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our Class A common stock include:
 

 market and economic conditions, including market conditions in the cable television programming and broadcasting industries; 
 actual or expected variations in quarterly operating results; 
 liquidity of our Class A common stock; 
 differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; 
 changes in recommendations by securities analysts; 
 operations and stock performance of our competitors; 
 accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill; 
 significant acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by our competitors; 
 sales of our Class A common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors; 
 recruitment or departure of key personnel; 
 loss of key advertisers; and 
 changes in reserves for professional liability claims. 

         We cannot assure you that the price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance. 
 48

     The market liquidity for our Class A common stock is relatively low and may make it difficult to purchase or sell our Class A common stock. 
         The average daily trading volume in our Class A common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 29,202 shares. Although a more active trading market may develop in the future, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop for our Class A common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell our Class A common stock and the limited market liquidity for our securities could affect a holder's ability to sell at a price satisfactory to that holder. 
   We are a "controlled company" within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, we qualify for, and choose to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. 
         Our controlling stockholder, Gato Investments LP, controls the majority of the voting power of all of our outstanding capital stock. As a result of the concentration of the voting rights in our Company, we are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the rules and corporate governance standards of NASDAQ. Under the NASDAQ rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a "controlled company" and may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including:
 

 the requirement that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors; 
 the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; 
 the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and 
 the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees. 

         We have elected not to comply with the above corporate governance requirements. Accordingly, our stockholders are not afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other NASDAQ-listed companies for so long as we remain a "controlled company" and rely upon such exemptions. The interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders, and the concentration of voting power in such stockholder will limit our other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters. 
   Our controlling stockholder exercises significant influence over us and their interests in our Business may be different from the interests of our stockholders; future sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock may adversely affect our market price. 
         Our controlling stockholder, Gato Investments LP, controls the majority of the voting power of all of our outstanding capital stock. The controlling stockholders' Class B common stock vote on a 10 to 1 basis with our Class A common stock, which means that each share of our Class B common stock has 10 votes and each share of our Class A common stock has 1 vote. All shares of our capital stock vote together as a single class. Accordingly, our controlling stockholder generally has the ability for the foreseeable future to influence the outcome of any of our corporate actions which require stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, the election of directors, significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of the Company or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated voting control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common. 
         Our controlling stockholder may delay or prevent a change in control in our Business. In addition, the significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the value of our Class A common 
 49

   stock due to a resulting lack of liquidity of our Class A common stock or a perception among investors that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. If our controlling stockholder sells a substantial amount of our Class A common stock (upon conversion of their Class B common stock, which may be converted at any time in their sole discretion) in the public market, or investors perceive that these sales could occur, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected. 
         The interests of our controlling stockholder, which has investments in other companies, may from time to time diverge from the interests of our other stockholders, particularly with regard to new investment opportunities. Our controlling stockholder is not restricted from investing in other businesses involving or related to programming, content, production and broadcasting. Our controlling stockholder may also engage in other businesses that compete or may in the future compete with our Business. 
         We have entered into a Registration Rights Agreement and joinders thereto with certain parties, including our controlling stockholder. If requested properly under the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, certain of these stockholders have the right to require us to register the offer and sale of all or some of their Class A common stock (including upon conversion of their Class B common stock) under the Securities Act in certain circumstances and also have the right to include those shares in a registration initiated by us. If we are required to include the shares of capital stock held by these stockholders pursuant to these registration rights in a registration initiated by us, sales made by such stockholders may adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock and our ability to raise needed capital. In addition, if these stockholders exercise their demand registration rights and cause a large number of shares to be sold in the public market or demand that we include their shares for registration on a shelf registration statement, such sales or shelf registration may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. 
         Any other future sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock into the public market, or perceptions in the market that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. 
   We have a staggered board of directors and other anti-takeover provisions, which may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of our stockholders. 
         Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, at any annual meeting only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election. Since this "staggered board" would prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our board of directors at any annual meeting, it may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Some of the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could, together or separately, discourage potential acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control. In particular, our board of directors is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with rights and privileges that might be senior to either class of our common stock and, without the consent of the holders of either class of our common stock. 
   Our dependence on subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our Business. 
         We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. We conduct, and expect to continue conducting, all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us. 
 50

   Although our Second Amended Term Loan Facility permits certain restricted payments from our subsidiaries to us to pay for our administrative expenses corporate overhead, franchise taxes, public company costs, directors' fees and certain insurance premiums and deductibles, it restricts our subsidiaries ability to remit dividends to us in other instances at certain leverage ratios. Additionally, dividends to us from WAPA are also subject to certain local taxation. Consequently, our ability to pay dividends is limited by funds that our subsidiaries are permitted to dividend to us, and in certain instances, will subject us to certain tax liabilities. 
   General Risk Factors 
   Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could negatively impact our results of operations. 
         Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in parts of the United States or in one or more of the major markets in which we operate, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to loss of subscriptions for our Networks. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
         The risks associated with our advertising revenue become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, including, as a result of public health crises, such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Cancellations, reductions or delays in purchases of advertising could, and often do, occur as a result of a strike, a general economic downturn, an economic downturn in one or more industries or in one or more geographic areas, or a failure to agree on contractual terms. 
   Any potential hostilities, terrorist attacks, or similarly newsworthy events leading to broadcast interruptions, may affect our revenues and results of operations. 
         If any existing hostilities escalate, or if the United States experiences a terrorist attack or experiences any similar event resulting in interruptions to regularly scheduled broadcasting, we may lose revenue and/or incur increased expenses. Lost revenue and increased expenses may be due to preemption, delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns, or diminished subscriber fees, as well as increased costs of covering such events. We cannot predict the (i) extent or duration of any future disruption to our programming schedule, (ii) amount of advertising revenue that would be lost or delayed, (iii) the amount of decline in any subscriber fees or (iv) the amount by which broadcasting expenses would increase as a result. Any such loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations. 
   We may need to increase the size of our organization, and may experience difficulties in managing growth. 
         At Hemisphere, the parent holding company, we do not have significant operating assets and only have a limited number of employees. In connection with the completion of any future acquisitions, we may be required to hire additional personnel and enhance our information technology systems. Any future growth may increase our corporate operating costs and impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees and implement enhanced informational technology systems. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. Future growth will also increase our costs and expenses and limit our liquidity.

     Future acquisitions or business opportunities, including investments in complementary businesses could involve unknown risks that could harm our Business and adversely affect our financial condition. 
         From time to time, we have acquired or invested in complementary businesses and entered into joint ventures/investments. In the future we may make other acquisitions, invest in complementary businesses including joint ventures that involve unknown risks, and may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our Business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such transactions involve numerous other risks including:
 

 difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business; 
 difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses; 
 inability to obtain required regulatory approvals on favorable terms; 
 potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships or key customers of either acquired businesses or our business; 
 assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired businesses; 
 dilution of interests of holders of our common shares through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities; and 
 in the case of joint ventures and other investments, interests that diverge from those of our partners without the ability to direct the
management and operations of the joint venture or investment in the manner we believe most appropriate. 

         Although we intend to conduct extensive business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of future business or acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. We may be unable to adequately address the financial, legal and operational risks raised by such businesses, acquisitions or joint ventures. The realization of any unknown risks could expose us to unanticipated costs and liabilities and prevent or limit us from realizing the projected benefits of the businesses or acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, our Business, financial condition, results of operations and the ability to service our debt may be adversely impacted depending on specific risks applicable to any business or company we acquire. 
   We could consume resources in researching acquisitions, business opportunities or financings and capital market transactions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or invest in another business. 
         We anticipate that the investigation of each specific acquisition or business opportunity and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments, with respect to such transaction, will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for financial advisors, accountants, attorneys and other advisors. If a decision is made not to consummate a specific acquisition, business opportunities or financings and capital market transactions investment or financing, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific acquisition, investment target or financing, we may fail to consummate the investment or acquisition for any number of reasons, including those beyond our control. Any such event could consume significant management time and result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred, which could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to consummate other acquisitions and investments.

     Possible strategic initiatives may impact our Business. 
         We will continue to evaluate the nature and scope of our operations and various short-term and long-term strategic considerations. There are uncertainties and risks relating to strategic initiatives. Also, prospective competitors may have greater financial resources. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully completing future acquisitions and investments. Future acquisitions or joint ventures may not be available on attractive terms, or at all. If we do make additional acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses. For example, we could face several challenges in the consolidation and integration of information technology, accounting systems, personnel and operations. In addition, while we believe that there may be target businesses that we could potentially acquire or invest in, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. We may need to obtain additional financing in order to consummate future acquisitions and investment opportunities. We cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. This inherent competitive limitation gives others with greater financial resources an advantage in pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities. Finally, certain acquisitions or divestitures may be subject to FCC approval and FCC rules and regulations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, there may be an adverse effect on our Business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   In the course of their other business activities, certain of our officers and directors may become aware of investment and acquisition opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Such officers and directors may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. 
         Certain of our officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are or may be affiliated. Due to those officers' and directors' existing affiliations with other entities, they may have fiduciary obligations to present potential business opportunities to those entities in addition to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. To the extent that such officers and directors identify business combination opportunities that may be suitable for entities to which they have pre-existing fiduciary obligations, or are presented with such opportunities in their capacities as fiduciaries to such entities, they may be required to honor their pre-existing fiduciary obligations to such entities. Accordingly, they may not present business combination opportunities to us that otherwise may be attractive to such entities unless the other entities have declined to accept such opportunities. 
   We have incurred substantial costs in connection with our previous acquisitions, joint ventures and growth strategy, including legal, accounting, advisory and other costs. 
         We have incurred substantial costs, including a number of non-recurring costs, in connection with our prior acquisitions, joint ventures and growth strategy and expect to incur substantial costs in connection with any other transaction we complete in the future. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the acquisition is completed. These costs will reduce the amount of cash otherwise available to us for acquisitions, business opportunities and other corporate purposes. There is no assurance that the actual costs will not exceed our estimates. We may continue to incur additional material charges reflecting additional costs associated with our investments and the integration of our acquisitions, and joint ventures in fiscal quarters subsequent to the quarter in which the relevant acquisition was consummated. 
 53

     From time to time we may be subject to litigation for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which, if adversely determined, may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
         We and our subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary or routine litigation incidental to our or their current or prior businesses or not material to our consolidated financial position or liquidity. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any litigation in which we or our subsidiaries may become involved, or that our or their insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any potential losses. To the extent that we or our subsidiaries sustain losses from any pending litigation which are not reserved or otherwise provided for or insured against, our Business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
   Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar laws and regulations could have a negative impact on us. 
         We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing business cross-border and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. companies and their subsidiaries from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. Internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such policies and the law. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing their international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. 
   Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and to report on our assessment as to the effectiveness of these controls. Any delays or difficulty in satisfying these requirements or negative reports concerning our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 
         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. The need to focus on compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley may strain management and finance resources and otherwise present additional administrative and operational challenges as our management seeks to comply with these requirements. 
         We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement, particularly with respect to our existing acquired businesses, businesses that we may acquire in the future and newly 
 54

   formed businesses or entities. We cannot be certain that any remedial measures we take will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate internal controls over our financial reporting processes and reporting in the future. 
         In addition, we may acquire an entity that was not previously subject to U.S. public company requirements or did not previously prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP or is not in compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other public company reporting obligations applicable to such entity. We may incur additional costs in order to ensure that after such acquisition, we continue to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and our other public company requirements, which in turn could reduce our earnings or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, development of an adequate financial reporting system and the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. To the extent any of these newly acquired entities or any existing entities have deficiencies in its internal controls, it may impact our internal controls. 
         Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we fail to remedy any material weakness and maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting in the future, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting to the extent required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our financial statements may be inaccurate, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, the trading price of our Class A common stock may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or NASDAQ. In addition, failure to comply with our reporting obligations with the Commission may cause an event of default to occur under our Second Amended Term Loan Facility, or similar instruments governing any debt we incur in the future. 
   Changes in governmental regulation, interpretation or legislative reform could increase our Business's cost of doing business and adversely affect our profitability. 
         Laws and regulations, including in the areas of advertising, consumer affairs, data protection, finance, marketing, privacy, publishing and taxation requirements, are subject to change and differing interpretations. Changes in the political climate or in existing laws or regulations, or their interpretations, or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations or changes in enforcement priorities or activity could adversely affect us by, among other things:
 

 increasing our administrative, compliance, and other costs; 
 forcing us to undergo a corporate restructuring; 
 limiting our ability to engage in inter-company transactions with our affiliates and subsidiaries; 
 increasing our tax obligations, including unfavorable outcomes from audits performed by various tax authorities; 
 affecting our ability to continue to serve our Networks' customers and to attract new customers; 
 affecting cash management practices and repatriation efforts; 
 forcing us to alter or restructure our Networks' relationships with vendors and contractors; 
 increasing compliance efforts or costs; 

 55

   

 limiting our use of or access to personal information; 
 restricting our ability to market our products; and 
 requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems. 

         For example, the newly-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 could adversely impact our results of operations. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax balances requires judgment and estimation. Our provision for income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. 
         Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for consumers, including more ability to control how their data is shared with third parties. Furthermore, some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, and other states are beginning to pass similar laws. Compliance with such regulations is costly and time-consuming, and we may encounter difficulties, delays or significant expenses in connection with such compliance, and we may be exposed to significant penalties, liabilities, reputational harm and loss of business in the event that we fail to comply. While it is not possible to predict when or whether fundamental policy or interpretive changes would occur, these or other changes could fundamentally change the dynamics of the industries in which we operate or the costs associated with our operations. Changes in public policy or enforcement priorities could materially affect our profitability, our ability to retain or grow business, or in the event of extreme circumstances, our financial condition. There can be no assurance that legislative or regulatory change or interpretive differences will not have a material adverse effect on our Business.
