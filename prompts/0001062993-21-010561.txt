The last 1.8 miles to the property is by trail road using 4x4 vehicle. The property is covered with extensive outcroppings of the Esmeralda Formation. Power transmission line is within ½ mile of the northern property boundary. Water would have to be trucked in or by pipe line if a processing facility was built onsite. Of particular interest is a section of green, volcanoclastic, evaporate-rich mudstone strata known as the Frontera Verde zone that host lithium of potential economic significance. The Frontera Verde Zone is exposed over approximately 100 acres of the northern two thirds of the property, and underlies the rest of the property at shallow depths. Third party drilling adjacent to the west and eastern boundaries of the property supports this analysis. The property is without known reserves and the current work programs are exploratory in nature. 
 During the year ended August 31, 2019, the Company received an Area of Disturbance permit from the Bureau of Land Management, Nevada, allowing the Company access for a series of diamond drill holes. The diamond drill program was completed in December 2018 and consisted of 5 diamond drill holes totaling approximately 2,000 feet. Four drill holes were for resource definition drilling to allow the Company to provide an inaugural 43-101 project wide lithium resource. A fifth diamond drill hole drilled to an estimated depth of approximately 265 feet with the recovered lithium enriched material being used for metallurgical and pH solution testing.
 During the year ended August 31,2020, the Company released its inaugural 43-101 Resource on April 2, 2020 this report can be viewed at sedar.ca and at the company's website enertopia.com.
 The Company continues with solutions testing, running pre-strip reagent testing to control impurity levels in the Upper Oxide and Reduced drilled horizons, to determine how various pH levels with different reagents impact the impurities in each claystone zone. This will allow the Company to see if pre-stripping the impurities prior to making its synthetic brine is a viable option. This appears to be the case as the potential loss of lithium was below the detection limits in all pre-stripping tests, as described below. The Company continues to evaluate off the shelf technology to determine the preferred methods for potentially producing commercial products from the processing of synthetic brines.
 The latest solutions testing was focused on the upper oxide zone. The sample size of each test was 20g solids with the ratio being 10% solids in the solution. Due to the success in lowering impurities, we believe we should be able to increase the solids ratio, thus increasing the lithium in the solution going forward using standard off the shelf technology.
 Table 1 below showcases the low levels of impurities achieved in one of our completed pre-stripping process tests compared to one currently producing Li brine project and one Li brine project currently being evaluated. Reduction of impurities in synthetic brine produced for processing is an essential element of cost reduction.

 In connection with the Area of Disturbance permit the company posted a bond of $6,520 to insure completion of future restoration obligations. The bond was released to the Company on September 27, 2019 and a refund of $6,476.82 was received by the Company.

LITHIUM TECHNOLOGY
 As noted above, the Company continues to test and concentrate on using off-the-shelf technology under the potential low capex scenarios.
 PROVISIONAL PATENTS
 On May 25, 2021 the Company announced the filing of provisional patent #1, known as the Enertopia Solar Booster TM. The Enertopia Solar Booster captures heat from the solar panels, increasing PV output enhancing production and increasing the lifetime of the PV panels.

On May 26, 2021 the Company announced the filing of provisional patent #2, known as Enertopia Heat ExtractorTM Heat Extractor Technology can be used behind the PV panels or in a glazed format on their own to create liquid temperatures in excess of 200 degrees F.
 On August 17, 2021 the Company announced the filing of provisional patent #3, known as Enertopia RainmakerTM By cooling the backside of the PV panels below the dew point the atmospheric moisture condenses on the back side of the panel and drips as rain into the tray collecting the water.
 Summary
 The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful program of development, and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
 There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. There is significant uncertainty as to whether we can obtain additional financing.
 Employees
 We primarily used the services of sub-contractors and consultants for our intended business operations. Our technical consultant is Mr. McAllister, our president and a director.
 We entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Robert McAllister on December 1, 2007. During the term of this agreement, Mr. McAllister is to provide corporate administration and consulting services, such duties and responsibilities to include provision of oil and gas industry consulting services, strategic corporate and financial planning, management of the overall business operations of the Company, and supervising office staff and exploration and oil & gas consultants. Mr. McAllister's consulting fees amounts to $3,500 plus GST per month. On July 31, 2017 Mr. McAllister agreed to be interim CFO until such time as a replacement could be sourced. Mr. McAllister voluntarily suspended and terminated accrual of these consulting fees commencing on December 1, 2019 and continuing until such time as the Company's financial condition permits a resumption of such cost.
 We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next 12 month period. We do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed.
 Research and Development
 We have incurred $14,268 in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.
