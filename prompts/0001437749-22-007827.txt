Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 
Aravive, Inc. was incorporated on December 10, 2008 in the State of Delaware. Aravive Biologics, Inc. (“Aravive Biologics”) our wholly owned subsidiary was incorporated in 2007. Aravive is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments designed to halt the progression of life-threatening diseases, including cancer and fibrosis.
 
Our lead product candidate, batiraxcept (formerly AVB-500), is an ultrahigh-affinity, decoy protein that targets the GAS6-AXL signaling pathway. By capturing serum GAS6, batiraxcept starves the AXL pathway of its signal, potentially halting the biological programming that promotes disease progression. AXL receptor signaling plays an important role in multiple types of malignancies by promoting metastasis, cancer cell survival, resistance to treatments, and immune suppression.
 
Our current development program benefits from the availability of a proprietary serum-based biomarker that accelerated batiraxcept drug development by allowing us to select a pharmacologically active dose and may potentially identify the cancer patients that have the best chance of responding to batiraxcept.
 
In July 2016, Aravive Biologics was approved for a $20.0 million Product Development Award from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (“CPRIT Grant”). The CPRIT Grant was expected to allow Aravive Biologics to develop the product candidate referenced above through clinical trials. The CPRIT Grant was effective as of June 1, 2016 and terminated on November 30, 2019. Aravive Biologics’ royalty and other obligations, including its obligation to repay the disbursed grant proceeds under certain circumstances, survive the termination of the agreement. The CPRIT Grant was subject to customary CPRIT funding conditions including a matching funds requirement where Aravive Biologics matched 50% of funding from the CPRIT Grant. Consequently, Aravive Biologics was required to raise $10.0 million in matching funds over the three-year project. Aravive Biologics raised all its required $10.0 million in matching funds.
 
Aravive Biologics’ award from CPRIT requires it to pay CPRIT a portion of its revenues from sales of certain products, or received from its licensees or sublicensees, at tiered percentages of revenue in the low- to mid-single digits until the aggregate amount of such payments equals 400% of the grant award proceeds, and thereafter at a rate of less than one percent for as long as Aravive Biologics maintains government exclusivity. In addition, the grant contract also contains a provision that provides for repayment to CPRIT of the full amount of the grant proceeds under certain specified circumstances involving relocation of Aravive Biologics’ principal place of business outside Texas.
 
In our completed Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers with batiraxcept, we demonstrated proof of mechanism for batiraxcept in neutralizing GAS6. Importantly, batiraxcept had a favorable safety profile preclinically and in the first in human trial and Phase 1b clinical trial in cancer patients.
 
In August 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) designated as a Fast Track development program the investigation of batiraxcept for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer ("PROC").
 
In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial of batiraxcept combined with standard of care therapies in patients with PROC for which it reported results in July 2020.
 
In April 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited (“WuXi”), the objective of which is to identify and develop novel high-affinity bispecific antibodies against CCN2, also known as connective tissue growth factor ("CTGF"), implicated in cancer and fibrosis, and identified from a similar target discovery screen that identified the significance of the AXL/GAS6 pathway in cancer. The goal is to generate a best-in-class therapeutic targeting desmoplasia and tumor growth for initial investigation in the clinic in 2023.
 
In November 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with 3D Medicines Inc. ("3D Medicines") (the “Agreement” or the “3D Medicine Agreement”), whereby the Company granted 3D Medicines an exclusive license to develop and commercialize products that contain batiraxcept as the sole drug substance for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of human oncological diseases, in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (the "Territory") for an upfront cash payment of $12 million. During the second quarter of 2021, we received a $6 million development milestone from 3D Medicines, for completing our first clinical milestone with 3D Medicines, dosing the first patient in our Phase 3 trial of batiraxcept in PROC. Based upon this event, we received a $6 million cash payment during the second quarter of 2021. In August 2021, we received a $3 million development milestone from 3D Medicines, based on the Center for Drug Evaluation ("CDE") of the China National Medical Products Administration ("NMPA") approval of the Investigational New Drug application ("IND") submitted by 3D Medicines to participate in our international batiraxcept Phase 3 PROC clinical trial.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we initiated the Phase 1b portion of our Phase 1b/2 trial of batiraxcept in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (“ccRCC”) and we dosed our first patient in the trial in March 2021.
 
During the first quarter of 2021, we initiated a registrational Phase 3 trial of batiraxcept in PROC and we dosed our first patient in the trial in April 2021.
 
In May 2021, we initiated the Phase 1b portion of our Phase 1b/2 trial of batiraxcept in first-line pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and we dosed our first patient in the trial in August 2021.
 
In June 2021, we announced positive initial safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic results from the Phase 1b portion of the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in ccRCC in 3 patients dosed with 15mg/kg of batiraxcept. Based on the pharmacokinetics (“PK”), pharmacodynamics, and safety data at 15mg/kg of batiraxcept, and approval by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board ("DSMB"), we announced plans to expand the dosing of 15mg/kg of batiraxcept to additional patients to determine the potential of initiating the Phase 2 portion with this dose. We also announced plans to continue to investigate higher doses of batiraxcept in the Phase 1b to obtain additional safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics information.
 
In October 2021, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) granted orphan drug designation for batiraxcept for the treatment of ovarian cancer, following a recommendation from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.
 
In November 2021, we announced positive preliminary safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data for 18 patients and clinical activity data for 16 evaluable patients from the Phase 1b trial evaluating batiraxcept in combination with cabozantinib for treatment of ccRCC.
 
In January 2022, we provided updated safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data encompassing a total of 26 patients and updated clinical activity data encompassing a total of 23 patients from the Phase 1b trial evaluating batiraxcept in combination with cabozantinib for treatment of ccRCC.  We also provided clinical activity data for 6 patients in a trial evaluating batiraxcept in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma eligible to receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatment.
 
In March 2022, we announced updated safety and clinical activity data from the 26 patients from the Phase 1b trial evaluating batiraxcept in combination with cabozantinib for treatment of ccRCC.  We also provided updated clinical activity for 13 patients in a trial evaluating batiraxcept in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) in first-line pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. Additionally, we announced that the interim analysis from the P3 PROC trial had been eliminated as we had confidence that the study would enroll the required number of bevacizumab naïve patients to balance the bevacizumab populations without an interim analysis. We are in the process of communicating with the FDA regarding changes to the analysis plan.
 
 As we advance our clinical programs, we are in close contact with our clinical research organizations ("CROs") and clinical sites and are continually assessing the impact of COVID-19 on our planned trials and current timelines and costs. We have experienced delays in patient enrollment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time or increases in severity, the Company could experience significant disruptions to its clinical development timelines and, if we experience delays in patient enrollment and deems it necessary or advisable to improve patient recruitment by, among other things, opening additional clinical sites, we could incur increased clinical program expenses. Any such disruptions or delays would, and any such increased clinical program expenses could, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

First Oncology Indication - Ovarian Cancer and Current Market Opportunity
 
The decision to select high grade platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer as our first indication was based upon the preclinical data that we generated with batiraxcept in PROC, the fact that high grade serous ovarian cancer tumors are highly AXL positive and the high unmet medical need for effective therapies to treat PROC. In August 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to batiraxcept for PROC.
 
Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women in the U.S., accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.  According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that in 2022 there will be approximately 19,880 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in the United States and approximately 12,810 ovarian cancer deaths in the United States. A woman’s risk of getting ovarian cancer during her lifetime is about 1 in 78. Her lifetime chance of dying from ovarian cancer is about 1 in 108.  Due to the nonspecific nature of disease symptoms, currently approximately 70% of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, at which point their prognosis is poor. Improving the ability to detect ovarian cancer early is a research priority, given that women diagnosed with localized-stage disease have more than a 90% five-year survival rate.
 
Decision Resources Group, LLC or DRG in its January 2021 Key Findings in Ovarian Cancer, Disease Landscape and Forecast Report estimates the total ovarian cancer market to grow in the major markets (United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan) at an annual rate of 12.5% from nearly $3 billion in 2019 to nearly $10 billion in 2029.
 
Treatment of PROC patients (patients whose disease progresses within 6 months of their last platinum-based therapy) on their second- and third-line of therapy consists of a nonplatinum monotherapy as sequential single-agent salvage chemotherapy has been shown to be superior to multiagent chemotherapy in this setting (DRG- December 2019 Ovarian Cancer Disease Landscape and Forecast). Widely used single-agent therapies in this population include gemcitabine, pegylated-liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, and paclitaxel (“PAC”) with or without bevacizumab or Avastin. The median progression free survival (“PFS”) rate for patients given standard of care (PAC or doxil/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (“PLD”)) to treat platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer is 3-4 months, with a median overall survival (“OS”) of 9-12 months (A. Davis et al. / Gynecologic Oncology 133 (2014) 624–631).  Adding bevacizumab to the chemotherapy resulted in a median PFS of 6.7 months (Pujade-Lauraine, et al., J Clin Oncol 32:1302-1308) but there was no OS benefit (Stockler MR, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2014 May 1;32(13):1309-16). In the United States, another treatment option in third-line platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer are poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) which are indicated as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) with advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. There is no standard of care for patients with non-BRCA mutated/ HR proficient ovarian cancer in the fourth- and subsequent-line settings. The majority of these patients have become platinum-resistant and are typically managed with monotherapy chemotherapy treatments.

Overview of Our Phase 1b Clinical Trial for the Treatment of Patients with PROC
 
In December 2018, following a normal healthy volunteer trial that identified a dose of 10mg/kg batiraxcept as sufficient to suppress serum GAS6 levels for a two-week period, we began treating patients in our Phase 1b clinical trial combining 10mg/kg (administered every 2 weeks) batiraxcept with standard-of-care therapies (specifically, PAC or PLD) in patients with PROC.
 
The Phase 1b clinical trial was designed, in part, to confirm the dosing regimen predicated on the Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers and to identify the dose to investigate in later stage trials. The primary objective of the Phase 1b clinical trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of batiraxcept in combination with PAC or PLD, and secondary objectives were to assess PK and pharmacodynamics (serum GAS6 and soluble AXL (“sAXL”) levels), efficacy, and potential immunogenicity of batiraxcept. Exploratory objectives included efficacy endpoints in biomarker (GAS6, AXL) defined populations based on expression of those biomarkers in serum and/or tumor tissue.
 
In September 2019, we presented positive data from the initial 12 patients of the Phase 1b clinical trial in a late breaking oral presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Barcelona and based upon our analysis of the data decided to study higher doses of the drug and expanded the Phase 1b trial to study 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose levels.
 
Data from the Phase 1a and 1b Clinical Trials of batiraxcept 
 
The safety of batiraxcept was studied in 84 subjects, including 31 healthy volunteers in a Phase 1a clinical trial and 53 PROC patients in a Phase 1b clinical trial (40 in 10 mg/kg cohort, 6 in 15 mg/kg cohort, and 7 in 20 mg/kg cohort). The primary objective of the Phase 1b clinical trial was to assess safety of batiraxcept in combination with PAC or PLD. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (“ORR”), CA-125 response, clinical benefit rate, PFS, OS, PK profile, GAS6 serum levels, and anti-drug antibody titers.
 
Safety Data: Analysis of all safety data to date demonstrates that batiraxcept has been generally well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities or unexpected safety signals. There were no batiraxcept-related significant adverse events reported. There were two types of adverse events that were considered related to batiraxcept, as determined by an independent medical monitor: infusion reactions and fatigue.  A premedication regimen was designed and implemented during the trial to manage potential infusion reactions.
Pharmacokinetics: Prior data analysis of 31 patients from the 10 mg/kg cohort showed that blood trough levels of batiraxcept demonstrated statistically significant correlation with clinical activity, as patients who achieved minimal efficacious concentration (MEC) >13.8 mg/L demonstrated a greater likelihood of response and prolonged PFS. Updated modeling using actual data from all enrolled patients demonstrated that the 20 mg/kg dose is not predicted to improve PFS relative to the 15 mg/kg dose so the dose of 15 mg/kg was selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose or RP2D for batiraxcept.
Clinical Activity: While the Phase 1b clinical trial was a safety trial and not powered to demonstrate efficacy, the investigator-assessed best response or RECIST V1.1 to batiraxcept across all cohorts supports promising clinical activity.  The Phase 1b study data is summarized as follows:

• | All doses of batiraxcept (10, 15 and 20mg/kg) were well-tolerated and the safety profile of the combination with PAC or PLD was consistent with the safety profile of PAC or PLD alone. Infusion reactions were noted, likely related to batiraxcept infusion and they were managed by a premedication regimen.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Batiraxcept plus PAC appeared to perform better than batiraxcept plus PLD: across all cohorts, batiraxcept plus PAC data show an ORR of 35% (8/23, including 2 CRs) compared to ORR of 11% (3/28) in batiraxcept plus PLD.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | While not powered to demonstrate efficacy, drug exposure levels correlated with clinical response as there was a statistically significant relationship between batiraxcept trough levels and PFS, supporting the use of higher dose than 10 mg/kg of batiraxcept. Additionally, batiraxcept combined with PAC had better clinical responses in patients whose trough levels were above the MEC of 13.8 mg/L compared to those patients whose trough levels were below the MEC. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Batiraxcept demonstrated meaningful benefit in patients with later lines of therapy and showed improved clinical benefit over published data showing response for patients who were on their third and fourth lines of therapy (Bruchim et al, European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology 166 (2013) 94–98) or who progressed in less than 3 months following their last platinum-containing regimen (Kobayashi-Kato et al., Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology (2019) 84:33-39 37).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Batiraxcept plus chemo appeared to perform better in patients without previous exposure to bevacizumab.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In a subgroup analysis of patients who had not been previously exposed to bevacizumab in their prior lines of therapy, batiraxcept plus chemotherapy yielded an ORR of 60% (6/10 including 2 CR) when combined with PAC and an ORR of 19% (3/16) when combined with PLD. For reference, control arms of the third-party AURELIA trial of bevacizumab (NCT00976911) showed ORR of 30.2% (out of 55 patients total) with PAC alone and 7.8% (out of 64 patients total) with PLD alone.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Patients who received 10 or 15 mg/kg in combination with PAC and whose trough level was above the MEC of 13.8mg/L demonstrated clinical activity (67% response rate, 7.7 months PFS, and 19.3 months OS) greater than what was reported for PAC alone (bevacizumab naïve) patients in the AURELIA trial: 30.2% ORR (no CR reported); 3.9 months mPFS; and 13.2 months mOS (Poveda et al, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 33, No 32 (November 10), 2015: pp 3836-3838). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Serum levels of sAXL/GAS6 ratio related to response to batiraxcept and may identify PROC patients more likely to respond to batiraxcept chemotherapy combinations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the entire Phase 1b cohort, patients with a high sAXL/GAS6 ratio had 33% ORR (11/33) versus 0% ORR (0/15) in patients with a low sAXL/GAS6 ratio.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | This biomarker will be investigated in every clinical trial, including the P3 PROC trial, to see if it can be validated for use to enrich the patient population likely to respond.

• | Batiraxcept treatment alone demonstrated an ability to maintain tumor response. Three patients during the P1b clinical trial maintained their response for 3-6 months following discontinuation of chemotherapy and while remaining on batiraxcept treatment alone. The tumor in one patient in the 15mg/kg group had completely responded (CR) and tumors in the other 2 patients in the 10 mg/kg group had PR while remaining on batiraxcept treatment alone.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Two patients whose responses (CR and PR) were maintained on batiraxcept treatment alone for at least 6 months following discontinuation of chemotherapy missed their next dose of batiraxcept (one because she was hospitalized with COVID and one because she wanted to take a vacation) and their tumors showed progression at the next visit. These data suggest the responses these patients experienced was likely attributable to batiraxcept treatment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 3 Registrational Trial Design in PROC 
 
On November 19, 2020, we announced that we had received guidance from the FDA on a registrational Phase 3 trial design for batiraxcept in PROC. The FDA feedback received was that this trial, if successful, could support full approval of batiraxcept for the treatment of PROC. No further preclinical or clinical pharmacology studies are required at this time. The global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled is designed to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of batiraxcept at a dose of 15 mg/kg in combination with PAC.  The initial trial was an adaptive designed trial which included an interim analysis that would allow an additional 100 bevacizumab naïve patients to be enrolled to balance the bevacizumab populations should the interim analysis suggest additional bevacizumab naïve patients are potentially needed to increase the chance for success at the end of the trial.  The pivotal, adaptive Phase 3 trial was expected to enroll approximately 300-400 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer who have received one to four prior lines of therapy. In March 2022, we announced that we are seeking to omit the interim analysis in the trial as we believe we can enroll the number of bevacizumab naïve patients needed to have a potentially successful study. We are in the process of communicating with the FDA regarding proposed changes to the trial’s statistical analysis plan. This global trial is planned to be conducted at approximately 165 sites in the U.S., Canada, China, and Europe. The primary endpoint for the trial is PFS, and secondary endpoints include OS, ORR based on RECIST 1.1, safety and tolerability, DoR, quality of life, clinical benefit rate, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. Exploratory biomarkers include serum GAS6, serum sAXL and batiraxcept drug levels. We dosed our first patient in the trial in April 2021.

Second Oncology Indication-ccRCC
 
ccRCC and Current Market Opportunity
 
The decision to select ccRCC as our second indication was based upon the strong preclinical data that we generated with batiraxcept and the fact that AXL expression in primary tumors of ccRCC patients has been shown in third party studies as well as our own studies (Rankin et al, PNAS September 16, 2014 vol. 111 no. 37 13373–13378), to correlate with aggressive tumor behaviors.
 
Kidney cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and is among the 10 most common cancers in both men and women. Metastasis to distant organs including the lung, bone, liver and brain is the primary cause of death in kidney cancer patients as only 12% of metastatic kidney cancer will survive past 5 years. According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that there will be approximately 79,000 new cases of kidney cancer and 13,920 people will die from this disease in the United States during 2022.
 
ccRCC is a cancer of the kidney. The name "clear cell" refers to the appearance of the cancer cells when viewed with a microscope. ccRCC occurs when cells in the kidney quickly increase in number, creating a lump (mass). Though the exact cause of ccRCC is unknown, smoking, excessive use of certain medications, and genetic predisposition conditions, e.g., von Hippel Lindau syndrome which involves genetic mutation in VHL, a tumor suppressor gene controlling tumor initiation in ∼90% of ccRCC tumors, may contribute to the development of this type of cancer.
 
Treatment often begins with surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible, and may be followed by radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, or targeted therapy. Most kidney cancer is chemotherapy and radiation resistant, resulting in a large unmet need for treatment options. As reported in Decision Resources Group, LLC’s December 2019 Report on The Landscape & Forecast of Renal Cell Carcinoma, nivolumab and cabozantinib have experienced strong uptake as second-line therapies since their FDA approvals (in 2015 and 2016, respectively). However, DRG anticipates that nivolumab’s second-line patient shares, across the major markets, will begin to decline from 29-35% in 2018 to 22-27% in 2028, in part owing to its first-line label expansion in combination with ipilimumab and then later as other combination regimens with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors enter the first-line setting. In contrast, cabozantinib’s second-line patient share as monotherapy is expected to steadily increase over the forecast period as its use in the first-line setting correspondingly declines, and it solidifies its position as the treatment of choice following a first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor combination. By 2023, it is estimated by DRG that cabozantinib will overtake nivolumab as the second-line sales and patient-share leader in all major markets; in 2028, it is expected to earn patient shares of 31-43% across the major markets. Similarly, DRG expects axitinib’s second-line patient share will decline over the forecast period, corresponding to the uptake of cabozantinib and the notable uptake of pembrolizumab plus axitinib in the first-line setting; its major-market patient shares will then stabilize to 6-16% between 2024 and 2028. These assumptions in renal cell carcinoma suggest the greatest need may be with respect to second line therapies and in combination with cabozantanib.

Planned Phase 1b/ 2 Clinical Trial
 
In February 2019, we announced our plans to develop batiraxcept in our second oncology indication, ccRCC. On January 13, 2020, we announced that we had received FDA clearance of our IND for investigation of our lead candidate, batiraxcept, in the treatment of ccRCC.
Figure 3: Phase 1b/2 Trial Designed to Accelerate Development in ccRCC
 



The Phase 1b trial is evaluating batiraxcept at doses of 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, plus cabozantinib 60 mg daily in previously treated (2L+) patients with ccRCC. Prior treatment with cabozantinib was not allowed. The primary objective is safety; secondary and exploratory objectives include identification of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR). Given baseline levels of serum soluble AXL (sAXL)/GAS6 correlated to clinical activity in the Company’s Phase 1b trial of batiraxcept in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, one of the objectives of the ccRCC trial is to correlate baseline sAXL/GAS6 with response in patients with ccRCC treated with batiraxcept plus cabozantinib. We dosed two cohorts of patients, one at the 15 mg/kg dose and the second at 20mg/kg dose. A review of the Phase 1b data demonstrates that 15mg/kg batiraxcept is an appropriate dose to suppress serum GAS6 levels in these patients being treated with cabozantinib and that 20mg/kg batiraxcept does not provide additional clinical activity beyond that seen with 15mg/kg batiraxcept, consistent with the modeling done using the Phase 1b PROC data.
 
In January 2022, the Company announced the first patient was dosed in the Phase 2 portion of the ccRCC trial. The Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of batiraxcept in ccRCC is an open-label study in which 55 patients are anticipated to enroll across three parts. Part A is expected to enroll approximately 25 patients and will investigate batiraxcept 15 mg/kg in combination with cabozantinib in 2L+ ccRCC patients. Part B is expected to enroll approximately 20 patients and evaluate batiraxcept 15 mg/kg in combination with standard of care nivolumab and cabozantinib in first-line ccRCC patients. Part C is expected to evaluate batiraxcept 15 mg/kg monotherapy in approximately 10 patients with ccRCC who are not eligible for curative intent therapies. The primary endpoint of each part of the Phase 2 portion of the trial is ORR and key secondary endpoints include DoR, PFS, and OS. The Phase 2 portion of the ccRCC clinical trial will also explore batiraxcept effects on biomarkers (sAXL and GAS6) in serum.
 
As of February 4, 2022, 26 ccRCC patients have been treated with batiraxcept at doses of 15 mg/kg (n=16) and 20 mg/kg (n=10), plus cabozantinib 60 mg daily in previously treated (2L+) patients with ccRCC. Demographics of the evaluated 26 patients are representative of a 2L+ ccRCC population, with all patients having received a prior immunotherapy. Key findings include:
 

• | No dose limiting toxicities observed at either the 15 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg batiraxcept dose in combination with cabozantinib.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At a median follow-up of 4.9 months on February 4, 2022, 92% of patients remain on study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Best overall response rate (ORR) in the ITT population is 46% (12/26).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the 15 mg/kg population, best ORR is 56% (9/16).
--+----------------------------------------------------


o | In the 20 mg/kg population, best ORR is 30% (3/10).
--+----------------------------------------------------


o | No patient has had progressive disease as their best response.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate in the ITT population is 79%.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Median duration of response (DOR) has not been reached; the 3-month DOR is 100%.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biomarker Data
 
As previously reported, a key finding from the Company’s Phase 1b trial of batiraxcept in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is an observable correlation of baseline levels of serum soluble AXL (sAXL)/GAS6 to clinical activity. As such, one of the objectives of the ongoing Phase 1b/2 ccRCC trial is to measure the correlation of baseline sAXL/GAS6 with radiographic response in patients with ccRCC treated with batiraxcept plus cabozantinib. Ratios of sAXL/GAS6 were evaluated retrospectively.
 
Among the 26 patients treated in the ccRCC trial, 25 were evaluable for baseline sAXL/GAS6. A high ratio optimized a patient’s ability to respond to batiraxcept plus cabozantinib. Key findings from biomarker high patients include:
 

• | Best ORR rate in the biomarker high population is 63% (12/19).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the 15mg/kg population, best ORR is 75% (9/12)
--+--------------------------------------------------


o | In the 20mg/kg population, best ORR is 43% (3/7)
--+-------------------------------------------------

Third Oncology Indication-Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PA)
 
The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side and it is in the abdomen near the stomach, intestines, and other organs. The pancreas has two main jobs in the body: 1) to make juices that help digest (break down) food; and 2) to make hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, that help control blood sugar levels. Both of these hormones help the body use and store the energy it gets from food. The digestive juices are made by exocrine pancreas cells and the hormones are made by endocrine pancreas cells. About 95% of pancreatic cancers begin in exocrine cells and the most common pancreatic exocrine tumors are called adenocarcinomas. 
 
According to the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”), pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose because there aren’t any noticeable signs or symptoms in the early stages of pancreatic cancer, the symptoms are similar to those of many other illnesses, and the pancreas is hidden behind other organs. Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide. There were approximately 495,800 new cases of pancreatic cancer and 466,000 deaths from the disease worldwide in 2020. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program estimates that there will be approximately 60,430 new cases of pancreatic cancer and 48,220 deaths from the disease in the U.S. in 2021. Pancreatic cancer typically has a poor prognosis, and the five-year survival rate is approximately 11%. Per AACR, pancreatic cancer is projected to become the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide by 2025 and the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. by 2030.
 
Decision Resources Group, LLC or DRG in its December 2019 Pancreatic Cancer Disease Landscape and Forecast reports the first-line metastatic population is the largest drug-treatable population in pancreatic cancer. Correspondingly, the first-line metastatic population had the highest therapy sales ($901 million in 2018, with all but 62 million from the pancreatic exocrine tumor population), accounting for 53% of the total pancreatic cancer therapy market. By 2028, these sales will fall short by more than $100 million ($764 million in 2028), mainly because most products prescribed for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the first-line have become generically available and due to failures of several highly anticipated late-phase pipeline drugs.  However, there is a clear need for additional therapies and there is a clear trend developing towards a combinatorial approach as a substantial percentage of early-phase studies are being conducted with two or more investigational agents. The addressable population (i.e., eligible to receive gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatment) across the US and 5 major EU regions is estimated to be approximately 38,000.
 
On August 9, 2021, we announced that we had dosed the first patient in the Phase 1b portion of our Phase 1b/2 of AVB-500 as a first-line therapy in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma eligible to receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel combination therapy. The Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial will evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity in approximately 20 patients dosed with 15 mg/kg of batiraxcept in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The randomized, controlled Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial is designed to evaluate approximately 60 patients dosed with 15 mg/kg of batiraxcept as a first-line therapy in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel versus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 portion of the trial is PFS. The secondary endpoints are ORR, DoR, clinical benefit rate, safety and OS, and the exploratory endpoints are PK and pharmacodynamics.
 
In February 2022, we provided updated safety and clinical activity data from the pancreatic adenocarcinoma as of February 4, 2022.  The safety profile of batiraxcept in combination with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel was consistent with the safety profile of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel alone. Thirteen patients had been followed for at least 8 weeks and 4 out of 13 (31%) had a best response of partial response, 5 out 13 (38%) had best response of stable disease and 4 out of 13 patients (31%) had best response of progressive disease. 
 

Investigator Sponsored Trials
 
In May 2019 we entered into an institution sponsored clinical trial agreement with M.D. Anderson Cancer Center for the use of, and our supply of, batiraxcept, in combination with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP’s medicinal product durvalumab in a Phase 1/2 trial being conducted by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant, recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. In March 2020, we announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1/2 trial for the use of, and our supply of, batiraxcept, in combination with EMD Serono’s medicinal product avelumab being conducted by the University of Oklahoma for the treatment of patients with advanced urothelial cancer (COAXIN trial).

Strategic Collaborations
 
In April 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with WuXi, the objective of which is to identify and develop novel high-affinity bispecific antibodies against CCN2, also known as CTGF, implicated in cancer and fibrosis and identified from a similar target discovery screen that identified the significance of the AXL/GAS6 pathway in cancer. The goal is to generate a best-in-class therapeutic targeting desmoplasia and tumor growth in the clinic in 2023.
 
On November 6, 2020, we entered into the 3D Medicines Agreement, whereby we granted 3D Medicines an exclusive license to develop and commercialize products that contain batiraxcept as the sole drug substance for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of human oncological diseases, in the Territory.
 

GAS6-AXL Pathway
 
As illustrated in the following graphic, AXL receptor signaling plays an important role in multiple types of malignancies by promoting metastasis, cancer cell survival, resistance to treatments, and immune suppression.  
 
Figure 4: GAS6 and AXL are Overexpressed in Many Cancers and Associated with Tumor Growth,
 Metastasis, Drug Resistance, and Poor Survival
 


In preclinical studies, we have also identified high AXL expression on tumors resistant to the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy and that genetically inactivating AXL in tumors resistant to immunotherapy and radiotherapy restored anti-tumor immune response.
 
    10 

  

In preclinical studies conducted in Dr. Giaccia’s laboratories at Stanford University, Dr. Giaccia was able to demonstrate that the immune response generated by loss of AXL leads to adaptive immune resistance through PD-L1 expression and Treg (regulatory T cells) infiltration. This resulted in tumors that became sensitive to checkpoint immunotherapy when they were previously resistant. Thus, GAS6-AXL pathway inhibitors, in combination with radiation or chemotherapy and immunotherapy, may be a promising treatment regimen and may restore anti-tumor immune response.
 

Aravive-S6 (AVB-S6)
 
AVB-S6 is comprised of a family of novel, high-affinity, soluble Fc-fusion proteins designed to block the activation of the GAS6-AXL signaling pathway by intercepting GAS6 and interfering with its binding to its receptor AXL. AVB-S6 proteins have been engineered to have approximately 50 to 200 times greater affinity for human GAS6 compared to the native AXL receptor, effectively sequestering GAS6 and abrogating AXL signaling. We believe this ‘decoy receptor’ approach is well suited for AXL inhibition compared to small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors or antibodies, as illustrated by the following graphic.
 
Figure 5: Approaches to Inhibiting the GAS6/AXL Signaling Pathway
 


Preclinical Results
 
Our AVB-S6 proteins have been shown to bind GAS6 with higher affinity than the endogenous AXL protein and inhibit GAS6/AXL signaling. Initial preclinical pharmacology studies were conducted with a variety of engineered AVB-S6 proteins. The preclinical program demonstrated that high GAS6 binding affinity was critical and correlative with the ability of AVB-S6 to inhibit metastasis and disease progression in vivo. AVB-S6 proteins have demonstrated significant efficacy in mouse models of metastatic ovarian, breast, renal, and pancreatic cancers.
 

Biomarker
 
GAS6 expression in tumors has been reported to be an adverse prognostic factor in several cancers, including urothelial, ovarian, lung adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, glioblastoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, liver carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. In studies conducted by us, AVB-S6 proteins bind GAS6 with higher affinity than the endogenous AXL protein and prevent GAS6 signaling at the AXL receptor. Preclinical efficacy data for the AVB-S6 program demonstrated a relationship between reduced serum GAS6 and an anti-metastatic effect. We have developed an assay designed to measure GAS6 levels in the blood before and after dosing of our development candidate. In the presence of a pharmacologically active dose of AVB-S6, serum GAS6 has not been detectable. Thus, GAS6 levels in the blood of patients may be a pharmacodynamic biomarker that can aid AVB-S6 dose selection and potentially serve as a predictive biomarker for response to treatment with AVB-S6. Additionally, our Phase1b clinical trial identified a relationship between sAXL / GAS6 ratios as every patient that responded to treatment, regardless of chemotherapy being administered in combination, had a sAXL / GAS6 of >0.773. We will continue to explore these biomarkers in our other clinical trials.

The following graphic indicates the relationship between batiraxcept protein levels and GAS6 levels in blood from humans participating in the batiraxcept first in human trial.
 



Manufacturing 
 
Manufacturing of our clinical trial material consists of three main phases, the production of bulk protein (drug substance), formulation/filling operations, and labelling/packaging operations of the finished product. The protein has been manufactured at high yield and with high purity. The clinical bulk drug substance is produced using industry standard manufacturing processes, as is the drug product.
 
Since September 2017, we have relied on WuXi, a third-party contract manufacturer to manufacture clinical bulk drug substance and drug product of batiraxcept using a cell line and process developed by our contract manufacturer that has been licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis. We have manufactured enough batiraxcept to dose patients through the planned Phase 3 ovarian cancer trial. The clinical bulk drug substance and drug product is manufactured pursuant to the terms of a five-year Master Manufacturing Services Agreement that we entered into with our contract manufacturer in July 2016, which agreement automatically renews for successive one (1) year periods, unless either party provides written notice to the other party of its desire not to renew at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.  The Master Manufacturing Services Agreement is terminable by us upon 45 days prior written notice, by our contract manufacturer upon 180 days prior written notice provided that all statements of work in progress at such time are completed and upon 60 days prior written notice upon a breach of the terms of the agreement if such breach is not cured within such 60-day period.
 
We have also contracted with an independent third party located in Texas for the labeling, packaging, and distribution of our injectable protein.
 
Our personnel have significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality and project management experience to execute and manage manufacturing process development, plus oversee the manufacture, testing, quality release, storage and distribution of drug products according to the current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMPs”), promulgated by the FDA and other regulatory requirements. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to the organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Our facilities, and our third-party manufacturers, may be subject to periodic inspections by FDA and local authorities, which include, but are not limited to procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our biological drug candidates to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, and consent decrees causing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations plus causing possible civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of its biological drug candidates. Similar to contract manufacturers, we may encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
 

Research and Development
 
We have made and will continue to make substantial investments in research and development. Our research and development expenses totaled approximately $37.5 million and $17.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
    12 

  

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties, such as CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct clinical trials and aspects of research and preclinical testing. These third parties provide project management and monitoring services and regulatory consulting and investigative services.
 

Competition 
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. We face competition from many different sources, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies, as well as public and private research institutions. Any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing products and therapies as well as new products and therapies that may become available in the future.
 
At this time, there are no FDA or EMA approved therapies targeting GAS6. We believe this mechanism of action represents a novel approach to inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis, as well as addressing tumor immune evasion and resistance to other anticancer agents. Exelixis, Inc. markets cabozantinib, a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor which is the only currently marketed compound that inhibits AXL in addition to inhibiting several other kinases. We are aware of a number of companies focused on developing AXL inhibitors in various indications, including BerGenBio ASA, Astellas Pharma Inc., Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., Les Laboratoires Servier, SAS, Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ignyta, Inc., as well as several companies addressing AXL inhibitors, and PARP 1/2 inhibitors and related signaling pathways.
 
Our competition may also include companies that are or will be developing therapies for the same therapeutic areas that we are targeting, including ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners may have substantially greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personal, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for our programs.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain approval from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before our product is able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 

License Agreement
 
In 2012, Aravive Biologics entered into an exclusive license agreement with Leland Stanford Junior University ("Stanford University") for intellectual and tangible property rights relating to biologic inhibitors for therapeutic targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. The license agreement was amended in 2012, 2015 and 2017 to modify certain of the stated milestones and expand the patent rights granted to Aravive Biologics. The term of the license is the length of the last to expire patent. The license agreement grants Aravive Biologics exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the following patent-related rights:

As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, Aravive Biologics is obligated to pay Stanford University yearly license fees and milestone payments, and a royalty based on net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. More specifically, Aravive Biologics is obligated to pay Stanford University (i) annual license payments, (ii) milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $1,000,000 upon achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones, and (iii) royalties equal to a percentage (in the low single digits) of net sales of licensed products; provided that the annual license payments made will offset (and be credited against) any royalties due in such license year. In the event of a sublicense to a third party of any rights based on the patents that are solely owned by Stanford University, Aravive Biologics is obligated to pay royalties to Stanford University equal to a percentage of what Aravive Biologics would have been required to pay to Stanford University had it sold the products under sublicense itself. In addition, in such event Aravive Biologics is required to pay to Stanford University a percent of sublicensing income. The license agreement may be terminated by Stanford University upon 30 days written notice if Aravive Biologics breaches its obligations thereunder, including failing to make any milestone or other required payments or to exercise diligence to bring licensed products to market. In the event of a termination, Aravive Biologics will be obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. The license agreement also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia, including the licensee’s agreement to indemnify Stanford University for any liabilities arising out of or related to the licensee’s exercise of its rights under, or breach of, the license agreement, the reservation of the licensor of the right to use the licensed intellectual property rights for its internal, non-commercial purposes, limitations/disclaimers of various warranties.
 

Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) Grant
 
In 2016, Aravive Biologics was approved for a $20.0 million grant from CPRIT for development of AVB-S6. The CPRIT Grant is subject to customary CPRIT funding conditions including a matching funds requirement whereby Aravive Biologics was required to match $0.50 for every $1.00 from CPRIT. Consequently, Aravive Biologics was required to raise $10.0 million in matching funds, and it raised $11.4 million since 2016. The grant award, as is customary for all CPRIT awards, contains a requirement that Aravive Biologics pay CPRIT a tiered royalty on sales of commercial products developed using CPRIT funds equal to a low- to mid-single digit percentage of revenue until such time as CPRIT has been paid an aggregate amount equal to 400% of the grant award proceeds. After 400% of the grant award proceeds has been paid, Aravive Biologics will be obligated to pay CPRIT a royalty of less than one percent for as long as Aravive Biologics maintains government exclusivity. The CPRIT Grant contract terminated on November 30, 2019. After the termination date, we are not permitted to retain any unused grant award proceeds without CPRIT’s approval, but our royalty and other obligations, including our obligation to repay the disbursed grant proceeds under certain circumstances, to maintain certain records and documentation, to notify CPRIT of certain unexpected adverse events and our obligation to use reasonable efforts to ensure that any new or expanded preclinical testing, clinical trials, commercialization or manufacturing related to any aspect of our CPRIT project take place in Texas, survive the termination of the agreement. In addition, if we relocate our principal place of business outside of Texas within the three-year period after the date of final payment of grant funds (which final payment was received in March 2020), we are required to repay to CPRIT all grant funds received. We have received all $20 million of the grant award proceeds and have expended all of the grant award proceeds by the agreement termination date.
3D Medicines Inc. Agreement
 
On November 6, 2020, we entered into the 3D Medicines Agreement, whereby we granted 3D Medicines an exclusive license to develop and commercialize products that contain batiraxcept as the sole drug substance, for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of human oncological diseases, in the Territory.
 
Under the terms of the 3D Medicines Agreement, we received from 3D Medicines cash payments of $21 million (inclusive of $9 million in milestone payments) and are eligible to receive from 3D Medicines cash payments of up to an aggregate of $207 million (inclusive of $9 million in milestone payments) in clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments. There can be no guarantee that any such milestones will in fact be met. We are obligated to make certain payments to Stanford University based on certain amounts received from 3D Medicines under the 3D Medicines Agreement pursuant to the existing license agreement by and between us and Stanford.
 
We will also be entitled to receive tiered royalties ranging from low double digits to mid-teens on sales in the Territory, if any, of products containing batiraxcept. Royalties are payable with respect to each jurisdiction in the Territory until the latest to occur of: (i) the last-to-expire of specified patent rights in such jurisdiction in the Territory; or (ii) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale of a product in such jurisdiction in the Territory. In addition, royalties payable under the Agreement will be subject to reduction on account of generic competition under certain specified conditions, with any such reductions capped at certain percentages of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period.
 

• | Under the terms and conditions of the 3D Medicines Agreement, 3D Medicines will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of licensed products in the Territory.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If either we or 3D Medicines materially breaches the 3D Medicines Agreement and does not cure such breach, the non-breaching party may terminate the 3D Medicines Agreement in its entirety. Either party may also terminate the 3D Medicines Agreement, upon written notice, if the other party files for bankruptcy, is dissolved or has a receiver appointed for substantially all of its property. We may terminate the 3D Medicines Agreement if 3D Medicines, its affiliates or its sublicensees challenges the validity or enforceability of any of our patents covering any of the licensed compounds or products or ceases substantially all development and commercialization of licensed products in the Territory for a specified period, subject to certain exceptions. 3D Medicines may also terminate the 3D Medicines Agreement for convenience provided certain notice is provided to us.

The Agreement contemplates that we will enter in ancillary arrangements with 3D Medicines, including a clinical supply agreement and a manufacturing technology transfer agreement.
 
In August 2021, 3D Medicines received approval from the CDE of the NMPA of the IND submitted by 3D Medicines to participate in our international batiraxcept Phase 3 PROC clinical trial.
 

Intellectual Property
 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our technology and know-how to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of targeting the GAS6-AXL pathway for the identification and development of therapeutic candidates for cancer therapy and fibrosis. In addition, we rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. We also utilize trademark protection for our company name and expect to do so for products and/or services as they are marketed.
 
Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our therapeutic candidates may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
 
Our patent position with respect to the GAS6-AXL program is comprised of nine comprehensive patent portfolios containing composition of matter claims relating to novel GAS6-binding fusion proteins, claims to reagents and diagnostic methods for determining susceptibility or likelihood of a tumor to become invasive and/or metastatic, and claims to the use of our novel fusion proteins for the treatment of various oncological conditions, as well as antiviral and antifibrotic disorders. Our license agreement with Stanford University provides us with exclusive rights to intellectual property, or IP, that is either solely owned by Stanford (Portfolio I below) or co-owned by Stanford and us (Portfolios II, III, and V below). We also have rights to IP that we solely own (Portfolio IV and VI-X below).
 
As of March 15, 2022, we have exclusive rights to 31 issued patents (including the 18 validated EP countries for Portfolio I), 2 Hong Kong recorded patents, one allowed application and one pending patent application that are the subject of the license agreement with Stanford University. The expiration date for those patents/patent applications is 2031. We also have exclusive rights to 58 issued patents (including the 36 validated EP countries for Portfolio III and the 7 validated EP countries for Portfolio V) and 2 pending applications that are jointly owned with Stanford University and that are the subject of the license agreement with Stanford. The expiration dates for those patents/patent applications range from 2033-2035. We have 1 issued patent and 15 pending applications that we solely own. The expiration dates for those patents range from 2035-2042. Additional details on our relevant portfolios is provided below:

In the future, we expect to continue prosecuting broader coverage of certain composition of matter applications. Additionally, we will seek to file new patents related to novel candidates, manufacturing, clinical formulations, dose, and indications, as well as evaluate the acquisition of other innovative IP.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
 
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering its therapeutics candidates and their methods of use.
 
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these procedures, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
Government Regulation 
 
Federal, state and local government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological and pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

U.S. Drug Approval Process 
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, Public Health Service Act (the "PHSA"), and implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application ("BLA") for marketing approval that meets applicable requirements to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the product that is the subject of the BLA based on results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical trial and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 
Before testing any biological development candidate in humans, the candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations composing the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases; these phases may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the targeted disease.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    17 

  


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
 
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee on approved biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. No user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a Fast Track biological product, the FDA may consider review of completed sections of a BLA on a rolling basis provided the sponsor provides, and the FDA accepts, a schedule for the submission of the completed sections of the BLA. Under these circumstances, the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. A Fast Track designated drug candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA reviews the BLA in six months rather than ten months after it is accepted for filing.
 
    18 

  

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
 
Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 

Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as ‘off-label’ use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 
    19 

  

In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 
The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The anti-kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the anti-kickback statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Patient Protection and ACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), as discussed below.
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
    20 

  

Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal civil FCA, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services; making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim; or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Penalties for a FCA violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal FCA is a civil statute, conduct that results in a FCA violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, if approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 
HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouse, that create, receive, or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, some of which are more stringent and many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
 
Additionally, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, (with certain exceptions), to annually  report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
 
In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
    21 

  

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
 

Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost- effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The marketability of any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect the pressure on healthcare pricing will continue to increase. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 

U.S. Healthcare Reform
 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. It is unclear how these challenges and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact our business in the future.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. Additionally, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 
    22 

  

We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
 
We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
 

Foreign Regulation
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, it would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
European Data Collection
 
The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area (EEA) is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 ("GDPR"), which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EU. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data (including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements) and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million Euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR, will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 

Human Capital
 
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. Our management and scientific teams possess considerable experience in drug discovery, research, manufacturing, clinical development and regulatory matters and we believe that we benefit from this experience and industry knowledge. Our research team includes M.D., M.S., and Ph.D.-level scientists with expertise in cancer biology. As of December 31, 2021, we had 23 full-time employees, of which 15 were part of our research team and 8 were part of our general and administrative team. Of the management team, 80% are women or minorities. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Although, management continually seeks to add additional talent to its work force, management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
Competitive Pay and Benefits
 
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:

• | We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a 401K retirement plan with employer matching contributions (maximum of 2% match) and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including flexible time-off, telemedicine, and paid parental leave.

Health and Safety
 
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Accordingly, with the global spread of the ongoing novel COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the safety of our employees and our business, which include:

• | Adding work from home flexibility;
--+-----------------------------------


• | Adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our core values reflect who we are and the way our employees interact with one another, our customers, partners and shareholders. Our core values include: treating one another with respect, considering the needs of others and providing solutions to meet their needs, being constantly working to improve and willing to try new approaches, making decisions with the long-term view in mind, and acting as a team by listening to one another and working across teams toward a common goal. We collaborate to achieve results and focus on success for our patients and shareholders.
